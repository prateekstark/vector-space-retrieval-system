 Hostages freed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> from a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet came home Thursday to a tumultuous reception by thousands of people after being released by nine <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> gunmen, who slipped away. Western diplomatic sources said they had clear evidence the hijackers had reached <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after Algerian officials allowed them to go free, ending the 15-day siege. In its Friday editions, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed Arab officials as saying the hijackers had been flown on a private Algerian jet to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and were believed to have then traveled over land to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, and Crown Prince <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> led a group of government officials and relatives who were at the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> airport to meet the former captives. Flocks of doves soared over the airport as the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 carrying the 22 passengers and seven crew members touched down Thursday night after a six-hour flight from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Two other hostages released early Wednesday were Saudi Arabian citizens and were flown home in a private executive jet. Bedouin men danced and clapped at the Kuwaiti airport, and children waved flags and sang, `` God bless our father, <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>,'' referring to the emir. The Kuwaiti passengers traveled by motorcade to the city center. Thousands of people lining the route, tossing roses and confetti. Hundreds of others followed in cars and limousines, honking their horns and singing, `` We sacrifice blood and souls for you, O <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.'' The gunmen, who killed two hostages while the hijacked jumbo jet was in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> last week, disappeared before dawn Wednesday after abandoning their attempt to force <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1983. Both slain captives were Kuwaitis. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> refused any concessions to the hijackers but <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> apparently promised them passage to a country of their choice if they freed the hostages unharmed. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, criticized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> governments, has refused to acknowledge making a deal with the hijackers. There was no reference to them Thursday in any of the North African country's state-controlled media. Several of the returning Kuwaiti passengers accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of complicity in the hijacking, saying one gunman was replaced by two others when the craft landed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` One of the two was obviously a military pilot. He was ordering other gunmen around and telling them lots of things about the aircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts of the plane,'' said passenger <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Zaferi </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, a brief farewell was held at the <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before the former hostages were flown to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The former captives included three cousins of <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, ruler of the sheikdom. Compared with their tense, trembling appearance when they had emerged from the hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, the former captives looked rested and relaxed. <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, second cousin of the emir, said the hijackers treated her and her sister `` with deference and without brutality.'' Their brother, <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, said he was `` psychologically fatigued'' when he made a statement by radio to the control tower asking that the gunmen's demands be met. After their release, the hostages spent 30 hours at the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> military hospital being examined. A Kuwaiti doctor said all were in good physical condition but the psychological effects of the long, terrifying confinement may be felt for weeks or months. Algerian authorities would not permit journalists to inspect the hijacked plane, which awaited a relief crew to return it to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> official said the hijackers deliberately damaged the radio equipment before leaving. A member of the airport cleanup crew said trash was strewn through the aircraft, ropes had been used to divide the seating area and a large world map had been pinned to the wall of the forward cabin. He said the stench of rotting fruit filled the plane. Other Arab countries, including <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, praised <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for achieving freedom for the hostages without additional violence. Algerian media called it a `` victory'' but Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western leaders criticized <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for allowing the hijackers to get away. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not rest until the terrorists, the murderers, the hijackers are brought to justice,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She declined to say what steps might be taken but said officials are checking to see whether laws apply that allow charges against hijackers when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen is involved. At least one passenger carried an American passport. An international convention calls for sanctions against any country allowing hijackers to escape unpunished, including an end to direct air service to the offending nation. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is not a signatory. An Soviet-built Antonov transport of the Algerian air force was seen taking off before dawn Wednesday, shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane. It was widely assumed the hijackers were aboard the Antonov, which can land on a grassy field.

 Embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was summoned to a private meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House on Wednesday after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with two <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who resigned in protest over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure, a department source said Thursday night. The source, who declined to be identified, said Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and former Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who headed the department's criminal division, met at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and some White House staff members. During that 45-minute meeting, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told the president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s behavior was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' another administration source said. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, meanwhile, `` laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment he said he would have brought against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> if he were the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been under investigation for nearly a year by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who is looking into a handful of incidents to see if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated conflict-of-interest or other federal laws. It was not immediately known what occurred during <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which immediately followed the <LOCATION> Burns-Weld </LOCATION> meeting, but <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday with <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that the president has continued to express his `` total support ... and total confidence. During the earlier White House meeting with the departing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> `` laid out the reasons why <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should leave,'' said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. He added that <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> never specifically suggested that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated the standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a 1965 executive order. Those standards, among other things, say that employees should avoid any action which could create the appearance of using public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment to any organization or person and making a government decision outside official channels. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> specifically mentioned longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, as having taken advantage of his relationship with the attorney general to promote his own business interests. Burns, while not using these specific words, in effect told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was selling the office of the attorney general,'' said the source. Another administration source familiar with the Wednesday meetings was asked about the outcome. `` As you can see, there was no change,'' he responded. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, had no immediate comment. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, a White House spokesman, said late Thursday that he was unfamiliar with either of the meetings Wednesday. `` I have no idea what you're talking about,'' he said. `` I ca n't confirm or deny. He noted, however, that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said this week that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has `` full confidence'' in <LOCATION> Meese </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> have not discussed publicly their reasons for submitting their resignations March 29, but sources close to them have said they felt that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure in the department while he is under investigation by an independent counsel was hampering department operations. During the White House meeting, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that if he were the special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, he would seek an indictment of the attorney general, said the administration source. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had made similar comments to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on March 29 when <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> announced to the attorney general that they were resigning. According to the source, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> in the meeting with the president `` laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment. `` The president was very attentive, listened to the story, got up and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> came in'' after <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> left, said the administration source. In the past, said several sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> associates that he feels a number of felony charges could be lodged against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> based on the factual evidence known to date in the nearly year-long probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. These include conspiracy counts involving the acceptance of illegal gratuities, a violation of Ethics in Government Act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes to foreign officials. One knowledgeable source said that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had been summoned to the White House and met privately with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and possibly <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on the day he resigned. The source was unable to provide any details of that conversation. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is looking into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ties to the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is also known to be looking into Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s $ 40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary is underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a tax-exempt philanthropy run by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate family. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that a partnership headed by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, the foundation's vice president, owned a building for which the government signed a $ 50 million lease for a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office building in May 1987. Thirteen days after signing the lease, the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership sold the building for a $ 22.6 million profit. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and said he did n't have anything to do with the lease. The attorney general said Thursday that he meets the highest ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no factor `` right now that would cause me to resign.'' In the interview published in Friday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the president has continued to express his `` total support ... and total confidence.'' However, he did not rule out resigning before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends. `` I've never set a particular limit of how long I would stay or how long I would n't stay. A lot would depend upon my own post-federal service employment situation and so on,'' he said.

 `` I like everything you said,'' the old man told <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the campaign trail, `` but ... wo n't the Republicans be able to clobber you and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on the basis of your lack of governmental experience?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> looked around the hall. He was in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb, addressing senior citizens who had just listened to a litany of legislative accomplishments from Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, one of his rivals for the presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was ready for this often asked question. In the first place, he said, the Reagan-Bush administration has experience and look what they've done _ a record trade deficit, a record debt, a mess in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and `` the most sleaze and corruption in ... American history.'' Then he launched into his own record of leadership in civil rights and labor strife. `` Of those of us who are running _ if you were about to lose your farm, had to face the banker _ which one would you choose to argue your case? ... If you needed a scholarship for your child who would you want to argue your case? If you had a relative in a foreign jail, who would you send to bring your relative back home?'' Now the punchline _ `` Some office holders are not leaders and some leaders are not office holders ... I am a leader.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has never been elected to office or run a business, but he has headed a nationwide organization, the Chicago-based Operation PUSH _ <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION> _ and its education-oriented affiliate, PUSH for Excellence, or PUSH-Excel. His handling of things at PUSH has come under scrutiny for signs of how he might run the government. Over the years, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has used PUSH to keep himself in the spotlight with his crowd-stirring oratory, media-wise instincts and ability to capitalize on the latest public issues. Although he stepped down as head of PUSH when he ran for president in 1984, he often returns to lead its Saturday morning meetings. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the architect of PUSH's campaign to pressure corporations to expand hiring and business opportunities for minorities. However, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> left PUSH with a record of improper use of government money, high staff turnover and dwindling revenues. His supporters point to PUSH's achievements in strengthening black economic power as examples of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s ability and say he was a genius at keeping the organization afloat despite a chronic cash shortage. They dismiss administrative problems as mstakes made by well-meaning volunteers and low-paid staff members. `` I think he managed incredibly well given the resources he had. All civil rights organizations have always operated at a deficit,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidmore </PERSON>, a founding member of PUSH's board. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s critics maintain that PUSH operated like a personality cult, built around <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, rather than a well-managed organization. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> just does n't have the ability to keep things together,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a longtime civil rights activist and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> critic. `` When it comes to building and motivating people, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is a genius. But he ca n't sustain an effort and that is evidenced by PUSH.'' In the past decade, PUSH has been beset by troubles: _ PUSH for Excellence either misspent or failed to account for $ 1.2 million out of an estimated $ 6.6 million in federal grants from the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, Education, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, federal auditors found The government still is trying to collect the money without having to take PUSH to court. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded in a 1980 audit that PUSH-Excel's `` accounting system and internal controls are not adequate to safeguard its assets,'' or ensure reliable accounting and operating efficiency _ PUSH-Excel and Operation PUSH were hit in the 1970s and early 1980s with more than a dozen lawsuits by businesses seeking payment of overdue bills for such things as telephone service, printing and paper supplies _ In <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign it was revealed the PUSH organizations had received a $ 10,000 donation from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and $ 200,000 from the League of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The contributions were made after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> toured the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in 1979 and was photographed embracing <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said recently that the contribution was made because of `` a growing affinity between the Arab-American and black communities'' at that time. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> has not donated any money since then to the PUSH network.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: PUSH network.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 On the other side of the ledger, PUSH improved business opportunities for blacks by persuading corporations to sign `` covenants'' promising jobs and franchises to minorities _ often after PUSH threatened or carried out boycotts of a company's product From the start, on Christmas 1971, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> vowed the group would `` picket, vote and if necessary engage in civil disobedience'' to achieve its goals. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, now a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, recalled <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had quit as head of a similar group, Operation Breadbasket, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, after clashing with <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> leaders over expenditures and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s independent streak <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> built PUSH into a network with chapters in 32 cities, taking in $ 16.8 million from 1975 to 1986, the last year for which state financial records were filed. He also used the PUSH platform to take on the administrations of several presidents and the city hierarchy of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on a range of issues, from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to contracts for minority-owned businesses. PUSH's Saturday meetings are part of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s political landscape, mixing the gospel flavor of a Southern church revival with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stirring speeches on the day's hot issues. From the PUSH pulpit, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pressured companies, such as Burger King and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, to sign minority opportunity compacts. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> was instrumental in making a lot of opportunities available _ by that I mean distributorships, getting blacks placed in jobs in chain stores,'' said <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter. PUSH officials have long been secretive about the group's sources of money, other than to say it is supported by individual memberships that now cost $ 20 a person and donations from businesses Some of the corporations that signed covenants with PUSH also contributed money to help sponsor its annual convention or other activities. Coors Brewery, for example, gave $ 20,000 last year to a major PUSH scholarship fund-raising event in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In 1977, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> broadened PUSH's mission by starting PUSH-Excel to get inner-city youths to study harder. He spoke in packed school gymnasiums nationwide, with students joining in his trademark chant: `` I am ... somebody!'' After <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fired up the students, PUSH-Excel worked with local school officials to set up special clubs and programs to help keep the youths motivated. But federal auditors later contended that government money received from 1979 to 1982 went for such layouts as $ 211 for music and flowers for a 1979 press party in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; `` $ 650 for Christmas cards purchased for a related organization''; $ 28 for funeral flowers, and $ 15 for a parking ticket. The government has referred PUSH-Excel's $ 1.2 million debt to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for collection. `` As of now, we have n't been able to resolve it,'' said Justice spokesman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. PUSH-Excel dramatized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strengths, and weaknesses, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, an education professor who has just finished writing a book about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the student-motivation program. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> had a lot of very good ideas. He has trouble carrying them through _ that has been his problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, who is director of the policy studies laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. `` They went through three or four directors, one right after the other, and this was part of his difficulty in administering the program,'' House said. By 1986, PUSH-Excel's revenues, which peaked at $ 2.6 million in 1980, had dropped to $ 209,071 and the group ended the year with a $ 1.5 million debt, including the money owed to the government. Operation PUSH was n't much better off. It started 1986 with a $ 339,056 deficit, but took in enough money to reduce the debt to $ 84,914 by the end of the year, according to its annual report filed with the state. The Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, PUSH's national executive director, did not return repeated telephone calls asking for information about the organization's current financial status. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s longtime aide and spokesman, said he understood the group had succeeded this year in nearly erasing its deficit. Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was PUSH's driving force, his supporters say he should n't be blamed for organizational problems in areas delegated to subordinates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself has said he did n't get involved in mechanical details. `` If there was anything sloppy about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s management, it was that he could not afford paid, competent people to deal with the various functions of accounting and management of government programs,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> H.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bookins </PERSON>, a leader in the African Methodist Episcopal church and a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s main thrust was at raising funds to keep the organization afloat. So it was impossible for him to be a hands-on manager of things,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters point to the success of his 1988 presidential campaign as evidence he can recruit able people to assist him. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who worked as PUSH's national executive director in 1972, said he sees a different <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> today. `` From the time I worked with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, it seems to me he has grown tremendously and his campaign points out one thing _ he has delegated authority.

 A state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel agreed that swing is the thing. Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to approve a bill that would designate the West Coast Swing Dance as the official state dance. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said the dance, also known as swing, whip, or jitterbug, is the only dance native to the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that has survived. It originated in the early 1930s, he said, adding that devotees of the art come from every ethnic, religious, racial or economic background. The committee's 4-0 vote sent swing over its first legislative hurdle. It faces further votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> before it would go to the governor for his signature. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> several years ago rejected a bill that would have made the square dance the official state dance.

<HEAD>Finance Committee Clears Bill To Overhaul Welfare System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is likely to join the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in approving major changes in the nation's welfare system, despite the near certainty that a presidential veto lies at the end of the long road to congressional consensus. The 25-year drive to overhaul welfare took a significant step forward Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 17-3 to send a comprehensive reform measure to the floor. The five-year, $ 2.8 billion `` Family Security Act'' reflects a hard-won bipartisan consensus that welfare parents should work to support their children, that the goverment should help make this possible and that government aid should be a last resort. The bill was shaped during months of negotiations and had garnered 56 co-sponsors by the time the committee acted. Most of the Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, voted in favor of it. `` For all the troubles, in the end, we agree,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chief sponsor and architect of the plan. `` We learned to talk to each other and listen and learn.'' While a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and Republicans may have reached a fragile consensus, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have raised numerous objections to the bill and have said they will recommend a veto. But <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said the support of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has killed many reform efforts in the last two decades, is evidence that welfare reform has come too far to fail. `` If the president vetoes it, the next president will sign it,'' he said. Both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, have said they want to complete <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill and achieve a compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before the end of the The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a broad plan last year that, according to rough, preliminary estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, would cost $ 7.1 billion over five years. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would give states financial incentives to raise their benefits until 1991. In many states, welfare payments amount to less than half the federal poverty standard. Both bills would require states to take stronger steps to establish paternity and collect child support from absent parents. The provisions include automatic wage-withholding from paychecks in some cases. States would also have to set up education, training and job programs for welfare recipients and spend half their money on those considered most difficult to help, such as teen-age mothers. Child care, transportation and Medicaid assistance would be provided. And states would have to allow cash benefits for two-parent families in which the principal wage-earner is unemployed. Only 26 now do so. The bill says the assistance would only have to be available for six months of each year. Voting against the bill were Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, echoing the administration's objections, said the bill would increase rather than decrease welfare dependency. He said the two-parent welfare provision would add 130,000 families to the rolls while transitional child care and medical benefits for recipients moving into the workforce would add another 500,000. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and the administration support a less expensive $ 913 million plan that has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Republicans. The money for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would be raised by extending the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s debt collection program and phasing out child-care tax credits for high-income families. In holding hearings and making arguments for his bill, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> often noted that one out of three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children is on welfare before the age of 18.

<HEAD>Farm Belt, Mountain States' Income Catching Up With Coastal States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government statistics may be signaling the beginning of the end of a mid-1980s trend that saw booming growth in coastal states outstrip the rest of the country, economists say. Residents of densely populated coastal states like <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> continued to have the highest average incomes in the nation last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. States like <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> that are dependent on farming, mining or oil were at or near the bottom. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> was the highest-income state in the nation, with an average of $ 20,980 earned for every man, woman and child in 1987. That was more than double the $ 10,204 income in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the perennial last-place finisher. Also as in the recent past, income growth was strongest in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and weakest in energy and mining states. But, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePass </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, says the figures show growth is accelerating in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> regions and slowing elsewhere. The national average in 1987 was $ 15,340, up 4.8 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 4.4 percent inflation rate into account, it was the worst gain since the recession year of 1982. That was reflected in even the healthiest regions. The growth of income in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> fell from 7.6 percent in 1986 to 6.7 percent last year. Income growth slipped from 6.5 percent to 6 percent in the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states. However, income growth in the tottering <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> increased from 0.9 percent to 2.2 percent. It improved in the Mountain states from 3.5 percent to 3.6 percent. `` I think it's signaling the end of the bicoastal economy,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zandi </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-area forecasting service. `` The bicoastal trend came to the forefront in 1984 and continued on through most of the first half of 1987. Since last summer ... the bicoastal phenomenon has been on the wane,'' <PERSON> Zandi </PERSON> said. `` As we move into 1989 and 1990, it will become a thing of the past, almost as the Sun Belt-Frost Belt phenomenon waned in the middle 1980s,'' he said. <PERSON> Zandi </PERSON> cited these reasons: _ The increase in exports, which are growing as the falling dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper overseas, will boost manufacturing in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and in parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> _ Oil and commodity prices are on the way up, brightening prospects for the Oil Patch, Farm Belt and mining states _ Growth in the economy's service sector _ which had benefited financial centers like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ is slowing The effects of the October stock market collapse are more severe there than elsewhere. _ Eastern states and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which rode the growth of high technology firms, are running into a tight labor market, making it likely that companies will look to expand elsewhere `` We can expect to see slower growth in the bicoastal states and stronger growth in the states in the middle,'' <PERSON> Zandi </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, with income of $ 20,067, ranked second in 1987 and <LOCATION> Masschussetts </LOCATION>, with income of $ 18,926, was third. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, with income of $ 20,303, would have been second if it was included in the rankings. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which took over the No. 1 spot from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> at the start of the oil boom in 1973 and held it until 1985, fell to fifth in 1987 Its average income actually fell 0.7 percent last year to $ 17,886. Rounding out the top 10 were <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Seven of the 10 states with the lowest per capita income were in the South. In addition to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, they were <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> _ energy and mining states _ were also in the lowest 10. Other than <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was the only state where average income declined in 1987, by 0.1 percent to $ 12,759. But the shrinkage was not as bad as the state's 1.1 percent decline in 1986.

 The steeple stands upright amid the tornado-tossed rubble of <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, but it is on the floor, not the roof _ a symbol of the damage to this rural town and its determination to rebuild. `` We are going to have a prayer meeting,'' church member <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollingsworth </PERSON> said Wednesday as she searched the debris for church records and hymn books. `` We are dragging out chairs to have a service on the lawn, or somewhere.'' The roof was torn out from underneath the steeple by Tuesday's predawn tornado, which left a 12-mile path of destruction in this <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town of 3,500 residents Four people were killed and at least 18 injured. Preliminary damage estimates ranged up to $ 27 million. `` No event, with the exception of World War II, affected people like yesterday,'' said T.C. <PERSON> Merchant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 72, editor of The Madison Enterprise-Review. `` It looked like some 500-pound bombs dropped out there.'' State damage-assessment teams surveyed the area 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> to support a state application for federal aid, and damage figures were expected today, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. Insurance adjusters took pictures and videotapes of the damage, and utility crews replaced damaged power lines and poles. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> reported 17 homes destroyed and 30 heavily damaged by the tornado. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> damage assessment coordinator, said residential damage ranged from $ 600,000 to $ 700,000. But <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, claims manager with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, said he thought residential damages would be at least $ 2 million. `` We have n't found anything yet that could be called salvageable,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 53, whose home was demolished. `` We've got basic coverage. I'm sure, like everybody else, we do n't have enough to cover everything `` The good Lord helped us accumulate what little we did have, and he will help us again. ... We're so glad to be out of this alive,'' <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said the campus lost at least three buildings and nine were heavily damaged. He estimated fixing or replacing them, including a nearly completed regional library, could cost $ 20 million to $ 25 million. Damage at a shopping mall, chicken farm, utilities and other property had n't been calculated. A disaster declaration signed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Tuesday allowed state agencies to provide equipment and cleanup crews. More than 100 inmates from the region's jails were organized into road gangs, said <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON>. The state's worst tornado since 1966 killed four people in a minutes. Three others remained hospitalized Wednesday night.

<HEAD>Deadline Extension Clears First Of Three Hurdles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A measure extending the deadline for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty faces a difficult fight in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a possible presidential veto after clearing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a narrow margin. The 213-201 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote Wednesday would move the deadline from May 4 to Nov. 30. The extension would represent the first change in the landmark immigration law signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in November 1986. But the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning late Wednesday to potential applicants that they should heed the current May 4 deadline. `` INS is concerned that this misguided legislation will create confusion among potential applicants and cause them to delay filing beyond the May 4 cutoff date,'' the service said in a statement. It said legalization offices will remain open on May 4 until midnight to process applications and that aliens should `` continue to expect that the last date'' to apply will be May 4. The immigration law enacted in 1986 was finely tuned legislation that carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. The narrow margin of Wednesday's vote demonstrated that amnesty for those who came to this country illegally remains an emotional issue. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the amnesty program as part of the immigration bill by only seven votes. The extension is opposed by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., the chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> author of the 1986 law, and other conservatives The immigration law is a delicately balanced bill that uses a carrot and stick approach to stop illegal aliens from pouring across <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders. Aliens who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally, but have lived here continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, were given one year to apply for temporary residency as the first step toward permanent status. The 12-month deadline is May 4. On the enforcement side, the law established severe fines for employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. Those favoring the extension argue the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reacted too slowly at the onset of the amnesty period, and did not get out the word to the immigrant communities to apply for temporary residency. In addition, many illegal aliens were thought to fear appearing at an office of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that is also in the business of deporting those here illegally. In fact, the law prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> amnesty employees from sharing their records with enforcement agents. Those opposing the amnesty extension in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were basically the same members who never liked the idea. They said that aliens who refused to come forward were simply procrastinators, and that the carefully structured bill should not be changed to accommodate them. With the deadline approaching, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> advocate of the extension, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., plans to have a vote scheduled quickly in that chamber He is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> and sponsored the chamber's extension proposal If the bill should get through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, there could be additional problems at the White House. The commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, and Office of Management and Budget officials, have already said they would recommend a presidential veto if the bill reaches <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> commented Wednesday, `` Our numbers are right on target with the projections we used when we passed the bill. I do not honestly see a need or justification for extending the signup period.'' During House debate, the chief sponsor of the extension, Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky. said 1.2 million aliens have applied for the general amnesty program, and 729,000 have received temporary residency cards Another 400,000 have applied for a separate agricultural amnesty program that is not affected by the extension legislation. Before the final vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved by voice vote an amendment designed to cut down on fraud during any extension period. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also defeated 167-246 an amendment that would have only accepted applications after May 4 from aliens who could demonstrate `` good cause'' for missing the deadline.

 A 22-year-old woman who murdered her husband with a hammer shortly after her wedding will inherit his estate, a court has ruled. The <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, reporting the case Wednesday, said the court ruled that murder committed while under temporary insanity does not disqualify the killer from inheriting the victim's estate. The victim's handicapped mother challenged the bequest of family heirlooms to the widow. `` I understand the law _ in principle _ but in this case it's twisted,'' the mother was quoted as saying. Under Swedish press laws, the people involved can not be identified. The wife was committed to a mental institution.

The remarks by <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> came in the third day of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract talks and a day after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> earned $ 17.9 million in 1987 in salary, cash and stock bonuses and money earned exercising stock options granted when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> stock was a fraction of its present value. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s 1987 earnings made him the highest-paid auto executive for the second year in a row. In 1986, when he earned $ 20.6 million, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also was the nation's highest-paid executive. `` Executive compensations have gotten completely out of hand. ... It makes it extremely difficult for us to sit down in a rational manner and try to negotiate a decent contract,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said, adding that after hearing about <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s pay, workers called union officials demanding higher pay and other benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, the company's chief negotiator, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has asked union leaders to support a company push for adoption of so-called Modern Operating Agreements at all plants. The Japanese-style MOA system organizes workers into teams, uses them for a variety of jobs instead of a single defined task and reduces the number of workers needed to fill in for absentees, inspect products and correct mistakes. `` We think it is only fair that since they ask us to go to a Japanese production system such as MOAs and team concept ... it is fair for them to go to the Japanese system in terms of compensation,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. Japanese managers earn six to eight times more than Japanese workers, while American managers earn about 18 times more than their workers, and in <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s case, 27 times, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers earn $ 14.43 an hour including cost-of-living adjustments, or gross base pay of about $ 30,000. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> also said that before Japanese workers are laid off or their pay is cut, Japanese managers take a pay cut. The Chrysler contract expires Sept. 14. It covers 59,000 active workers and 7,000 on layoff in 15 states and 65,000 retirees. Negotiators return to the table Monday prepared to bargain continuously until a contract is reached, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said.

 A man demanding to talk with <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s basketball coach entered the outer cage of <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger mascot Wednesday but gave up after a five-hour standoff, authorities said <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said that the intruder had threatened to free the 13-year-old, 500-pound tiger but that marksmen with tranquilizer guns were nearby. The man had also claimed to have a bomb in a bag, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. At one point, students who came to watch chanted: `` Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry raised at <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> sporting events when the opposing team enters. The man was recognized by students as <PERSON> Moacyr </PERSON> `` Bruno'' Cezar, an ardent fan of the basketball team who lives in <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s athletic dormitory in return for doing work around the place. `` He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporary visa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>. At one point, negotiators passed a document through the bars to him. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said it was `` an application for employment.'' Cezar surrendered at 10:10 p.m. after talking with <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, the Spanish-speaking <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> center who is from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Accompanied by a priest and two detectives, <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> was taken to the police station. No charges had been filed by late Wednesday night. `` He's upset, man. He's going to be all right. He'll talk to you tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said. The coach, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but his wife, <PERSON> Vonnie </PERSON>, and some of <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s Spanish-speaking basketball players were among those trying to talk Cezar out. Cezar is a Brazilian who speaks mainly Portugese. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was told of the incident but had no immediate plans to return, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> had entered a cage surrounding the one in which the tiger is kept by taking the keys from the animal's trainer, who was cleaning the cage, said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>. `` This individual walked up and demanded the keys to the cage. He threatened the trainer. The trainer thinks he had a gun, but he's not sure,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. No weapons or bomb were found when the standoff ended, he said. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the intruder for a time held both the trainer and an unidentified young woman inside the cage as his hostages. A police SWAT team stood about 100 yards away during the standoff. By nightfall, hundreds of students, <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> officials and reporters had flocked to the cage between the football stadium and the arena where the basketball team plays. <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said the intruder had been befriended by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and had become one of the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> basketball team's most enthusiastic fans. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the man also had been enrolled in an LSU program to improve his English. `` He's been a volunteer observer of <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> basketball for the past two years and has been quite close to Coach <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Notches Best Fund-Raising Month Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is moving up to the fund-raising league of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has consistently outpaced all other Democratic presidential candidates, new financial reports show. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last month raised a total of $ 3.4 million, including $ 621,098 in federal matching funds. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reported raising $ 2.8 million, including $ 330,189 from the federal matching account. It was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s biggest ever fund-raising month. In money that came directly from contributors, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took in $ 2 million, to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' $ 2.4 million. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was expected to suspend his campaign today, ran up a debt of $ 1.6 million during March. He took out $ 1.5 million in loans, including $ 40,000 in a personal loan to the campaign. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> borrowed the money to spend on the March 8 Super Tuesday series of 20 primaries, on which he had pinned his hopes. He then borrowed another $ 100,000 more this month before Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, where he pulled a disappointing 10 percent of the vote, trailing far behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has taken no loans. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> borrowed $ 250,000 during March. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s overall receipts for March were $ 3.4 million, of which $ 336,312 was matching funds, his report showed. Because he received less than 10 percent of the vote in two previous successive primaries, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> lost his eligibility for federal matching funds under election law. He would have to get an unlikely 20 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary next week in order to re-establish his eligibility. Among Republicans, former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> borrowed $ 410,000 to keep his campaign afloat during March, including a $ 25,000 loan from himself to the campaign. He has had to lay off most of his staff and almost totally eliminate other campaign expenditures because he was up against the maximum $ 27 million spending cap that the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> imposes on candidates who receive federal matching funds. He ended March with $ 1.4 million in debts and only $ 61,890 in cash on hand. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> spent $ 7.8 million during March repaying some of his previous bank loans. He has conceded that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win the nomination but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> technically remains a candidate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fund-raising crew has closed up shop, having raised the maximum $ 27 million that primary candidates can spend. During March, he raised $ 1.7 million, of which $ 247,118 was in the form of federal matching funds. He ended the month with $ 3.6 million in the bank to cover close to $ 1 million in outstanding obligations. At the end of March he had spent $ 18.9 million against the base spending cap of $ 23 million, plus the maximum $ 4.6 million allowed for fund-raising expenses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s treasurer, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said earlier this month that overall fund raising for the campaign had hit $ 30 million. That included $ 3 million for legal and accounting costs, which are not subject to the spending limit. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> reported raising $ 2.3 million during March, of which $ 896,551 was federal matching funds, and $ 873,444 was money from contributors. With the expensive June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest still down the road and a handful of others before it, the remaining Democrats will be refocusing on fund-raising efforts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended March with $ 1.7 million in cash on hand to cover $ 697,162 in bills. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had $ 865,946 in the bank and $ 678,973 in debts. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ended the month with a debt of $ 1.6 million, and $ 416,603 in cash on hand. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who dropped out of the race during March, was left with a debt. He ended the month $ 672,826 in the red, but was anticipating more than $ 500,000 in federal matching funds to help retire that. He had only $ 57,741 in the bank, after raising $ 604,586 during the month.

<TEXT>
 A volunteer program backed by the local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has been launched to prepare Chileans for their first election in 15 years and, organizers hope, calm the country's stormy political waters. However, the effort already has stirred up controversy of its own, drawing fire from backers of the right-wing military government which charges that it favors the opposition. Leaders of the program, called the Crusade for Citizen Participation, say they hope to recruit 200,000 volunteers across the country for a door-to-door campaign starting in July. They say the aim is to promote voter registration and to provide electors with non-partisan information about their options. `` Most people want a peaceful transition to democracy,'' the crusade's director, <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` It's our task to see that this happens. She said the crusade's participants also will monitor the election's outcome to ensure that it is `` respectable and respected.'' The government plans a yes-or-no ballot later this year on a single presidential candidate to be picked by the chiefs of the armed forces and national police. No date has been set. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the right-wing army commander who seized power in a 1973 coup, is seen as the most likely candidate. In order to win, the candidate must garner 50 percent of the yes vote plus one. If the candidate wins, he will begin an eight-year term in March 1989. If he loses, an open election will be held in early 1990 and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain in power in the meantime, according to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 1980 Constitution The country's last election was in March 1973. The military government has held, and won, two referendums on political or constitutional questions. Mrs. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a university professor and social worker active in church affairs, said she came up with the idea for the crusade a year ago. Under the auspices of a church-run foundation, she studied similar projects in other countries. They included <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, which have returned to civilian rule in recent years, as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I had trouble crystallizing the idea, so it helped a great deal to visit and study similar programs elsewhere,'' she said. She obtained a $ 1 million grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, to print educational material, train volunteers and pay for television and radio publicity. The training manuals for volunteers quickly prompted charges of bias from pro-government sectors for instructing that, in part, a `` yes'' vote means `` giving support to the operation of a presidentialist, authoritarian regime characterized by ... a regime of limited citizen participation.'' A `` no'' vote means `` re-establishing a balance of powers'' and `` eliminating the control by the armed forces over civilian authorities,'' the instructions say. Citing the material, a commentary in the government-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION> complained of the crusade's `` slanted, tendentious and partisan spirit.'' `` Its leaders do n't even bother to disguise their opposition tendencies,'' the commentary said. Mrs. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> responded: `` Because we live in such a polarized atmosphere, to talk of democracy is to already take a side. This is the difficulty we are facing.'' She said describing the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government as authoritarian `` is a fact, not a value judgement. I'm not using it in the pejorative sense.'' The crusade appears highly organized. Several supervisors said they took part in organizing Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s April 1987 tour of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and were drawing on that experience. At a Roman Catholic retreat in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tralca </LOCATION>, a coastal community 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, hundreds of `` first-level'' volunteers from across the country receive intensive training in three-day sessions. They are required to recruit other volunteers in their regions, who in turn will seek out more participants in each community. When the voting takes place, the crusade will be out to try to ensure `` that there is no undue pressure from any sector,'' she said. The Punta de Tralca training sessions have a distinct Catholic, missionary flavor. Upon graduation, the trainees sing a religious hymn and are given neckerchiefs of yellow and white, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> colors. The crusade's logo, of the same colors, is in the shape of a cross. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, like other <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, is overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. At the end of one recent training session, a <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arregui </PERSON>, told the volunteers they were `` like lights, small and fragile, that are going to light up <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> from end to end.'' `` You are carriers of a great message, a message that should change this nation,'' he said. Above him a broad banner quoted Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II: `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has a vocation of comprehension, not confrontation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said a central goal of the crusade is to inject some reason into <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s highly impassioned political arena, where pro- and anti-government sectors wildly sling charges at each other. For the opposition, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is a bloodstained tyrant, while he calls opposition leaders the selfish pawns of international communism. `` An important number of people have already decided whether to vote yes or no,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said. `` But when you talk to them, you realize that often they are decisions of an emotional, not rational, basis.'' The more rational the political debate, the less likely it is that turmoil will break out when the election is decided, she said. `` We are trying to promote proper civic behavior.''

 American Ballet Theater's new production of `` Gaite Parisienne'' is more extravagantly colorful than a kaleidoscope. The dancing and ebullient Offenbach music hold their own so it's really a spirit-lifting ballet and not just a theatrical fashion show Still, on first viewing Wednesday, one was primarily dazzled by the costumes of the cancan girls _ black hose and shoes with white polka dots, bright skirts with fuzzy pastel linings, blouses with huge polka dots and full sleeves gathered at the elbows above black gloves. <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> as <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Lionne </PERSON>, the celebrity of the hour, appeared in a lavish red headdress and gown _ the train had a train sewn on piggyback. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> couturier <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> was the designer and in the spirit of the occasion some women in the benefit audience wore <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> gowns. It was said that the ballet's lavish costumes cost more than $ 500,000, paid for by a private donor. <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s scenery, with a pink polka-dotted bow holding up the chandelier, was the perfect setting The Leonide Massine ballet premiered in April 1938 in <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>. It was staged for American Ballet Theater by <PERSON> Massine </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON> and premiered in January in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON> <PERSON> Massine </PERSON> has gone for character more than plot in staging this ballet set in a late 1880s French cabaret. And there is much going on in this production; there are no quiet moments. Somebody _ waiters, maids, ladies of the evening, billiard players, soldiers and dandies or just the busboy _ is always dancing. It's as fizzy as French champagne. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> danced the glove seller on Wednesday, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> the flower girl, <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Renvall </PERSON> the Peruvian and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> the Baron. <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Delarova </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who danced the flower girl and <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> at the 1938 premiere, and <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON>, who danced the glove seller at the American premiere at the Metropolitan Opera later that year, watched the ballet from a center box after being introduced from the stage.

 Two people were killed and the livelihoods of 40,000 were threatened when a reservoir holding toxic chemical waste burst last week in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today. The newspaper said that on April 14 a gate collapsed of a molybdenum waste reservoir of the <ORGANIZATION> Jinduicheng </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Molybdenum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, sending poisoned water surging into the nearby <LOCATION> Liyu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Molybdenum is a metallic substance used chiefly in strengthening steel. The deluge also flowed into two other rivers, washing away 137,000 trees, swamping 52 wells, toppling 25 wooden bridges and damaging 15 miles of river embankment, the paper said. Two villagers drowned when caught in the flood while crossing a river. The daily said villagers were warned not to drink from contaminated rivers and wells.

 The Roman Catholic Carmelite convent on the grounds of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> is being renovated, French Rabbi <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahri </PERSON> said after visiting the World War II Nazi death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Jews by the hundreds of thousands died in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>'s gas chambers. The international Jewish community opposed plans to establish a convent there and an agreement was signed Feb. 22 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to move the convent to a nearby location within two years. <PERSON> Fahri </PERSON> said on Wednesday, `` During a pilgrimage I organized at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> on April 17, I could see that the building housing the convent had been completely sandblasted, both inside and outside. `` The facade and the roofing of the convent have been completely redone. Last year, the building was simply falling apart.'' He said a deputy archbishop at <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, seemed `` embarrassed'' when asked about the renovations and `` ended up by saying he did n't know anything.''

 Relatives of some American servicemen missing in the Vietnam War say the government is hiding information that may show some prisoners are still alive, and they want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve a bill declassifying the data. But the administration and the official organization representing POW-MIA families say there is no truth to the charges, and they oppose the measure as harmful to the American effort to account for all the missing personnel. The two sides squared off on the sensitive issue Wednesday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, which is considering the measure. Dozens of family members, many wearing buttons supporting the bill, jammed a hearing room. The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs took no action on the measure, which would require declassification of more data about so-called `` live sightings.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> still lists 2,404 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel as unaccounted for 13 years after the war ended. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said an accounting is of `` the highest national priority.'' The official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is that the administration can not rule out the possibility that some Americans are still held against their will, although <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> all say they have no prisoners. Some remains have periodically been returned from the area. Those who believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is purposefully withholding information about POWs have cited a variety of reasons. Those include the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wish for better relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and the government's refusal to admit it had left some prisoners behind after the official prisoner exchange in 1973 when 591 American POWs were set free. In recent years, a number of Americans have privately searched for Americans they believe are still being held in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but have found nothing. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has opposed those efforts. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, R-Ill., a co-sponsor of the bill, said, `` I am convinced of the possibility that there are prisoners of war from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War still alive in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and I believe that the bill is a critical step in raising the awareness necessary to find an answer and know for certain. Retired Army Col. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, father of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flier shot down 20 years ago, said he and other families have been misled by government officials about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> knowledge on the POW-MIA issue. `` It is because of those experiences and the fact that we have seen evidence in the form of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> documents proving our men were abandoned and never negotiated for, coupled with the lack of a competent intelligence capability focused on securing information on our live POWs, that we support'' the bill, he said. `` We are suspicious of everything government officials, including those in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, who said he is chairman of an organization called `` The Live <ORGANIZATION> POW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' which he said represents 1,500 POW-MIA family members. But <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, executive director the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> POW-MIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION>, noted that similar charges in 1983 led to a similar bill, which was rejected by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. She added that `` two congressional investigations, two internal <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audits and a special study by Lt. <PERSON> Gen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tighe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USAF </ORGANIZATION> retired, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, have completely discredited those unfounded allegations.'' `` We have total confidence in the president's commitment and determination to fulfill his pledge to act decisively on confirmed information,'' she said. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of defense, and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s special POW-MIA office, said publication of information would make it more difficult for them to gather information.

<HEAD>NHTSA Recommends Motor Home Recall for Alleged Fuel Spurting
Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reports that recreational vehicles built on a modified <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chassis may spray fuel has led federal regulators to urge a recall before the peak summer travel months. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> urged the recall `` before the warmer summer vacation season begins'' in a letter to 10 manufacturers even though the regulatory agency has not determined a safety problem exists. A consumers group estimated up to 10,000 vehicles could be recalled. Precise figures on the number of vehicles were unavailable. The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds with the auto industry and regulators, said it has received 36 reports of fuel spurting, resulting in seven fires, two injuries and one death, from motor homes built on modified P-30 chassis. The spurting occurs when fuel leaks or sprays from the filler neck, particularly after the gas cap is removed. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s recall recommendation included motor homes built on 1984 through 1986 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> P-30 chassis, equipped with a 454 V8 engine. `` Our review of the available information indicates a potential safety defect exists in the fuel reservoir system'' of certain motor homes, the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> letter said. The <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> chassis had been modified in the fuel reservoir, exhaust system or vapor recovery system, the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> letter said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McNitt </PERSON>, comptroller for <ORGANIZATION> Travelcraft </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies sent the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> letter, said the manufacturer believes its motor homes are free from safety defects. `` Basically, the only thing that is done to a unit is occasionally the gas tank that comes with a unit is replaced by a larger tank,'' he said. A study by the Center for Auto Safety concluded that 84 percent of fuel-spurting occurs between May 1 and October 1. `` All motor home owners should be alert to the danger of overpressurized fuel and never remove the fuel cap if they hear hissing from the fuel tank,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, the center's director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> of the center estimated 5,000 to 10,000 motor homes could be recalled, saying the number was imprecise because <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> was in the early stages of its investigation. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said the recall recommendation was sent to <LOCATION> Travelcraft </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Holiday Rambler, <LOCATION> Wakarusa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Honey RV, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R Custom, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Tiffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorhomes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neppannee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Xplorer Motorhome Division of <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traveler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Coachmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; and <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is increasingly popular in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but only about half of those polled there by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> believe he has done much to improve human rights in his country. `` A majority of those in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- 59 percent -RRB- maintain that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does not promote human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The West Germans are almost evenly divided on this issue. Only the British -LRB- 54 percent -RRB- say <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does at least a ` fairly good job' of promoting human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' according to an agency survey in those three nations. General attitudes about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> followed the same pattern, with 40 percent of the French having a favorable opinion and 50 percent unfavorable, 70 percent of the Germans favorable and 22 percent unfavorable, and 58 percent of the British favorable and 28 percent unfavorable. The remainder were undecided. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s popularity has climbed, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ratings have remained fairly constant over the past six months, according to the poll `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> enjoys an overwhelmingly favorable opinion in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -LRB- 90 percent -RRB- and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> -LRB- 88 percent -RRB-, and a substantially favorable image in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- 70 percent -RRB-,'' according to agency analysis of a telephone survey conducted in those three countries March 19-23. `` In the past half year, those rating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ` very favorably' have increased from 16 percent to 36 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and from 8 percent to 33 percent in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' the agency analysis said In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s popularity has remained fairly constant, with 69 percent giving him a favorable rating last September, 68 percent favorable last November, and 70 percent favorable in March. The percentage of those polled in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> who had a favorable impression of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was 62 percent, and 44 percent in both <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, about the same as last September and November. An analysis of the results, which did not indicate the number of people polled, was circulated among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials earlier this month and obtained Wednesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The poll had a margin of error of 4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>, which handles overseas cultural and public relations for the government, periodically conducts such opinion surveys. This one was designed to gauge the mood in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before the May 29-June 2 U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Among those polled, the highest priority for U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations was the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks, designed to cut long-range nuclear arsenals. The second priority was reduction in short-range nuclear weapons and the distant third priority was reducing conventional arms. That stacking of priorities appears closer to the Soviet than to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> stance. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has balked at negotiations to reduce battlefield nuclear weapons, which many Western military analysts view as necessary to deter a potential attack by Soviet conventional forces. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders want to reduce what they call a 2-1 Soviet advantage in conventional forces. Soviet officials argue that while they have the edge in some weapons, such as tanks, they trail in others, such as anti-tank weapons. The survey found high support for the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact signed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December: 93 percent in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 80 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 74 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Panel Will Consider Tougher Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee will consider a bill to break all business ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The measure would ban exports from that country into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and from this country to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and would require American companies with offices or factories in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to pull out. Supporters, the majority of them Democrats, say this is the most effective way to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into dropping its racial segregation policies. Opponents argue such a trade cutoff would cost South African blacks some 2 million jobs and would hurt American farmers and manufacturers who export their goods. The way to end apartheid is by infusing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with capital to help blacks improve their standard of living, said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` If we can help them better themselves, they will throw off their shackles on their own,'' he said. The bill would affect about $ 1.1. billion dollars of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as well as some $ 2.6 billion dollars in trade. A group of South African businessmen took out a full-page ad in Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, warning sanctions targeted at whites would stifle the country's development and hurt the black majority. Two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees approved the legislation Wednesday and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to debate it next week. Passage through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is virtually assured, but the bill's fate in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is less certain. Exempt from the ban would be the imports of strategic minerals such as chromium, platinum and manganese, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not obtain elsewhere. But the bill would require the administration to set up a program to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for such materials. The bill, authored by Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., is far more comprehensive than the sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> approved in 1986 after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overrode President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto Those measures affected about one-third of South African imports, mainly agricultural products and computers, and less than 3 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It banned new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments but permitted existing ones to remain. The new ban, which would take effect within six months of the bill's enactment, would also exempt the donation of food, medicine and other humanitarian assistance, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government aid programs for blacks. Other provisions include: _ A ban on the transport of oil to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from anywhere in the world by U.S.-owned or registered ships _ A ban on military and intelligence cooperation between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agencies and the South African authorities This would cancel the posting of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African military attaches in each other's capitals. _ A ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal leases for coal, gas and oil deals to non-Americans who invest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ Closure of two South African consulates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and limited approval of visa requests by South Africans wishing to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ A ban on direct flights to and from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Such a ban is included in the 1986 sanctions and is in effect now.

 <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> met late Wednesday with Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a government official said, after the Roman Catholic prelate celebrated an emotional and historic Mass. The Cuban leader received <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> at the presidential palace at about 11 p.m., -LRB- 10 p.m. EDT -RRB-, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Relations Ministry, after the cardinal finished saying Mass at <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s cathedral. Reporters were hustled out of the Mass at 9 p.m. and brought to the palace, where they were told <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> would be available for a photo session. But at 11:30 p.m., it was announced that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> canceled the session because <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> had been late arriving at the palace. There was no word on what was discussed or how long the meeting would last. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> received thunderous applause as he walked in a procession to the altar of the 284-year-old cathedral in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s colonial district About 2,000 people crammed the baroque building, shouting `` Bravo!'' and applauding as 75 white-cloaked clergymen walked slowly toward the altar. One man grabbed <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s hand and kissed it as he went by. `` There has been a mistake,'' the cardinal said jokingly in Spanish. `` You've welcomed me as a pope, but I am only a cardinal, a poor cardinal.'' The heat inside the cathedral was stifling and many people fanned themselves with the latest edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cardinal to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power in 1959 and this was his first Mass since arriving in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The cardinal spoke in Spanish and frequently departed from a prepared statement, according to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, editor in chief of <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a weekly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Costello briefed reporters at the presidential palace. `` The church must be allowed to develop its role as a bridge, with the freedom which allows open communication with its faithful and with the rest of society,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. Despite years of religious restrictions in this officially atheist nation, people in the crowd said they had no fear of showing their faith. One woman said her husband, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON>, has been in prison 22 years. `` He is not a criminal ... he's just a Catholic who fought against the government,'' <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> said of her husband. When asked if she was nervous about being a practicing Roman Catholic, Mrs. <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> said: `` No, that was in the past. It's different now The hands of the red Communist -LRB- government -RRB- are easier, not so harsh.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> gave a reporter a letter to give to <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, which she said was on behalf of her husband and other political prisoners. Another woman also thurst a letter in a reporter's hand. She only said the letter, in a sealed envelope, was for <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> on her husband's behalf.

<HEAD>Study Says EPA Playing `Merry-Go-Round' With Hazardous Wastes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional study says the `` Superfund'' program remains a hazardous waste `` merry-go-round'' posing long-term problems for the nation despite improvements ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Dangerous chemicals that should be destroyed are instead still being shifted from one waste dump to another or covered with caps that could allow toxics to leak into water supplies, according to the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. That is the major finding from an ongoing <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> review of the 1986 law <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s frequently criticized Superfund cleanup efforts. `` Superfund is not working,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON>, a senior associate of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee on Wednesday. `` Public expectations are not being met by the current -LRB- cleanup -RRB- program.'' In an assessment disputed by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> said, `` In too many cases little protection of public health and the environment is being obtained'' by the $ 1.6 billion Superfund is spending each year. One of the basic directives that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 was to permanently destroy `` to the maximum extent practicable'' the contaminated waste found at the worst of the nation's tens of thousands of chemical dumps. <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> said, however, that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has opted for destruction, usually by costly but effective incineration, in only 20 percent of the cleanup plans approved since the 1986 law took effect. More often, he said, waste is still being switched to other sites, covered by caps or treated through new but unproven technological processes. `` Off-site land disposal means that the hazardous waste problem rides a merry-go-round,'' <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> testified. `` The problem will keep growing faster than the solution. ... We are going to have hundreds, if not thousands, of sites around the country where the best technologies are not chosen for the cleanup.'' He also had an ominous financial warning, saying the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 estimate that the nation evenutally would have to spend $ 300 billion to clean up the mess `` may prove low.'' <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON>, who offered no new cost estimate, said the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION>'s studies of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup plans show some environmental problems are ignored in order to avoid destruction of waste <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decided to put a cap on the Compass Industries site in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> but made no commitment to treat contaminated groundwater flowing into the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, according to OTA. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup plan said, however, `` the potential for future fires and continued off-site migration of contaminants pose adverse human health and environmental impacts.'' <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> also found instances where inaccurately high cost estimates for incineration led <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to select cheaper but untested methods to destroy wastes. He said <PERSON> OTA </PERSON> believes that in these cases, incineration would have cost about the same. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the agency is aiming at permanent treatment of wastes and that a majority of the cleanups involve such treatment of at least a portion of the chemicals found at a site. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s solid waste program, said the agency has not yet settled on a definition of `` permanent.'' He said that if all hazardous waste at a site were destroyed, only six or eight cleanups could be financed each year. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is under <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> order to have 175 underway by this October.

<HEAD>Survey Critical of State Insurance Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most states are not spending enough money to properly regulate the highly sophisticated and computerized insurance industry, says a survey by a consumer group backed by insurance agents. The unusual alliance of consumer advocates and insurance salesmen concluded in a study released Wednesday that only four insurance departments _ those in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> _ spend enough to meet its standard. All of the other 43 governments surveyed need to spend more of their insurance premium tax collections to improve the industry, said the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The group recommended that 10 percent of insurance tax premiums be used to support state insurance commissions. The average found in the survey is 5.37 percent, down from 7 percent in 1985. The group, set up and funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- PIA -RRB- with longtime consumer advocate <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> as chairwoman, hopes to convince states to regulate the industry more closely. Insurance agents and most major insurance companies want this, because they want to weed out insolvent companies, said <ORGANIZATION> PIA </ORGANIZATION> President-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ream </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, at a news conference with other officials involved in the survey. The survey says states receive an `` overwhelming'' average of 23,000 complaints a year, but two-thirds of the departments surveyed do n't even have written procedures for handling the complaints. Many log complaints manually without computers, the survey says. `` Some states lack basic computer systems to deal with the massive amounts of information,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> president and a member of the survey group. `` The insurance industry is one of the most sophisticated users of computer technology, yet some insurance departments are lacking the basics in automation.'' The study recommends a group be formed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> to develop guidelines for each state department to follow in handling complaints. Ms. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a consumer specialist for Presidents <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, is PIA's consumer adviser. She said the study of 44 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> represents a breakthrough in relations beteen consumer advocates and one part of the insurance industry. Six states' departments did not respond to the initial survey sent in September 1987 and were not included in the study. <ORGANIZATION> PIA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargrave </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the study found state insurance commissions are more effective than in the past but have failed to keep pace with the industry. Other major conclusions of the report were: _ Many departments lack personnel and resources to properly regulate insurers The study recommends enough personnel for financial examinations of each insurance company at least once every three years, which is currently done by less than half the states. _ State governments allocate an average of less than six-one-hundredths of a percent of their budgets to insurance regulation, although the average consumer spends 15 percent of his disposable income on insurance _ Salaries of insurance department professionals are far below comparable salaries in the private sector and slightly below those holding comparable jobs in other branches of state government The study recommends a salary audit every two years. The survey showed annual salaries of state insurance commissioners ranging from $ 33,342 in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to $ 85,656 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and average examiner salaries varied from $ 14,682 in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to $ 69,875 in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. _ States need more actuaries and consumer professionals involved in regulating the industry The survey recommends that each state hire at least one of each.

<HEAD>Two Former Diplomats Says Financial Pressures Failing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial squeeze on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> needs to be re-evaluated because it is failing to pressure Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of office, two former diplomats told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If anything, the tactics have entrenched <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year after a career that included service as ambassador in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and deputy assistant secretary for intelligence. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` may hang on long enough ... to bring the pillars of the temple down around him, blaming the gringos for the ruin he has brought upon <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>, who left the department in a dispute with Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, who was ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administration, called on the administration to drop its policy of unilateral pressure and enlist allies in the effort to depose <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>. `` We've never had allies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to speak of,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday. The testimony came as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' principal deputy, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation reviewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moves so far and assessing options for further action. There has been division within the administration on how best to deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. One side wants to step up pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to give up power and go into exile by imposing trade sanctions or even taking military action. The other says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should negotiate and perhaps ease pressure in hopes that he will accept a graceful exit. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> told the panel <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is likely to cling to power for months, despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust him, and will likely be followed by a leftist regime. `` Even if we are successful -LRB- in deposing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB-, the price of 20 years of inexcusable tolerance and blindness is likely to be a strongly leftist government,'' he said. Such a shift to the left in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would be spurred by resentment toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of its support for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over the past two decades and its blind eye to corruption and fraudulent elections, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> testified. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has underestimated <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s staying power. He said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s durability is tied to his `` godfather'' status in the regional cocaine cartel and to deep and broad corruption in the Panamanian government and in its Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> took power following the 1981 death of former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>. `` The cancer in the PDF has metastasized,'' <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said. `` They've been at it for 20 years'' with the full knowledge of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, D-Mich., said an economic squeeze intended to chase <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has so far succeeded only in imposing hardships on the country's population `` The general remains firmly in power,'' he said. <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said financial pressures on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` bear a similarity to chemotherapy, treatment that can only work if it is of limited duration because the side effects are too great.'' Even if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaves because of the pressure, `` we face a situation in which we may wind up judging that the operation was successful but that the patient, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has died.'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> called for mediation, run by Latin Americans, between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his internal opposition. Offers to carry out such talks have been made by the church and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman accused of putting cyanide into non-prescription pain remedies that killed her husband and another woman was deeply in debt and wanted more from life than her marriage could provide, a prosecutor said. `` This is about her anger, her frustration ... her obsession,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> in opening statements Wednesday before a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, the first person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> charged with causing death by tampering with over-the-counter capsules, plotted the killings to collect insurance money but failed in her attempt to make them look like random murders, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> is charged in the June 1986 deaths of her 52-year-old husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, and of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, both of <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, by putting cyanide in capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin. The prosecution has suggested no links between the victims except the way they died. She also faces three counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3 bottle that were recovered in stores in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, suburbs between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. The deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare, and Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled all its non-prescription medicine sold in capsule form. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said that there were reasonable explanations for many of the prosecution's points and that much of its case was circumstantial. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> contended that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had an `` obsession of several years in duration'' to kill her husband. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was contacted in January 1987 by Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who said her mother had been researching drugs and contract killings for several years, according to the prosecutor <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> would take the stand to contradict her daughter's statements. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> also noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was found to have checked out five library books that discussed cyanide and poisonous doses. <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> got the books because they contained information about poisonous plants, and she was concerned about potential danger from local toxic plants to her granddaughter and children for whom she babysat. <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> also played down the couple's marital problems, saying they were due to financial stress. Although <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> became a permanent state employee in January 1986, the couple was heavily in debt and faced foreclosure on their trailer home, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> became a suspect after investigators found dozens of her fingerprints on library books about poisons and after she pushed medical authorities for a more specific cause of death after they ruled that <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, a heavy smoker, died from emphysema. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> stood to receive $ 31,000 from her husband's state life insurance policy if he died of natural causes, but $ 136,000 if the death was accidental, as in cyanide poisoning, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police officer, testified Wednesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> told him her husband took Excedrin for several days before his death, as many as four at a time, for severe headaches. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Webking </PERSON>, Sue Snow's husband, testified that his wife took two Excedrin capsules daily. `` It has a lot of caffeine in it. She would take Excedrin instead of drinking coffee.''

<TEXT>
 A year after a partially built apartment building collapsed, families, workers and rescuers who toiled for nine days in the fruitless search for survivors remain tormented by the loss of 28 lives. `` In all of my 22 years as an attorney and in all of the hundreds, if not thousands of cases I have been involved in, never have I seen the emotional effect lingering as long as I have in this case,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieder </PERSON>, lead counsel for the victims' families `` To what do I attribute that? I guess I would have to say to the enormity of the loss and the fact that the loss seemed so purposeless,'' <PERSON> Bieder </PERSON> said. One survivor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelkey </PERSON>, 44, of Prospect, was standing 20 feet away when the L'Ambiance Plaza apartment complex fell in a thundering roar on April 23, 1987. His employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Waterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, lost 11 workers. <PERSON> Pelkey </PERSON> stayed in construction work, but says he's more cautious and is disturbed by noise. `` I never talk about it,'' he said. `` None of us do.'' June Page of <LOCATION> Hamden </LOCATION> said she struggles daily with the memory of her son <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s death. Page, 30, was married but had no children. `` The hard thing is where do you go now? ... They murdered him as far as I'm concerned,'' Mrs. Page said quietly. L'Ambiance Plaza collapsed in less than 10 seconds on a Thursday at 1:37 p.m., not long after workers had returned from lunch. Within hours, an army of volunteers, many of them workers from construction jobs around booming <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, gathered at the site of what was to have been a 16-story apartment building near downtown. Floodlights were set up for the round-the-clock rescue effort, the families of missing men waited in a nearby school, and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> set up canteens to serve the rescue workers and relatives. In the first few days, hopes remained high that someone would be pulled alive from the wreckage. Sensitive microphones designed for searches in mining accidents were used to hunt for signs of life in the rubble. But nine days later, the last body was removed. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>'s director of emergency medical services, said the city carried on the nation's biggest rescue ever. The $ 7.3 million effort included 4,000 workers, 30 ambulance services, 500 emergency medical services workers, and 700 bottles of oxygen. `` I've been to plane crashes, bombings and subway fires, and I've never seen people as badly injured as I did then,'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. Best, 33, said he tried to shield people from the gruesomeness of the search for bodies and recoveries. Only he and four others removed the body parts. At one point, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said, he and the four others needed professional help. But a social worker listened to them for a few minutes `` and lost it so we had to have him removed,'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. Counseling was offered to the rescue workers, but it could not mitigate all the effects of the disaster. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> staff has had a 50 percent attrition rate since the collapse. One paramedic quit on the scene after she, not knowing she was talking to the father of a high school student working on his spring vacation, abruptly told him the boy was dead. Last October, federal investigators concluded that the collapse was triggered by a bracket that bent under heavy pressure, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> assessed a record $ 5.11 million in fines against contractors. It also led to congressional hearings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that examined the work of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering a request by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that criminal charges be brought against one contractor. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, prosecutors decided not to press criminal charges. The Pages and other victims' families have filed lawsuits against the city, the owners of the project and a subcontractor that performed the lift-slab construction technique. More lawsuits are expected. Page's father, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, was silent during a recent interview in the family's home. He sat staring at lottery tickets in his hand, but when talk turned to the collapse, tears welled up in his eyes. Page's brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, also a construction worker, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> did not feel comfortable at the site. `` He was pulled off another job to go there because they had to meet their quotas, to make sure so much work was done so they could get paid,'' the brother said. `` He was just a gentle boy,'' Mrs. Page said. `` I wish he'd never gone into construction.

 The House has voted overwhelmingly in favor of finding more drug-fighting money within current budget limits, but <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders said they would raise the limits if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agrees. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 412-0 on Wednesday to oppose a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> initiative to expand the war on drugs by increasing the spending and tax limits in the budget agreement between the president and congressional leaders. The Republican-sponsored motion instructed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget negotiators to insist the drug war be waged within the domestic spending constraints guiding the $ 1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 spending blueprint now in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. It would be `` far more easy and more dramatic to raise spending and taxes for the war on drugs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., who offered the motion But `` this is absolutely the wrong time to abandon that -LRB- budget pact -RRB- framework.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in passing its version of the fiscal 1989 budget last week, added a $ 2.6 billion trust fund above current spending limitations that could be tapped if the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> declared drugs a dire emergency. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had proposed and both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budgets already included increases in drug enforcement and education, a popular issue in an election year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, added the amendment to increase the funding further.

And House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters Wednesday he would favor raising the budget agreement's spending caps for fighting the drug problem if the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last week that the government should cut other spending if it wanted to increase the drug effort.

 Once again President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may face what he says is his saddest task: comforting the families of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen lost in the line of duty. He has had to do a lot of it. More than 300 American servicemen have lost their lives in combat or to terrorists overseas since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in January 1981. By contrast, the only servicemen who died in the line of duty during the four years <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was president were the eight killed when a helicopter collided with a transport plane during the abortive attempt in April 1980 to rescue the Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> may have added to the current toll. The White House said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned its search for a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter that disappeared Monday over the gulf. The pilot and copilot were declared missing. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might call the relatives of the missing crewmen, although he knew of no immediate plans to do so. In an interview in February, asked what his greatest regrets were about his presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke of `` calls that have had to be made to families who have lost someone'' and said, `` Those are things for which you have to be very sorry.'' Asked whether the contrast between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> figures is the fruit of a belligerent posture by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a research associate in foreign policy studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It's a tough question. `` It's hard to know what another administration would have done under the circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, author of defense studies including an analysis of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy and force planning in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who came to office charging that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had weakened <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and vowing to regain respect abroad with a stern policy toward potential foes, has sometimes raised hackles in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with his bristling rhetoric and his acts to back it up. Critics charged that he failed to think through the reasons for sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where 241 service personnel died in an attack on a Marine barracks on Oct. 23, 1983. The Marines were later withdrawn. Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also questioned the rationale for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> on Oct. 25, 1983, just two days later. By the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s count, 19 Americans were killed and 112 wounded in the three-day invasion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, of course, disagrees. Of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> peace-keeping force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said in a February interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that `` the terrible thing was that they were actually succeeding in their mission and that's why the violence was turned on them.'' And he said of the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion: `` I ... ca n't help but be proud that there is an island now down in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> where there are n't any signs ` <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> go home' but where somebody sent me a postcard the other day ... a photograph of a wall ... painted with all kinds of graffiti ... about ` God love the U.S.A.''' Other killings of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen abroad in recent years have included: _ An April 1983, bombing of the American embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which five servicemen and 12 other Americans were killed _ A September 1984 bombing of the same embassy that killed two Marine guards _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on suspected terrorist facilities in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on April 14, 1986, in which one <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-111 and its two-man crew were lost _ An Iraqi missile attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on May 17, 1987, killing 37 sailors

Convention preliminaries start here today with meetings of platform, credential, resolution and bylaws committees. And 600 to 650 delegates _ at least two-thirds of them <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters _ should be on hand when the general session convenes Friday. The Republicans will adopt what's expected to be a generally conservative platform at the convention, ending Saturday, and also complete the process of picking a 20-member delegation to the national GOP convention this summer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. At least 16 of those national convention delegates will be <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delegates. And even though Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is continuing to roll toward the Republican presidential nomination, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> coordinator says it's possible the entire <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> delegation could be for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. It's also possible that such <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> GOP luminaries as national party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Vucanovich </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and others wo n't be on the 20-member delegation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. By the time the state convention ends this weekend, all top party offices could be filled by a solid slate of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters, among them <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> coordinator <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, who is the only announced candidate for state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Wark </PERSON> says he would n't have sought the chairmanship if the incumbent, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, had n't decided to bow out. He also says his first effort will be to make party regulars feel welcome instead of ousted. `` We're not taking a cavalier attitude,'' he says. `` This is an evolutionary process of party politics ... We desperately do n't want anyone to feel that they've been kicked out They have n't been. On the other hand, says <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, `` If <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> thought it was important to have all 20 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> delegates to the national convention, it would be that.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is to address the state convention Friday, the same day <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> speaks. Besides <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, the other <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters who are candidates for various state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> offices include <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cresenta </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> for national committeewoman and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> for national committeeman.

<HEAD>Army Plans To Fire 2,600 Civilians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army will soon begin firing up to 2,600 civilian workers around the country, but remains optimistic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will help avoid furloughs for up to 150,000 more, a top general says. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s budget director, said Wednesday in an interview the service would have to reduce its civilian workforce from 412,000 to 400,000 by Oct. 1, the start of the 1989 fiscal year. That reduction is part of a cut in strength ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to meet the terms of a deficit-reduction agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last fall. `` You ca n't get those 12,000 people down solely by way of hiring freezes, reductions -LRB- in temporary workers -RRB- and early outs,'' the two-star general said. Although the number of layoffs needed is still subject to change, the current estimate `` is about 2,500 to 2,600 reductions-in-force ... to get 12,000 people off the rolls,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. The Pentagon disclosed in its fiscal 1989 budget plan last February that all the services would face reductions in civilian employment and that all but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would see actual cuts in military strength as well. The Army has said it will slash 8,600 active-duty positions this year to reach a new level of 772,300. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s comments are the first to detail the precise impact on the civilian side. The general indicated it would be premature to discuss the number of layoffs being planned at individual Army facilities, but said there were 25 to 30 bases around the country that would face civilian cuts. He said the dismissals were designed to meet the spending target set for the next fiscal year. They must be implemented soon because the service must start fiscal 1989 on Oct. 1 at the reduced employment level. Cuts to this year's budget, however, are equally severe and furloughs of civilian workers will be required this summer if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't approve a legislative proposal submitted within the past month. That bill would provide the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with expanded authority to transfer funds among different accounts and to carry certain funds over from year to year, <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` We have had indications from at least five -LRB- Army -RRB- commands that without any relief, they would need to furlough to maintain their level of readiness,'' the general said. `` That furlough, in its worst case, -LRB- would be -RRB- as high as 150,000 people ... for varying lengths of time from three to 15 days.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said he is optimistic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will grant the flexibility to avoid furloughs because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is not asking for an extra appropriation. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must act by June, however, if the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is to avoid the huge furloughs that would be needed to help make up for a $ 2.8 billion cut to its original request of $ 21.3 billion for operations and maintenance spending this year. Roughly 70 percent of all the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s civilian workers are paid from that account, which also holds the money for readiness training for the active force, <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said.

 Once they could n't even give away the 50-year-old, art deco diner, but its proud new owner is hauling it 1,100 miles to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where such neon-lit, stainless steel roadside denizens are few. Inch by inch, a half-dozen workers are gingerly lifting the <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION> Diner from its foundation here and moving it onto a flat-bed trailer for its new home in <LOCATION> Decorah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` They're a vanishing piece of architecture,'' said owner <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON>, whose father used to hang out at the diner. `` To have the opportunity to try to save one is real gratifying.'' The 45-seat eatery, wrapped in stainless steel and topped with 2 -LCB- - foot-high neon letters spelling out `` DINER,'' is the victim of rapid development along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1, and has been closed for several years The property, owned by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based company Terranomics, includes the <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION> and is to be cleared for a shopping center <PERSON> Cori </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, Terranomics' development director, said the company tried to donate it to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Township </PERSON> to use as a concession stand on its athletic fields, but the township did n't want it. The company then tried to give it to <ORGANIZATION> Rider </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which also said no. `` We did n't want to see it torn down,'' she said. `` I'm very glad he's going to take it.'' <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON> would n't reveal the sales price, but said: `` It's worth it.'' He and his family grew up in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>. Following college in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he went to work for the railroad as a track laborer. <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON> said he was enthralled with the streamlined, art deco style of the dining cars that lent their form to the first diners of the 1920s and 1930s. He began collecting postcards of old luncheonettes. `` I guess the postcards were n't enough for me,'' said <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON>. As <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON> began to develop back trouble from his job, he began thinking about combining his interest in diners with his desire to open a restaurant. <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON> returned to the Northeast a few months ago to look for a diner to bring back to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. He spotted the <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>, which he remembered as a child. `` It used to be a hangout for my dad,'' he said. `` I do n't know at first if my wife was interested,'' said <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON>. `` People said, ` he's just talking about it.' All of a sudden, I have a contract in my hand.'' <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON>, 40, said the diner should be ready by Friday to be loaded onto the trailer for its two - to four-day trip to <LOCATION> Decorah </LOCATION>, where he lives with his wife and two children He's already conjuring up his menu once the diner gets settled into its new home: `` We'll have pork roll, fried mush, waffles, tomato gravy. ...'' Tomato gravy? `` It's something my grandmother used to make. Some evaporated milk, tomatoes, cooked up thick and poured over bread and butter. You have it in the morning and boy, is it good!'' `` I've always enjoyed cooking,'' he said. `` People tell me I'm a pretty good cook. I make a pretty good burger.'' He said it may take a couple of years to renovate the diner, and he wants it near an intersection of two state highways. `` The people in town are excited,'' said <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON>. `` The banker, the insurance man, they're excited.'' <PERSON> Durwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweet </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Decorah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said town officials are awaiting the diner's arrival. `` The loan committee was pretty impressed when I showed them a picture of it,'' said Tweet, adding that diners are rare in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` I think there's one in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and another in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>,'' he said. Surveying his diner, <PERSON> Tindall </PERSON> added: `` I'm really lucky to have found this.''

 Six gunmen who were caught robbing a bank on Wednesday killed four people and took 50 hostage, a witness said. Police surrounded the <ORGANIZATION> Banamex </ORGANIZATION> bank and were negotiating with the gunmen who said they would kill their hostages unless they received safe passage to an unidentified location, the witness, <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. The standoff began in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastal town at 12:45 p.m. -LRB- 3:45 p.m. EDT -RRB- when a bank alarm alerted police a robbery was in progress, said <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, the news editor at the <ORGANIZATION> Noroeste </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>. The gunmen wounded policeman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> when he entered the building and they disarmed and captured a second unidentifed policeman.

<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> says the agency must be given more independence, saying needed safety rules were bogged down in the bureaucracy during his tenure. Getting some regulations approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> was like `` a maddening shell and pea'' game <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee Wednesday. Some safety rules could be tied up for months because of the slowness of the department, he said. The answer is to remove the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> from the department, he said, as the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recommended Monday. `` Rules for a technical field such as aviation must be timely,'' he told lawmakers. `` Safety is often at issue and additional DOT requirements in the laborious rulemaking process can subvert the goal of safety from a timeliness as well as a technical accuracy standpoint.'' <PERSON> Engen </PERSON>'s comments clashed with <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, who told the same subcommittee last month that to get regulations out of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` it has been necessary to use the bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod.'' Although <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> has been critical before of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> proposals, he has not been as expansive, nor has he previously directly clashed with a department official. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials at the hearing Wednesday rejected <PERSON> Engen </PERSON>'s contentions, and gave reporters documents they said challenged some of the claims he made. <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> left his job July 2 for what he called personal reasons. Asked by a reporter whether his complaints to the subcommittee had prompted his departure, <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> said, `` You'll have to draw that conclusion, not me.'' The former administrator and DOT officials also sparred over events surrounding decisions <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> said he made. In one instance, <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> told the panel he blocked The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from removing two of the 10 emergency exits on its 747 jetliners to add extra seats. <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> said he rejected the manufacturer's request because it would have been less safe for passengers. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` was strangely silent'' while the matter was being decided. `` There was no waffling, no coziness between government and industry,'' he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> gave a reporter a copy of an Aug. 6, 1985, letter from then-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to Rep. <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, stating that `` at my request'' <PERSON> Engen </PERSON> was pursuing the issue. A June 10, 1985 letter to Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> from <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, expressed `` our disappointment and concern regarding Admiral <PERSON> Engen </PERSON>'s endorsement of the overwing emergency exit deactivation on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 aircraft.'' The letter asked Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to block <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> approval of the plan.

 Some congressmen are urging the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to have the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> extend its protection in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to randomly chosen ships not flying the American flag. `` The purpose is to keep any attacker off guard, off balance,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions of The Washington Post. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said such a policy would deter attacks because aggressors would not be sure if their actions might draw fire from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. No advance notice would be given of which ships would receive protection. Unidentified administration officials quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is considering the broadened role in the gulf following <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks this week on Iranian oil platforms that brought violent retaliation attempts from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy. Congressmen have expressed concern about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the gulf, where American warships protect Kuwaiti tankers flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., has suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could maintain a more neutral appearance in the Iran-Iraq war if the gulf were divided into zones, with each one protected by a different nation's navy The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies are doing more than is publicly perceived to help protect the flow of oil in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Five European nations and the Japanese have all increased their <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> efforts in the past 12 months to try to meet the threat posed by the Iran-Iraq war, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, a CRS analyst. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>'s assessment differed from the view of Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., who said the public believes the allies should do more in the troubled region <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panel on allied burden-sharing, which has been looking at help provided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel `` there has been substantial evolution of allied attitudes toward their military role in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'' in the past year. That change came after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. `` <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> sent additional naval contingents to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region to demonstrate that they appreciate the threat of instability in that region to Western interests,'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> noted.

<BYLINE>Air Force Makes Public First Drawing of `Flying Wing'
^By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted together without any fuselage in the center. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says that's the general shape of the new Stealth bomber. Piercing a decade of official secrecy, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday released an artist's drawing of its newest strategic bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later this fall. The service also acknowledged the program was suffering some cost overruns and that a new estimate would have to be released later this year. `` Some cost growth is to be expected in any development program that is on the leading edge of technology like the B-2,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said, using the bomber's official military designation. `` But the acquisition of the B-2 ensures our capability to effectively penetrate Soviet defenses well into the 21st century.'' The Stealth bomber is so named because it is designed to fly without showing up on radar. While the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has flatly refused to discuss the bomber since design work began in the 1970s, its general shape has actually been known since 1985 when former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> disclosed its resemblance to a `` flying wing.'' The drawing distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday shows an airplane that to some extent resembles a boomerang. A small cockpit rises in the middle on top and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side of the cockpit, also on top of the wing. The design allows the aircraft to be made without any sharp or right angles. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, the plane also relies on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and composite materials for construction. The design has long been the object of experimentation by the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is building the B-2 for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The company flew a propeller-driven version of such a plane, known as the XB-35, in 1946. A jet-powered version, the YB-49, first flew in late 1947 and was tested by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. But the service never purchased any of the planes, and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the early 1950s. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> declined Wednesday to give a precise date for the maiden flight, saying only that it would occur `` this fall'' and involve a short hop from the manufacturing plant at <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` As the first flight approaches, many actions associated with preparations for that flight can best be accomplished in the open, without compromising program security,'' the service said in explaining its relaxation of secrecy. Details of such things as performance characteristics, crew size and maximum payload remain classified, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Indeed, some of the details about the plane's design _ for example, the placement of the engine exhaust outlets _ have been deliberately masked in the artist's rendering, service sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did acknowledge, however, the plane is going to cost more than originally projected. `` While the acquisition of 132 B-2 bombers was originally estimated to cost $ 36.6 billion in 1981 dollars, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is re-evaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current and projected fiscal constraints,'' the service said. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, lauded the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for releasing more information about the plane, saying the public needs to learn about `` a revolutionary addition to our nuclear deterrent. He predicted the bomber `` will render obsolete billions of dollars of Soviet investment in their current air defense.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Call For `Aquafund' To Clean Up US Waters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of local environmental groups wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to create an `` Aquafund'' to clean up harbors and waterways that are toxic `` hot spots.'' A report released Wednesday by dozens of organizations from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said the program should be modeled on the government's `` Superfund'' program, which is designed to locate and clean up toxic waste sites on land. `` Our waterways can only be as clean as their container,'' the coalition said in the report issued to lawmakers. The Aquafund proposal and other recommendations came out of an October conference to set a national agenda for the clean up of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s bays, sounds and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON>, executive director of Save the Bay of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and head of the national conference. `` We're trying to tell you that our bays are worth protecting and fighting for,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> told a dozen lawmakers gathered at a conference to discuss the report. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s coastal waters are dying, and we need to take action now, or lose a critical economic resource,'' she said. `` We refuse to endure another summer of coastal horror stories, where dolphins and diseased fish and shellfish are pulled from our marine waters.'' Environmentalists called the October conference, sponsored in part by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the first of its kind for coastal activists and the report the first national coastal agenda. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said the problem of toxic sediments has become `` enormous.'' He said polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, found in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, and heavy metals in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and Puget Sound, have contaminated fish and limit public use. The proposed Aquafund would create a national priority list to identify the toxic `` hot spots'' and fund their clean up. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> now only regulates water quality, not the sediments on the floors of bays and waterways, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> did not put a price tag on the program, saying only it would be a `` multi-multi-million dollar project.'' The report also called for limiting or eliminating federal subsidies that environmentalists say encourage pollution. The group targeted the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, saying it promotes development of fragile coastal areas. The report also called for tougher environmental laws and more stringent enforcement, and a program to protect surviving wetlands and restore at least 10 percent of the wetlands already lost. `` Preventing the pollution of our coastal waters and cleaning up the damage that has already been done are ambitious but absolutely essential goals,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION> `` The recommendations put forth deserve widespread circulation and consideration.''

<HEAD>Students Rally Around AIDS Carrier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Junior high school students rallied around a student who has tested positive for the AIDS virus, shouting down a small group protesting his admission to the school. `` Go home!'' students yelled at the eight people protesting 12-year-old <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowery </PERSON>'s attendance at <ORGANIZATION> Clinton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Police twice had to separate the eight protesters from about 200 angry students and parents. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, whose son is a ninth-grader, slammed on her brakes and got out of her car to deride the protesters as `` disgusting.'' Members of the group `` do not know what they are talking about,'' she said. `` They are shaming the town. They are shaming this community. They are showing the whole world how ignorant they are. `` Ignorance and petty fear, that scares me more than AIDS,'' she said. <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON> was the center of protests last year when he tried to enter <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION>, an incident that led to his testimony before the presidential AIDS commission earlier this year in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. Health officials have said that <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON>, who has shown no symptoms of the syndrome, apparently contracted the virus from a clotting factor he uses in treatment for hemophilia. The substance is made from a blood component. The school's staff members, students and parents have attended special classes organized by the principal, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, to learn about AIDS and hemophilia, which is characterized by uncontrolled bleeding. The students `` are probably the most informed group of 7th-8th-and 9th-graders in the country on what this boy has, what it can do and how it can be transmitted,'' <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said. `` Our science teachers have done a fantastic job,'' he said. `` These kids are equipped with a lot of information.'' During lunch Tuesday, several students erected signs on the school grounds saying, `` <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON> is not hurting us. You are,'' `` Parents get educated,'' `` Innocence ca n't kill: ignorance can. Welcome to CJHS, <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON>,'' and `` Do n't be ignorant. Get the facts.'' Another sign said, `` Fight with facts. Rumors spread faster than AIDS.'' Near the end of the school day, students gathered to yell `` go home'' at the protesters. Last fall, <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON>'s parents pulled him out of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION> after they said they had received threats. After removing him, he had been taking classes alone at a special school. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. As of April 11, 33,060 people have died of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says he may appoint an acting deputy while the search continues for someone to fill the No. 2 slot in his embattled <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after two people have rejected the post. The position is being vacated Friday by Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who resigned in protest March 29 out of concern that the nearly year-long criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was hurting department operations. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s latest choice, former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, said Wednesday he was concerned with the `` personal and financial sacrifices'' required of him and his family for the brief appointment. `` My wife and I were not prepared for the pressures to which someone recommended for this position at this time would be subject,'' <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had hurriedly announced <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> would be his choice April 5 in a bid by the attorney general to assert his leadership at the department. Minutes after the announcement that <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> was withdrawing, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee he would appoint an acting deputy. He later told reporters he did not rule out the possibility of appointing his counselor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> three years ago refused to confirm <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> as associate attorney general, the No. 3 post in the department, because of <PERSON> Reynold </PERSON>'s handling of civil rights. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> later refined his remarks, with department spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> saying no decision has been made on whether to appoint an acting deputy and no thought given to who might fill the job in the interim if it were deemed necessary. The deputy attorney general manages day-to-day operations at the department and handles matters from which the attorney general has removed himself in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The No. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post also is vacant, with the departure of Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> to become a federal judge. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has chosen Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, but he wo n't join the department until he is nominated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That leaves Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> as the highest ranking official in the department after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The solicitor general represents the government before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' office, five of the six deputies are leaving and in <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>'s office, all but one of the deputies have left. Another key post that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is trying to fill is criminal division chief, left vacant by the March 29 protest resignation of Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who stepped down at the same time as <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. A number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys have rejected overtures by aides to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. Shepherd withdrew his name in the face of mounting publicity about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper. There were also disclosures that longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, now under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, had recommended Shepherd to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post in 1984 or 1985 and that <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> belongs to an all-white country club and an all-male social club. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that its investigation determined that the woman who alleged the affair, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, made up nearly every portion of her background. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> was <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s second choice to fill the post. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s overtures earlier this month, saying he had a heavy caseload at his law firm. Also on Wednesday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> reiterated there was no connection between a building lease signed by the department and the arrangement for a foundation to pay his wife's salary at the Multiple Sclerosis Society. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> signed a $ 50 million lease on the bulding owned in part by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> after his family's foundation routed money to the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s $ 40,000-a-year job. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> called the story an `` outrageous and scurrilous attack.'' He said an attempt to discredit him through his wife was `` the lowest form of journalism.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the Benders made a charitable contribution and did not pay Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON>, the society's attorney, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was hired only after the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> made available $ 40,000 for a development director for Operation Job Match, a program that finds positions for handicapped people. <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said MS officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to hire a development director for the job match program. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was the person MS officials wanted to fill the position, he said. `` Thereafter, the officers were able to make arrangements ... that the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> would fund the position for 1986 with a $ 40,000 grant and that Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would be hired as development director,'' he said. The MS society successfully solicited an additional $ 40,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to keep Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on the payroll in 1987. The society has a commitment from the foundation to pay $ 40,000 in 1988 for her salary, but the check has yet to be received, he said.

<HEAD>Study: Daily Stress Can Disrupt Ailing Hearts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A minor, everyday stress like public speaking can be as damaging to the heart as strenuous exercise in people who have cardiac disease, and even can trigger heart attacks, according to research published today. The researchers found that the common stresses can cause silent ischemia, a painless but ominous disruption in the flow of blood to the heart's own muscle. The study shows that `` previously unrecognized mental activities have very important consequences,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. It also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiac problem only for people with heart disease, not those those with healthy hearts. The chief author of the study recommended that people suspected of having heart disease _ those who smoke or have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or a family history of heart trouble _ should be checked for this condition so they can be treated. When silent ischemia is discovered during routine tests, people can be treated with medicines, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty, a common procedure that uses balloons to open up clogged heart arteries. `` Nothing should come out of this work about what patients should or should n't be doing in their daily lives,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozanski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I think people should exercise, and you ca n't go around worrying about mental stress.'' If ischemia lasts for more than 20 or 30 minutes, the oxygen-starved section of the heart dies, resulting in a heart attack. Although the crisis usually passes in a few minutes without permanent damage, it may be a warning of more serious heart problems to come. In their study, published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rozanski </PERSON> and colleagues studied 39 heart patients and 12 healthy people. While the men and women did a series of mildly stressful mental exercises, the doctors used a common diagnostic procedure called nuclear cardiology to watch their beating hearts. They found that a variety of mental gymnastics, such as repeatedly subtracting seven from a four-digit number, could trigger ischemia. The worst was asking people to give a five-minute talk about their personal faults and bad habits in front of two observers. `` It really brings home the notion that silent ischemia does n't just occur at extreme levels of exercise or in the highest risk patients,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` These are everyday patients who are doing quite well with coronary disease who, with minor levels of stress, are having significant amounts of ischemia.'' <PERSON> Rozanski </PERSON> noted that while the stress of hard exercise often caused pain, mental stress rarely did. `` Our study indicates a mechanism by which mental stress could induce ischemia, which if prolonged, could lead to heart attack,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selwyn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has reached similar conclusions. He equipped heart patients with portable electrocardiogram machines and matched their episodes of ischemia with what they were doing. Less than a quarter of them occurred during exercise. In an editorial in the journal, <PERSON> Selwyn </PERSON> said that the arteries of people with heart disease apparently fail to expand and contract properly in reaction to stress. When healthy people's hearts need more blood, their arteries open up to increase the flow. However, when the arteries are clogged with fatty desposits, the opposite seems to occur. They respond to physical or mental stress by squeezing tight.

<HEAD>Defendants Say Judge Makes `Mockery' of Their Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three defendants in the Iran-Contra case say the judge made `` a mockery'' of their rights by devising `` woefully inadequate'' procedures to determinine if prosecutors illegally used their congressional testimony. In an unusually harsh attack, defense attorneys challenged the procedures <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> adopted for a hearing on whether prosecutors took evidence from the compelled congressional testimony of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexer </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The lawyers asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to reconsider his denial of their requests to question individual grand jurors and witnesses to determine if independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation was tainted by exposure to the congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The procedure for next Monday's hearing `` makes a mockery of the orders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> compelling defendants' testimony'' before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the defense said in a brief filed Wednesday. Defense attorneys threatened to file an appeal. They also asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to postpone the hearing while he reconsiders how to conduct it. `` The procedures established by the order for determining whether or not there has been or will be any direct or indirect use of defendants' immunized testimony are woefully inadequate,'' the defense said. The three defendants are charged with conspiring to illegally divert to Nicaraguan rebels some of the profits from the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A fourth defendant, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, gave congressional testimony without the so-called `` use immunity.'' At a hearing last week, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected defense requests for a wide-ranging inquiry into <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigative methods and procedures. But the judge ordered <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to tell the court what steps he took to insulate his staff and the grand jury from the extensive publicity surrounding the defendants' testimony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also invited the defense, if it could, to produce a grand jury witness who changed his story after hearing congressional testimony. `` We think we can draw blood fairly quickly,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers, told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> at the hearing. The latest motion was filed a day before today's deadline for the defense to give <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> the name of the witness it plans to call at next Monday's proceeding. Lawyers for the three defendants contend that publicity of last year's congressional hearings made it impossible for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to shield his staff and grand jurors from the testimony, some of which was given under the condition that it could not be used against them in criminal prosecution. `` Certainly common sense tells us that there is vitually no prospective witness in this case who has not been exposed to, and to some degree influenced, by defendants' immunized testimony,'' the joint defense motion said. `` This case is an omelet from which the tainted immunized testimony can never be unscrambled,'' attorneys <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> and <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said in the motion. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has said he would dismiss the case if <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> fails to prove he did n't use evidence from the defendants' congressional testimony. But the defense said the judge's methods for making that finding `` appear designed to ensure that any dismissal of the indictment will only follow a protracted trial with its grave risks to our national security and its inherent financial and emotional trauma both for the defendants and for the nation.'' The judge has indicated he would like to start the trial in July, while the defense wants to delay the proceeding until next year.

 For more than a decade, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has played a central role in mediating hostage crises. On Wednesday, it achieved another success, negotiating a peaceful end to the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. Neither <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> provided any details of the deal that ended the hijacking, setting free the 31 remaining hostages. But some evidence indicates the outlines of the deal that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s official news agency said assured the nine hijackers safe passage to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> may have been worked out in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> more than a week ago. Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON>, asked about the fate of the hijackers, replied, `` That is strictly <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s affair.'' The hijackers had demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed for the 1983 bombings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> steadfastly refused. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> was criticized for striking deals in the 1970s. The world media dubbed the nation a `` sanctuary for hijackers,'' and for a while it adopted a policy of not accepting hijacked planes. But in 1981, the North African nation gained prestige for mediating the release of the American hostages held in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> also was involved in negotiations that led to the end of the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner with 145 people aboard. The hijackers had killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver. The non-aligned nation is a strong believer in secret negotiations and in mediations it adheres to another country's wishes to the letter <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON> declined to disclose any details of the bargaining in the Kuwaiti hijacking, which began April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Before the plane landed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on April 13, Cypriot officials told reporters it was allowed to take off only because <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had given formal assurance all the hostages would be released. The hijackers had killed two passengers in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> promptly denied the claim, apparently to avoid arousing the suspicion of the hijackers in delicate maneuvering at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport. Aided by the revolutionary credentials it gained in its bitter eight-year war of independence with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is well placed among Moslem countries in mediating between moderate governments and fundamentalist Islamic extremists. In this case, it set up a top-level negotiating committee, personally supervised by <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON> and divided into two teams, one for contacts with the Kuwaitis and the other for liaison with the gunmen. Algerian officials shuttled seemingly unperturbed between the two sides. <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON> himself was the first Algerian to board the plane on April 13. After talking to the hijackers for 30 minutes, he announced they had promised to `` refrain from all violence while on Algerian territory.'' Various Algerian negotiators went to and from the plane day and night for six days. Several times, hooded hijackers climbed down from the plane to talk to Algerian negotiators in a Soviet-built, yellow, Niva hatchback car. When the hijackers had something new to say, they would call on the jet's radio, `` Yellow car, please.'' When the Algerians wanted to talk to the hijackers or send them a message, they would ask, `` Can the yellow car come to the plane, please?'' Extreme politeness was observed in all these exchanges. There was never any discussion of substantive issues since conversations with the control tower were monitored by reporters. The yellow car was the negotiating vehicle. When the hostages finally emerged from the plane at 6 a.m. Wednesday, the hijackers were gone.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students shouted `` Tiger bait! Tiger, bait!'' at a man who for nearly five hours occupied the outer cage of <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 500-pound <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger mascot before he surrendered. The intruder, <PERSON> Moacyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON>, a 49-year-old native of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> two years, merely wanted a job, authorities said. He seized the keys of the cage from a student trainer Wednesday evening and then demanded in broken English and Portuguese to speak with <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> basketball coach <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said university spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>. Marksmen stood by with tranquilizer guns in case the tiger got loose. A police SWAT team also stood by. At one point, some of the hundreds of students who came to watch chanted: `` Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry used at <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> sporting events when opposing teams enter. <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> surrendered after talking with <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s center who is from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. `` He's upset, man. He's going to be all right,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> surrendered. <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> was booked on first-degree robbery, criminal mischief and criminal trespassing, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Phares </PERSON>. No bond was set immediately. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> served for the past two semesters as a proctor who was given room and board in <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s athletic dormitory in return for his services as an unpaid supervisor. `` He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporary visa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>. Although authorities said they feared he had a pistol and heard him say he had a bomb, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said no weapons or bomb were found when the standoff ended. Cezar himself was never in danger from the tiger, a 13-year-old named <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> who paced restlessly behind him. And though he threatened to free the tiger, <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> did n't leave the barred outer cage that surrounds the main cage where the big cat actually lives. At one point, negotiators passed a document between the cage's bars to Cezar <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said it was an application for employment. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, was told of the incident but had no immediate plans to return, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Vonnie </PERSON>, and some of <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s Spanish-speaking basketball players were among those who talked with <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons during fighting that ended the 26-month Iranian occupation of the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also began mobilizing its forces to confront the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took a drubbing this week, losing the peninsula and having six vessels sunk or crippled in clashes with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired missiles at four Iranian cities on Wednesday, then offered to stop its missile attacks at midnight if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did the same. The unofficial truce apparently held on both sides through the early morning hours today. Before the truce began, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired a missile at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> that reportedly exploded near a U.S.-run oilfield. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis and captured more than 250 others in the Shemiran mountain region of <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` All bases and resistance centers throughout the country are in a complete state of alert,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Wednesday. `` Today our revolution and our heroic nation is faced with the onslaught of the evil triangle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the reactionaries,'' it added. The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, instructed volunteers to report to bases throughout the country `` and get ready for departure'' to the battlefront. It did not mention numbers, but Iranian leaders have claimed up to 5 million people were trained in the last six months. At <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used `` cyanide, nerve and mustard gases'' on a `` large scale'' during the battle in the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>. In a letter to the council released Wednesday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, said the gases affected `` areas as far as <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>,'' an Iranian city 40 miles north of the refinery oil town of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> at the peninsula's southern tip. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Iraqi officials on Wednesday took reporters on a tour of the 35-square-mile triangle of the peninsula that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> captured in February 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrawi </PERSON> said he saw Iranian storage depots containing ammunition and rations left intact, suggesting a speedy Iranian retreat in the 36-hour battle that ended Monday. It was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s biggest offensive in its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed its forces were attacking Iranian pockets of resistance after most Iranian forces were driven back across the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said thousands of Iranians were killed or wounded in the battle. In the southern gulf, the USS Jack <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> went on alert on Wednesday after an Iranian C-130 aircraft ignored a warning as it approached the missile frigate. `` We are an Iranian warplane, doing our duty,'' the pilot responded. Minutes after the plane landed at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s nearby <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the frigate went to `` general quarters,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s highest alert. Officers said the alert was a precaution against the possibility that the aircraft could have dropped a canister of CS riot control gas in the area. There was no indication the plane had taken any such action. Previously, the ship received brief reports of Iranian speedboats attacking merchant shipping in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the narrow entry to the gulf at its southern end, and the discovery of two mines further north. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would stop bombarding Iranian cities beginning at midnight -LRB- 4 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB- as long as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did the same. There was no immediate response from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Hundreds have been killed since Feb. 29, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> resumed firing missiles at each other's cities. After the announcement but before midnight, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, Shiraz and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported a strike on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and said civilians were killed. The <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> insurers doubled their rates on ships traveling to the gulf after Monday's U.S.-Iran clashes. The premium for a two-week voyage to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> doubled on Tuesday to 2 percent, or about $ 200,000 on a $ 10 million hull, said a <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed two Iranian oil platforms, sank an Iranian patrol boat, crippled two frigates and damaged three other attack boats on Monday. It was the worst U.S.-Iran clash since the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buildup last July to curb Iranian attacks on shipping in the gulf. Iranian TV showed a ceremony in the gulf port of <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION>, where military officials lauded the bravery of the crew of the patrol boat Joshan, which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said 15 of the <PERSON> Joshan </PERSON>'s crew were killed and 29 wounded `` We are always prepared to deliver strong blows to the enemies of Islam,'' said the vessel's skipper, identified only as Capt. <PERSON> Maleki </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war effort, reported an Iranian missile crashed in its territory on Wednesday but mentioned no casualties. A source in the gulf, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the missile fell in the desert area of <LOCATION> Wafra </LOCATION> near an oilfield operated by <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. Americans and Kuwaitis work there.

<HEAD>Destroying Fetuses in Some Pregnancies Saves Babies, Raises

<TEXT>
 Doctors believe they can ultimately save babies' lives by selectively destroying some fetuses while sparing others in the same womb, but one ethics expert calls it `` a tragic practice. The procedure has been performed in women who are pregnant with several fetuses, often as a result of fertility drugs or test-tube fertilizations. The chances are slim that four or more fetuses would survive and be healthy. So the strategy is to terminate all but two of them in a procedure called `` selective reduction.'' The two remaining fetuses face reasonably good odds of growing to be healthy, normal infants. `` In patients who choose to undergo selective reduction during the first trimester, the procedure may offer an option to save the lives of a number of desperately wanted infants,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Their report, published in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, describes the use of the procedure in 12 pregnancies. Seven of the women had healthy twins, while one had a healthy single baby. Four others had no live-born infants. They also acknowledged, however, that selective reduction raises important ethical questions. Others agreed. In an editorial in the journal, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbins </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said that even those who think abortion is sometimes justified `` must wrestle with the concept of sacrificing some fetuses so that others can survive.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who teaches moral theology at Notre Dame, said in an interview that `` in the vast majority of cases, that is morally wrong.'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said the procedure is morally acceptable only after accidents, such as inadvertant overdoses of fertility drugs, that result in so many fetuses that none is likely to survive. `` A case can be made for doing it when it's the only life-saving alternative available,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. `` Even then, everybody feels chilly about it.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, a medical ethics expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a tragic practice'' and `` a very sad intervention.'' Doctors who perform test-tube fertilizations often implant several embryos in hopes that one will survive, but sometimes more may grow. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said doctors who perform these fertilizations should implant no more than four embryos so that they minimize the risk of multiple fetuses, and physicians also should be careful to prescribe the minimum effective dose of fertility drugs. `` Once you are stuck in a situation, it's morally defensible to do it,'' he said of selective reduction. `` But you should do everything you can to avoid that situation.'' In his report, <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> noted that in the past, couples have had only two choices: take their chances on a successful outcome or abort the entire pregnancy. However, he said the decision to have selective reduction is also hard for parents anxious to have babies. It should only be done if they are prepared to lose the entire pregnancy. In the 12 cases described, the doctors selectively destroyed all but two fetuses in each woman. In most cases, this was done by injecting potassium chloride into the fetal hearts. Of those who received the procedure, two of the women had each conceived six fetuses, one had five, five had four and four were carrying triplets. <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> said that women who carry four or more fetuses are ideal candidates for the approach because of the high risk of complications. However, triplets `` are in a gray area and present an enormous dilemma for both the patients and their physicians.'' He said it should not be done with twins, since chances are good that both will develop to be healthy babies.

<TEXT>
 Come November, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> might not abide by its handshake agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to project a winner in the presidential election until all polls have closed. NBC News President <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said Wednesday he is `` uncomfortable'' with the agreement, which was elicited by sponsors of legislation to establish a nationwide uniform poll closing time. `` We're very concerned about it and we'll re-evaluate it before the election in November if there's no progress made -LRB- on the poll closing bill -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision could put pressure on the two other networks to abandon the policy, stated in an informal agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as part of a push for a uniform national poll closing time. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is abiding by the policy, although `` NBC Nightly News'' anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> said Tuesday night during coverage of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary almost two hours before polls closed that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` may well be headed for victory.'' `` Nightly News'' has been making similar statements about trends in races throughout the primary season. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and CBS' Dan Rather both said Tuesday night during their broadcasts that they could not predict the election because polls were still open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The polls closed at 9 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s report followed a local <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> newscast predicting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the winner statewide and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as carrying <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> insisted the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> report did not violate the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because it was n't technically a `` projection.'' In a 1985 letter to Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, like his counterparts at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, vowed <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would `` not use the exit poll data we gather to suggest the probable winner in any state until polls in that state have closed. The letter was part of an agreement sought by <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., to help their legislation proposing a uniform poll closing time in presidential election years <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday evening report for not being true to the `` spirit'' of network policy. `` However, one might argue the letter of it,'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said in a statement. He praised <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS for explicitly stating that they would not make a prediction until the polls closed. `` It is my hope that this is just an error and that NBC News will reaffirm its policy and that the other news operations will not see this incident as cause to abandon their policy or practice,'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said. `` It's a very frustrating situation,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bettag </PERSON>, executive producer of the `` CBS Evening News.'' `` I think somebody's got to seriously rethink how this all works. It is very frustrating to be in the position we were in last night, knowing that your opposition has for weeks been characterizing elections. It's a very uncomfortable position to be in.'' By the time the networks go on the air, they usually have exit polling data upon which they could accurately predict the outcome of the election. Release of such information theoretically disenfranchises voters still waiting to cast votes. In a presidential election, polls in Western states are still open after polls on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> have closed. Ironically, it was not the networks but then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> who sparked the most controversy when in 1980, he conceded the presidential election to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before polls on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> had closed.

 The dollar finished higher Thursday against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while stock prices lost slightly. The dollar ended the day at 124.30 yen, up 0.40 yen from its close of 123.90 yen Wednesday. It had opened the day at 124.27 yen and fluctuated in narrow range of 124.20 yen to 124.36 yen. `` The dollar is somewhat strengthened following overnight dollar-purchasings in overseas markets and the selling of European currencies,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent during March had no major impact on the currency market. `` The worsening figures were what many expected,'' the dealer said.

He said trading was thin as institutional investors stayed out of the market.

 Jubilant Iraqi soldiers chanted slogans and waved their rifles before a mural of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to celebrate the recapture of this shell-blasted town at <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern tip. <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> lay battered and virtually unpopulated around them, its walls still marked with murals of Iranian leaders and slogans in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> tongue. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s seizure this week of the dusty, windswept town, two years after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> captured it, was probably <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s most important offensive victory since the war began in September 1980. By the time reporters visited Wednesday evening, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces who had stormed the desolate battleground on Sunday appeared to have driven Iranian troops back across the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway that divides the warring nations. Soldiers in green Iraqi uniforms made tea at a leisurely pace in front of former Iranian bunkers 100 yards from the Shatt on the edge of Faw. In the distance, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> gunners periodically fired shells across the broad river, and Iranians answered with occasional shelling of their own. Nearly every building in the town was partly crumbled by shelling, and giant oil storage tanks nearby were melted and twisted by fire. Although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reportedly once had 50,000 soldiers in the Faw region, controlling the southern 8 to 12 miles of the peninsula, reporters on Wednesday saw no Iranian bodies and only moderate numbers of freshly destroyed weaponry. The sides of roads leading from <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> were littered with twisted tanks and mangled trucks. Much of the wreckage, however, was rusted or half buried by the choking dust, remnants of the massive 1986 battles. Iraqi officials provided no briefing on the battle or the casualties suffered by the two sides. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> previously has said that thousands of Iranians were killed or wounded in the battle. The battlefield itself was a vast and flat drained marshland, churned and diked by defense works ranging from foxholes to massive earthen barriers. As cars, trucks and tanks struggled through huge clouds of powdery dust blown up from the field on one side of the road, shallow marshes sprouting reeds appeared on the other. At <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used `` cyanide, nerve and mustard gases'' on a `` large scale'' during the battle in the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>. In a letter to the council released Wednesday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, said the gases affected `` areas as far as <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>,'' an Iranian city 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION>. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrawi </PERSON> said hundreds of Iranian prisoners were shown to a group of journalists that was the first to reach the peninsula after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been driven out.

<HEAD>Booster Shots Prolong Effect of Experimental AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A researcher who gave himself an experimental AIDS vaccine still showed immune system defenses against the AIDS virus a year later, thanks to booster treatments, scientists reported today. But the booster procedure must be simplified before it could be used in large-scale tests to see if the vaccine can actually prevent AIDS virus infection, they said. `` We are in the process of finding an easier way,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Marie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Curie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, who made headlines in March 1987 by reporting that he and some volunteers had been given the vaccine. It was the first reported human test of a vaccine against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There have been no side effects, he said. The vaccine was essentially a vaccinia virus genetically modified to produce an AIDS virus protein called gp160. The idea was that the immune system would react to the protein, raising defenses that also might fight the AIDS virus. In last year's report, <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON> and co-authors said the vaccine made his immune system produce two kinds of defenses: proteins called antibodies and special blood cells. Evidence of defenses appeared up to 370 days after the initial vaccination, he and his colleagues wrote in today's British journal Nature. But there is no proof that the Zagury could have resisted infection by the AIDS virus, he and 16 scientists from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, wrote. <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON> received three booster treatments. About three months after the vaccination, blood cells were drawn from him and infected with more modified vaccinia virus. Then the cells were re-injected through a slow-drip intravenous line, a process that took about 3 -LCB- hours, <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The second and third boosters were injections of the AIDS virus protein, given 299 days and 350 days after the initial vaccine. Two unvaccinated volunteers who received only the protein shots showed no immune system response. <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON> showed antibodies against the AIDS virus protein 13 days after the first booster, a reaction lasting three months. Nine days after second treatment, more antibodies against the AIDS virus protein and against a viral protein made from it, called gp120, appeared. Those levels rose after the third booster. Tests at various times showed that under certain conditions, immune system factors in Zagury's blood inhibited two dissimilar strains of the AIDS virus from infecting cells in the test tube. Each booster treatment also markedly increased the ability of <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON>'s immune system cells to proliferate when exposed to either strain in the test tube. In addition, his immune system cells could destroy virus-infected cells for a time after each booster treatment. In another test, doses of AIDS virus protein were injected just under the surface of <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON>'s skin before the second booster and 20 days after the third. His immune system reacted each time, showing it was still primed. The process of removing, treating and re-injecting immune system cells would be too cumbersome to use in a large-scale experiment, as would be required to test the vaccine's effectiveness, <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, an American AIDS vaccine expert, said the fact that <PERSON> Zagury </PERSON>'s immune system acted against quite different strains of the AIDS virus is significant. Many previous studies suggested that a vaccine using one strain might not work against other strains of the highly variable AIDS virus, said <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, chief of the laboratory of viral diseases at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases.

<TEXT>
 In a state where thousands of empty miles promise little more than highway hypnosis, and today's culinary special may be a bowl of truck-stop chili, relief is in sight for the culturally bereft. A new guidebook takes some of the mystery out of the seemingly endless ribbons of roadway in the Lone Star state by detailing motels, restaurants, gas stations, convenience stores and bank machines at every <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> freeway exit. `` Just gathering the information was a monumental effort,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cima </PERSON>, who probed the delights of 2,400 exits during a four-month, 7,000-mile jaunt to assemble `` Sunset Highway Services Directory, Exit-By-Exit.'' His Baedeker of the beaten track is a must, for example, at exit 761-761A in west <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where finicky tourists must decide whether they want to get gas at the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> or Exxon stations. Hungry motorists can eat at Platters or Steak & amp; Ale or perhaps pick up something at the 24-hour Stop N Go. <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> bank also is at the exit. The 288-page soft-cover book also includes <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Cima </PERSON> and his wife eventually want to write a 10-book series covering the entire country. But mostly, except for about 50 pages, the guide concerns <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Cima </PERSON> said `` has its own character and personality.'' Shortly after drivers reach Exit 0 at the <LOCATION> Texas-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> border, he points out, there's an anti-littering sign: `` Do n't Mess with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' `` That says it all,'' <PERSON> Cima </PERSON> said. `` It's very clear when you enter <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, you've entered the Lone Star State.'' The Cimas' inaugural effort two years ago was a similar book about <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cima </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Saundra </PERSON>, an airline flight attendant, came up with the idea after repeatedly driving home to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and worrying about where to pull off the freeway if her car broke down. <PERSON> Cima </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> test pilot, cruised every <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> freeway and many other highways with three other drivers, getting off at each exit to make note of the services available to motorists. `` That was the only way to get complete information,'' <PERSON> Cima </PERSON> said recently from his base in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Besides restaurants, motels and service stations, the listings include shopping centers, hospitals and police stations. A second driver later retraced most of the routes to verify the information. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> really seemed like a pretty good idea,'' he said. `` With all the RV -LRB- recreational vehicle -RRB- traffic and all the people coming to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from the North, it seemed like a logical extension of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' `` As it turns out, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has more exits than <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had 2,800.

 A district attorney has been asked to bring charges against a television reporter who registered five times for this week's primary election to underscore the potential for fraud. In a report broadcast Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> told how she registered to vote in the city boroughs of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and in suburban <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, using similar names and friends' addresses. Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> said she got three voter registration cards and was admitted to vote at five polling places Tuesday, although the report stressed she voted only once. On Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON>, executive director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, who conceded that the computer registration process may need to be updated. After the reporter left, Mrs. <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON> contacted District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON> and asked him to prosecute the reporter for felony violations of the election law. It is illegal to give false information to election officials or to obtain a false registration. `` What she did is against the law,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON> said. `` She is admitting on television that she committed two Class-E felonies.'' <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Montealegre </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON>, confirmed that he spoke with Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, but said no investigation had been started. She said he had no further comment. The report did not suggest that widespread fraud had been committed in Tuesday's primary, but stressed that an organized campaign to rig a local election might work. Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> admitted she broke the law, but said it was the only way to test the potential for fraud. Mrs. <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON> claimed that fraudulent registration was rare, but breaking the law on television would encourage others to do it. `` I told her, ` If you go on television, people who have never thought about doing something like this will think about doing so.' I think she's really out of line,'' she said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Restore Michigan Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has decided to reinstate a presidential primary to replace the caucuses used in 1984 and this year to distribute delegates to the Democratic and Republica national conventions. The bill, which had been the subject of several months of delicate bipartisan negotiations, passed overwhelmingly in a 32-5 vote on Wednesday and was sent to the House. The legislation, which is expected to pass in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would restore the closed primary for the 1992 presidential elections, requiring voters to declare their party preference 30 days before the election. `` A closed primary is better than no primary at all,'' declared Sen. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Posthumus </PERSON>, R-Alto, the bill's sponsor. Sen. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlers </PERSON>, R-Grand Rapids, compared the bill to this year's caucus system and said: `` It's much better to have the direct participation of the people.'' But `` It's going to reduce dramatically the number of people who will vote in that primary,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, D-Flint. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> launched its latest presidential primary to allocate delegates to the national presidential conventions among the various White House hopefuls in 1972. Democrats quit using the primary after 1976 because their national rules prohibited open primaries, and the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> dropped it after 1980. The primary has been estimated to cost the state about $ 5.2 million.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 70-year-old alderwoman credited with helping catch a shooting suspect says she has been patrolling her crime-ridden, economically depressed ward since she was assigned a bodyguard earlier this year. Before the bodyguard, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said, she jumped into the middle of sticky situations on her own. `` I have a desire to see my ward free of crime, and if they know somebody out there is watching them and working with the police, it may be a deterrent,'' Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said Wednesday. Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said she and her bodyguard, police officer <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, decided to end an evening of cruising for crime Tuesday when they heard over a police scanner that someone had been shot. When they arrived at the scene, the victim _ who had been shot four times in a squabble over a girlfriend _ already had been taken to the hospital, Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said. The suspect had fled, but a few women were standing around `` screaming and crying,'' <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said. `` She -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> -RRB- was the one who calmed the women down in order for us to get a description of the offender and the direction of his flight,'' <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> also persuaded the women to tell police the name and address of the suspect, <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said he and a detective found the suspect, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in a closet of the apartment the women had directed them to. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was arrested and has been charged with attempted murder, police said. `` If the alderwoman had n't been on the scene, the offender could very well still be at large,'' <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said. `` Intervening in street incidents ... is something I've always done,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, a retired criminal lawyer. Ms. <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said she was assigned a bodyguard because of recent threats on her life. `` But we've turned out to be a crime fighting team.

 The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen today, recovering most of its losses from the day before, while stock prices slipped back slightly. The dollar closed at 124.30 yen, up 0.40 yen from its close of 123.90 yen Wednesday, when it lost 0.47 yen. It had opened the day at 124.27 yen and fluctuated in a narrow range between 124.20 yen and 124.36 yen. `` Trading was quiet without particular incentives to stimulate the market,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Except for transactions of light amounts by some trading houses, most investors sidestepped the market, partly because of possible intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> does not officialy comment on its market activities.

Traders said investors, already inclined to stay on the sidelines as the holiday season approaches, were even more cautious because of developments in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond and stock markets. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market will be closed on April 29, and May 3-5 for national holidays. Other than some activity in speculative issues, trading was lackluster, the traders said.

<HEAD>Roh Vows To Crackdown On Election-Related Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo today said he would not tolerate more violence in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> campaign. The opposition called for more protests, claiming the government sought to rig the elections. Police, meanwhile, today released about 30 governing party supporters who were held hostage by opposition party supporters in a city south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after a dispute over campaign literature. On Wednesday, about 30 people were injured in scattered violence related to the election. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> today said his governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must retain its majority in the assembly in Tuesday's elections to ensure national stability and the introduction of full democracy. `` Whoever violates the law and destroys <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> order must be punished severely in the name of the people,'' he said in a nationally televised news conference. Opposition leaders charged the government was conspiring to rig the elections. They warned they would call for a repeat of the nationwide violence that hit the nation last June if the elections are rigged. `` The ruling party will face popular resistance and disobedience if its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. Rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said he would be forced to make a `` grave decision'' if the government cheated: `` The <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime should not forget the lesson from the June struggle.'' All political parties have been wooing voters with money, meals and free day trips in frenzied races for assembly seats. But there has been no sign so far of government election rigging. Police secured the release early today of about 30 governing party supporters who were held hostage by the <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s party in <LOCATION> Youngam </LOCATION>, 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police said they promised to investigate a clash between the two groups. The opposition supporters seized the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> members after a quarrel over distributing campaign leaflets and held them in a Peace and Democracy party office that was surrounded by 600 riot police. The hostages were tied up and smeared with red paint. Angry opposition supporters later marched on a police station after police arrested some Peace and Democracy party members involved in the incident. Riot police broke up the protest with volleys of tear gas and arrested seven people. At least 33 people were injured Wednesday in scattered clashes between government and opposition supporters in the cities of <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jungju </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> appealed for orderly elections and accused the opposition of fomenting unrest. He said his party must keep control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> if it is to govern effectively. `` It is my desire to see the ruling party win a majority of seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in order for me to effectively run the government,'' he said. The government may have trouble retaining its majority in the assembly because of public reluctance to accept the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> took office in February after winning a five-year presidential term with 33.6 percent of the vote in December after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, an ex-general who helped put former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> in power with military backing in 1980, has attempted to cut his ties to the authoritarian government he replaced. He repeated his promise today to ensure full democracy. The opposition, which was discredited by its internal divisions during the presidential election, is struggling to stage a comeback. It has claimed the government won the presidential election by fraud, but failed to provide evidence. Opposition leaders have attacked the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government with charges of corruption after former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s brother was arrested in March on charges of embezzling millions of dollars. The opposition also claims <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> will continue military-backed rule. But the two main opposition parties failed to reunite for the elections and are again fighting for opposition votes. Both are determined to emerge as the main opposition force. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who promised to root out corruption under the <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> regime, today said he would keep his promise to end any official abuse of power and ensure a `` clean government.''

<HEAD>Rare Chicks Hatched In Captivity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two chicks of a bird species found only on an island off <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have been hatched here, wildlife authorities said. The chicks _ <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> kestrels _ were displayed Wednesday at The World Center for Birds of Prey south of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. One was hatched Tuesday and the other on April 13, are the first kestrels to be hatched in captivity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said. `` This is a real accomplishment,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, director of the center. He said the birds exist only on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. The birds were on the verge of extinction when the Boise-based Peregrine Fund began studying the species in 1973. Through captive breeding in <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, the population has grown to more than 70 birds. In <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, destruction of the forests in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION> resulted in reduction of the kestrel's favorite food, a tree-dwelling lizard. It also is located in the middle of a cyclone belt. Kestrel experts like <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heck </PERSON>, who is raising the newborns, said one key to the their survival may lie in forcing them to live on other islands and to eat a wider variety of food. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, Heck is using forceps to feed the chicks quail that is ground up like hamburger. The chicks have an excellent chance of survival, he said. Heck hopes to release the kestrels in <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> next fall. They weigh less than an ounce now, and will weigh about half a pound when fully grown. The Peregrine Fund is a non-profit organization founded in 1970. Known best for its pioneering work in preventing the extinction of <ORGANIZATION> Peregrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> falcons </ORGANIZATION>, the center has expanded its focus to preserving raptors worldwide.

A White House spokesman announced Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had ended its search for <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, and Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>. The two offically were declared missing. The news came little more than a day after the families of both men learned they had failed to return from a night patrol mission in the gulf. The two Marines, stationed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, were aboard an AH-1 Cobra helicopter Monday and were to have returned to the guided missile cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> following the flight. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims it shot down the helicopter down, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> denies that. `` We do n't blame anyone for calling off the search,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said Wednesday afternoon, as tears welled in his eyes. `` We knew they could n't keep nine ships out there endlessly. `` But we do n't know how people are supposed to get through times like these. At times we're OK. At other times, we feel like the end of the world has come. `` We're just holding on to faith that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> -LRB- Hill -RRB- will be home soon,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lora </PERSON>, said. `` We love him and we want him to come home. But sometimes we do n't always get what we want.'' A member of the <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> family, meanwhile, was feeling a mixture of sorrow and pride. `` He told the family if he ever got lost or did n't come back to remember that he was doing what he wanted to do, and to hold on to that thought,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s younger sister, 24-year-old <PERSON> Kris </PERSON>. `` The waiting has been the worst part. ... We are a close-knit family and we are banding together,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, live in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and the couple is expecting its first child, Ms. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said. `` We're very numb right now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said.

 The toughest battlefield in the war on AIDS will be <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but the last skirmishes may be fought in the back alleys where drug addicts congregate, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> says. `` A health problem is never just a medical problem,'' Dr. <PERSON> Halfdan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, director-general of <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` AIDS is just as much a political problem. It's a social problem. It's an economic problem.'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, a craggy-featured <PERSON> Dane </PERSON>, speaks of fighting disease with a missionary zeal. He says he refuses to be daunted by the challenge of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` If you get overwhelmed, then you lose your imagination,'' he said during a visit to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters this week. The Geneva-based WHO estimates there are about 150,000 cases of AIDS worldwide and an additional 5 million to 10 million people infected with the AIDS virus. It says 129 countries have reported the disease. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> said AIDS is spreading fast in urban <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, a region where economic problems have made even the fight against curable diseases difficult. `` Africa has been more underprivileged and more overtraumatized by history than any other place,'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> said. `` Obviously it is a continent where development has gone wrong. But I take AIDS as a challenge in this difficult situation.'' There is no known cure or vaccine for AIDS, a viral disease that destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is spread through sexual contact, tainted blood, sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers, or passed on by infected mothers to their children at or before birth. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> praised the efforts of sub-Saharan nations to develop national programs against AIDS with the help of WHO. `` We have truely been able to set in motion programs that, I believe, in spite of the absence of vaccines and drugs, will bear fruit over the next four, five, six years,'' he said. Intravenous drug abusers, however, may prove to be the most intractable problem, he said, partly because they tend to be self-destructive and are less likely to take the kinds of precautions that can stem AIDS. Compounding the problem is the worldwide failure to curb drug use, he said. `` We have been doing very badly with the IV drug users,'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> said his attitude toward AIDS has changed dramatically. `` I had not realized in the first few years that it had the explosive potential that it has,'' he acknowledged. Two years ago he was criticized for saying AIDS was getting undue attention in comparison to the millions of children who die every year of curable or preventable diseases like malaria, measles, whooping cough or simple diarrhea. Now <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> says he regards AIDS as the most serious health problem confronting the world. He said that in the past year WHO has intensified its efforts against the disease, trying to coordinate a global strategy to check AIDS. `` We know it is exploding in many parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We know it is exploding in many parts of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and Latin American countries. We know that it is also starting to explode among certain IV drug users in certain <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries,'' he said. `` It makes you very nervous.''

<HEAD>Preliminary Test Results Show Tumors In Mice, EPA Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says preliminary results from new tests show that a controversial chemical used to regulate the growth of apples does cause tumors in mice. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, in an Arpil 8 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency does not yet have enough information to make a decision on what to do. However <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in the letter, obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, that a decision could be announced as early as fall on whether to ban use of the chemical. The chemical, daminozide had been used on about 40 percent of the nation's apple crop. Applied in the summer, it slows growth, makes apples ripen together, deepens color and lengthens storage life. The agency began studying daminozide in 1980 and proposed to ban it in 1985, but decided to order new studies when its own scientific advisers said it had not proved its case. It did lower the permissible residues in apples and the amount that may be used in orchards. `` I hope that it is clear from the information provided in this letter that we do not yet have enough information'' to decide what to do about daminozide, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which manufactures daminozide has told apple growers it remains confident that the chemical, sold under the trade name Alar, eventually will be cleared.

 Grocery shoppers will be able to get rainchecks or substitutes from their supermarkets on advertised items, under a new <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rule. Although those are common practices of many businesses, they have technically been illegal for supermarkets a under rule adopted in 1971.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of police today surrounded a bank in northwestern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> where six gunmen held more than 40 customers and employees captive after four hostages were killed and about 10 wounded. The gunmen, who were caught robbing the bank Wednesday, threatened to kill their hostages unless they allowed to travel to a nearby airport and leave on a plane, said <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state governor. Authorities gave conflicting accounts about how the casualties occurred. One official said they occurred in a shootout with police. Another said the gunmen shot the hostages inside the bank. The standoff in this coastal Gulf of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> city of 120,000 began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday -LRB- 3:45 p.m. EDT -RRB- after the gunmen burst into the <ORGANIZATION> Banamex </ORGANIZATION> bank and an alarm alerted police to the robbery, said <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, news editor at the <ORGANIZATION> Noroeste </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in the state capital of <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>. One of two police officers inside conducting business, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, tried to prevent the robbery and was shot, <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said. The other officer apparently was disarmed by the robbers, the spokesman said. The gunmen then attempted to leave the surrounded bank, using <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> and at least one customer as a shield, said <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, who was on the scene. The customer, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>, was killed and <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> received more wounds when the escape attempt led to a gun battle between police and the robbers in which `` nine or 10'' hostages were wounded, according to <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>. It was not clear if the wounded were still among the hostages, he said. <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> died at a hospital after the gunmen allowed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials to escort him from the building, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. The other two people killed were identified as <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Andoval </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendon </PERSON>, a bank official who died of a gunshot wound to the chest, and cashier <PERSON> Rosi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, 22, who was reported shot in the face. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said the two were killed during the escape attempt. However, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said they were shot earlier by the gunmen. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said authorities believed there were 59 hostages inside the bank. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Paliza </PERSON>, another spokesman for the <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state government, gave a different account of the incident. He said the gunmen became angry after the bank alarm was sounded, shot and killed three people inside the bank, fatally wounded <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, who died later in a hospital, and shot and wounded about 10 of the hostages. The gunmen then tried to escape through a bank window but were repelled by police gunfire, <PERSON> Paliza </PERSON> said. He added the gunmen released the wounded and were still holding about 40 people inside the bank building. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said police were negotiating with the gunmen by telephone, but refusing to give in to their demands for safe passage to the airport. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, assistant commander of the federal judicial police in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state, said authorities would permit the gunmen to leave the building only `` with their hands raised and if they respect the lives of the hostages.'' The six made telephone calls to state Gov. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and the Mexican TV network <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> demanding to be allowed to leave the site. More than 1,000 municipal and judicial police backed by fire apparatus had cordoned off several blocks surrounding the bank building, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION> is about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Tuscon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pacific Storm System Brings Rain, Wind, Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A huge storm system produced scattered showers and mountain snowfall across the West today after pelting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with hail and stirring up damaging winds. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered late Wednesday from western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> into the central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> valleys. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had localized flooding Wednesday and was expected to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain overnight. A combination of rain and glare from the setting sun caused a 39-car accident on the <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> Freeway Wednesday that injured 19 motorists, one seriously, in the City of Industry, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A funnel cloud or tornado tore up the roof of a home, uprooted trees and hurled a refrigerator from a porch into a ditch Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Snow was expected to continue falling today in the mountains of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with 4 to 8 inches expected down to elevations of 5,000 feet. Late Wednesday, when snow was limited mostly to elevations greater than 6,000 feet, Big Bear measured 5 inches of new snow and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION> reported nearly 3 inches. The storm system causing the rain and snow extended from the central coastal states into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Showers and a few isolated thunderstorms occurred from the northern Plateau region into northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Wind gusts of 54 miles per hour were clocked at <LOCATION> Lander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, Wednesday evening as showers moved into the area. A winter storm warning for as much as a foot of snow continued this morning for elevations above 6,500 feet in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered early this morning across much of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> panhandle. Rain showers were also scattered from the eastern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and upper <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the middle <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included more than a half-inch at <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and more than a third of an inch at <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and much of the area west of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, with snow in higher elevations; widely scattered thunderstorms in eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>; and scattered showers in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Highs were expected in the 50s or 60s across most of the nation, except 70s or 80s in the Southeast and from the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> to southeast <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 90s in western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 40s or lower along the Canadian border from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and 30s or 40s in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Occasional alarms and tension kept sailors alert aboard this guided-missile frigate in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> waited for signs of new Iranian attacks. Senior officers analyzed the tactical and technical data still flowing in on Monday's battles with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the gulf. Meanwhile, a search was called off for a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter carrying a two-man crew that vanished hours after the day-long exchange of gunfire on Monday had ended. Officers on the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, flagship for one of the three surface action groups of three ships each, said there was nothing to support <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claim that the AH-1 Cobra gunship was shot down. It was the third <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter lost in the gulf since July 1987, when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began providing naval escort for 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers re-registered under the Stars and Stripes for protection from Iranian attack. The 200-plus crew members of the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were still putting things back in order _ cleaning equipment, weapons and passageways _ in the wake of Monday's action. In the course of it, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired five missiles at the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and two destroyers sailing with it. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers said they were Chinese-made Silkworm missiles fired from anti-ship batteries along the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> for the first time. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had not determined what type of missile was fired. All five missiles went awry, their guidance systems confused by aluminum chaff fired into the air by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships. The 3,700-ton frigate, operating in the southern gulf, remained at Condition 1-Alpha, the second-highest level of alert in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, below General Quarters. The <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' skipper, Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> said: `` We can do this for a month if necessary, because we have trained, organized and planned to do it _ we came here ready for the long haul.'' An alarm sounded at midmorning Wednesday when the ship's radar picked up a signal that the <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> evaluated as a Sea Hunter radar system, one that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is known to possess and that can be used to locate a missile target. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said the radar twitch would be analyzed to determine where it originated. The missile destroyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and the destroyer <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> are also part of Desron 22, the <ORGANIZATION> Destroyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> aboard this warship. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s home port is <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> is based at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> warned off an Iranian C-130 aircraft, whose pilot at first ignored the ship's radioed challenges and then answered by saying: `` We are an Iranian warplane, doing our duty.'' A voice, speaking accented english, then said: `` Martyr, do your duty.'' Minutes after the C-130 landed at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s nearby <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the frigate went to General Quarters as a precaution against the possibility that a canister of CS, a non-lethal type of riot control gas, had been dropped in the area. A team checked the ship, and found no indications any such canister had been dropped. The ship also received brief reports of Iranian speedboats attacking commercial vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and the discovery of two floating mines, apparently by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy farther north. British and Italian minesweepers also were understood to be taking part in mine-hunting operations in international waters of the central gulf. Capt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, commander of Desron 22, said the mines apparently were floating rather than moored, and were found 70 miles southwest of where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guided-missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was severely damaged last week. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of laying the mine that damaged the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and retaliated by shelling two Iranian oil platforms. After that, Iranian attack boats went on a rampage and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces and neutral shipping. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or damaged six Iranian warships.

 The death of an American engineer killed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was unfortunate but justifiable, a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said after the man's family filed a $ 50 million wrongful death lawsuit against the rebels. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, 27, was fatally shot April 28, 1987, when Contra troops attacked the small hydroelectric project that the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, man was helping to build in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` He was killed during an ambush that took place in a highly active war zone,'' said <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Resistance based here. Named as defendants in the federal suit filed earlier Wednesday are the Nicaraguan Resistance; <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, directors of the umbrella organization; and military leaders <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Indalecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` They wounded <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and then shot him through the head at point-blank range,'' said <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>. `` This is an act of murder and those responsible should pay for their crimes.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan government is responsible for <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>'s death because it allowed him to go into an area that was obviously dangerous. She also said that <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, armed and dressed in a uniform, was with <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> when he was fatally shot. These factors make the attack during which he was killed legitimate, said Ms. <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON>, who added that `` <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>'s death is being used by his family'' for political propaganda <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>'s father, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, said his son's death `` was no accident. ... He and his co-workers were targeted by the Contras because they were bringing electricity to poor Nicaraguans.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> barred a militant Scottish member from the next 20 working days of Commons business for damaging the 16th-century staff that symbolizes the speaker's authority Legislators voted 463-26 Wednesday night to suspend <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a left-wing member of the socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> grabbed the ornate 5-foot-long mace in the Commons on Monday night and dropped it in front of the sergeant-at-arms in an angry protest over government cuts in welfare payments. The suspension vote followed <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s refusal Tuesday to read out a formal statement of apology for his behavior. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy voted to ostracize <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> from any role in party activities for three months. It is the first time in 21 years that Labor leaders have taken such action. The decision must be approved by a ballot of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 229 elected representatives. Their decision takes effect only when <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> returns from any suspension agreed by the Commons. `` The whole thing is a storm in a tea cup,'' the 47-year-old <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters before the vote. `` I have a job of work to do, and I will still do it even if I am suspended.'' At the end of debate Monday night, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> marched from his seat in the back benches on to the floor of the Commons, threw papers in the face of a junior government minister, then picked up the 16-pound mace from its resting place at the foot of the table behind which Commons officers sit. What happened next is disputed. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and other news media witnesses said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> threw the mace on the floor, causing an estimated $ 1,890 worth of damage to the silver-gilt staff, before storming out of the chamber. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says he accidentally dropped the mace. The mace is officially part of the Crown Jewels. Its presence in the Commons indicates the legislative body is in session. News reports said Labor Party Leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> is exasperated that the antics of rebel Laborites are distracting attention from <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s attacks on government moves to reform the post-World War II welfare benefits system. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and other militants have vowed to use `` guerrilla tactics'' to disrupt the Commons, in which Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives have a comfortable majority of 102. Unruly legislators now routinely hurl insults at each other and shout down opponents, ignoring appeals for order from Speaker <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>. Last month, <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> banned a <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator for five days for screaming abuse that caused an unprecedented suspension of budget day proceedings. The uproar was prompted by the government's announcement that it was slashing income tax for top wage earners from 60 to 40 percent.

 Paramilitary rangers accidentally set off a phosphorus bomb on a passenger bus in northeastern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, killing at least 22 people and seriously injuring 20, police said today. Among the dead was a 2-year-old girl, they said. Col. <PERSON> Sittisak </PERSON> <PERSON> Intomya </PERSON>, provincial police commander, said five rangers seated at the rear of the bus ignored pleas from other passengers to put away the bomb as the bus traveled in <LOCATION> Nonsoong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, 200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He gave no details on how the bomb was detonated, but said the men were believed to have come from <LOCATION> Pakthongchai </LOCATION> ranger base. The colonel quoted witnesses as saying one ranger escaped after the explosion. He did not specify if the other rangers were killed in the blast. Phosphorus is poisonous and mixes easily with oxygen and ignites spontaneously at room temperature.

 Immigrant schoolchildren are hampered by rigid placement practices, lack of bilingual education, cultural insensitivity, harassment from other students and fear of deportation, a new study says. Such children often are placed in classes for the handicapped or at inappropriate grade levels because schools ca n't cope with their cultural differences, according to the study released Wednesday. This is true even though `` the education level of many new immigrants ... is superior to that of previous migrations'' and sometimes exceeds that of Americans, added the 129-page study, titled `` New Voices: Immigrant Students in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Public Schools.'' The study was conducted by the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> and funded largely by the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that all school-age immigrants are entitled to an education, regardless of whether they are here legally, the study noted. About 6.6 million people immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1970s, more than two-thirds of them legally, forming one of the largest migrations in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and one that is continuing, the study said. Newcomers arriving now are primarily from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, it said. Immigrant children, who number up to 2.7 million, comprise about 6 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public school enrollment. After conducting public hearings in six `` gateway cities'' for immigrants and after interviewing parents and educators across the country, researchers reported that schools are doing a poor job of meeting immigrant students' needs. Some areas of the country are fostering an `` English Only'' or `` English First'' movement, undercutting public funding for educational programs serving students who speak little or no English, the study said. The movement `` sends a clear message to newcomers that their languages and cultures are unwelcome and inferior _ a point of view which ill prepares this country for the realities of its domestic and international future,'' it said. Dropout rates for immigrant students are high, suicide attempts are all too frequent and some young newcomers under extreme pressure have responded by forming gangs for emotional and physical protection, the study found. Though the study could provide no figures on how often immigrant children are misclassified into special education programs with physically and mentally handicapped youngsters, it apparently has happened frequently, the authors said. As far back as 1916, special classes `` frequently served as an easy means of disposing of a -LRB- non-English speaking -RRB- pupil who, through no fault of his own, is an unsatisfactory member of a regular class,'' the study said. <PERSON> Reine </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON>, an intergrou relations representative from <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, told the researchers, `` Teachers thought that these kids were dumb, that they could not learn.'' The study suggested restructuring public schools to better assess immigrant students for placement in appropriate grades, boosting the quality of bilingual education and providing counseling and support geared specifically to immigrants.

 Israelis celebrated their country's 40th anniversary under tight security today, and <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> threw a homemade explosive at soldiers in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> during PLO-ordered `` Firebomb Day'' in the occupied lands. For a second day, the army barred the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to prevent disturbances. It also barred journalists from most of the territories, where curfews were maintained over 23 refugee camps and towns for a fifth day. All told, more than 400,000 Arabs were living under curfew. In a special Independence Day interview, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said nearly five months of anti-occupation violence appeared to be winding down and called on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists to stop the rioting. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders' heads were `` in the clouds. Their demands have reached the skies.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 169 Arabs have died since the uprising began 19 weeks ago in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Two Israelis also have been killed. Despite the unrest, Israelis marked the holiday with picnics, hikes through the countryside and visits to army bases specially opened to the public. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> held a reception for veterans of the 1948 war in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> won its independence. The 24-hour Independence Day festivities were launched on Wednesday night with a torch-lighting ceremony at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herzl </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis then took to the streets to sing, dance and watch fireworks. In keeping with tradition, youths knocked passers-by over the head with plastic hammers and sprayed them with a dry foam. One of the highlights was a military show at <LOCATION> Ramat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> featuring parachute jumps, fighter jets, tanks and fireworks. It was the first display of armaments since 1973. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has tended to refrain from such exhibits to avoid emphasizing the role of wars in its history. Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today, including 16 soldiers outside the Dheishe refugee camp on <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s outskirts. Israelis were warned to be on the alert for suspicious objects during the holiday. Most Palestinians stayed off the job, observing a general strike call from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and underground leaders. They had also been asked to throw firebombs at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Palestinians hurled a gasoline bomb at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrol. Troops responded with rubber bullets, breaking all the windows in one home, according to an <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reporter at the scene. The soldiers also fired live rounds into the air and lobbed tear gas canisters. On Wednesday, underground leaders issued leaflet No. 14, which called on Palestinians to mark last week's assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> with strikes and demonstrations. Tunisian authorities and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources say he was killed by Israeli commandos. The Israeli government refused comment. The killing caused violent protests on Saturday during which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed 17 Palestinians, the highest death toll for a single day since the uprising began. Another Palestinian was shot to death Wednesday and 10 wounded in protests that defied curfews in effect since Saturday. Leaflet No. 14 bore a picture of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> and contained a pledge to him to `` follow your path until the flag to which you dedicated your life will be raised over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the capital of our independent Palestinian state.'' It also called for a general strike on April 28 to protest the deportation of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. Since Dec. 8, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has expelled 20 alleged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> agitators to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, the army established a new prison for Arab detainees north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to help incarcerate the 5,000 Palestinians arrested since the uprising began. If was the fifth new Israeli prison established since the uprising began, according to the Palestinian human rights group Law in the Service of Man.

<HEAD>Officials Cautiously Optimistic About Booster Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An apparently flawless test-firing of the space shuttle's redesigned booster rocket has improved the odds of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> meeting its goal of resuming manned space flight in mid-August, officials say. Wednesday's two-minute firing of the 126-foot rocket went smoothly, but spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the booster, say it will take a week to 10 days to verify the test was a success. A cursory inspection of the rocket afterward indicated the redesigned seals in the booster's joints prevented an escape of hot gases despite deliberately built-in flaws. `` It's a happy day for a lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, solid rocket program manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` So far, it looks excellent.'' In a post-test briefing, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> vice president for engineering, displayed a graph on which nearly identical curves compared engineers' predictions with a preliminary test evaluation taken from electronic monitors. `` Unless you're about only eight millimeters away, you ca n't tell any difference,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said Barring discovery of problems as the rocket is dismantled, Wednesday's success means <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> must conduct only two more full-scale tests, in June and July, before <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> can proceed with an August launch of the shuttle Discovery. It would be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first manned space flight since the shuttle Challenger exploded 70 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing seven crew members. `` It's like finally winning the quarterfinals of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said of the test. The critical concern is whether super-hot gases escaped the flawed seals. A presidential commission blamed the Challenger disaster on a joint between segments of the booster rocket whose seals failed, allowing gases to escape and ignite the space craft's exterior fuel tank Since then, engineers have added a third O-ring to the seals and a metal lip, or capture feature, to contain gases that may leak around the joints linking the four segments of the rocket. The case-to-nozzle joint also has been strengthened with 100 radial bolts to prevent vibration during launch, part of a redesign planned before the Challenger exploded. This joint attaches the nozzle to the aft segment. In the middle joint, engineers left a gap one-tenth of an inch wide between two sections of insulation to see if it would seal itself, under pressure from the expanding gases, as it has in short-duration tests. A second flaw was placed in the adhesive binding insulation inside the case-to-nozzle joint. A tiny `` blowhole'' was created to allow gases to reach the `` wiper'' O-ring, which was installed as part of the new design to keep the adhesive in place. However, it also acts as an additional seal to protect the primary and secondary O-rings. In the short-duration tests, gases have hit the wiper ring but have not gone past it. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said the flaws were more severe than anything likely to occur during manufacture or assembly. `` It is, indeed, a fail-safe. If at any time gas gets beyond the point we expect it to, the joint still is going to perform,'' he said.

 Mexican journalists say the shotgun slaying of a satirical columnist is part of a pattern of intimidation, and a colleague said he might ask <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s federal government to take over the investigation. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, the 47-year-old co-editor of Zeta, was killed while driving to work Wednesday morning, said District Attorney <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>. Police said they had not determined a motive. According to a spokesman for the state prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, a brown pickup truck with a camper shell pulled alongside <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>'s car. Shots were fired from an automatic 12-gauge shotgun. `` This cowardly act increases the climate of insecurity in which <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> journalists live,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Garca </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, city editor of <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>'s oldest daily, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heraldo </LOCATION>. He said he would go to Mexican President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> if state investigators do not solve the case. Five Mexican journalists have been killed this year, and 35 have been killed in the past decade. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION>'s offices were sprayed with bullets from a passing car. No one was injured and police never found those responsible. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Baca </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday a letter asking for an investigation into the slaying was being sent to de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. `` This assassination poses the greatest threat to freedom of the press in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> said. `` There's been a large number of other journalists who have met a similar fate, and it's obvious that it has become a pattern to silence the independent press in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Blancornelas </PERSON>, who co-founded the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> in 1980, speculated that the killing was an act of political revenge. `` The government said that it respects freedom of expression and that the police are among the most advanced,'' <PERSON> Blancornelas </PERSON> said. `` We hope that both those things might be demonstrated.'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, known as `` Felix the Cat,'' wrote for the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION>, which has a circulation of 60,000 throughout <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. His column, `` A Little Bit of Something,'' often accused government officials and business people of arrogant behavior. `` He was a satirist. He was very well-known and popular here in the state,'' said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON>, a writer for <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> had no known enemies and called the shooting `` an act of cowards'' aimed at muzzling the press. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>'s murder follows by two months the still-unsolved slaying of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgueno </PERSON> <PERSON> Orduno </PERSON>, editor of the monthly political magazine Deslinde, in the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastal resort city of <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>.

 A pro-Iranian underground group said today it will try Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on charges of spying. `` This criminal will be turned over today to the tribunal of the oppressed to try him for the crimes he has committed,'' said a type-written statement signed the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The Arabic-language statement was accompanied by a black-and-white photograph of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was serving with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped Feb. 17 The picture showed the balding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> with a stubbled gray beard grown in captivity, wearing a dark field jacket, his eyes looking down and away from the camera. It was the first photograph of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> released by his captors since he was kidnapped near the ancient port of Tyre. It was not known when it was taken. The captors released a videotape on Feb. 22 in which <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> pleaded with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to meet the demands they made for his release. Today's statement was the fourth from the group since <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was abducted. It was delivered to the office of the British news agency <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio station claimed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had been killed by his abductors during clashes between pro-Syrian and Iranian-backed Shiite militias in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The statement said the kidnappers had completed an investigation of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' activities in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It said among the charges he faced was `` spying for the criminal <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on our Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> peoples'' and `` active participation in American conspiracies against our Moslem people.'' The statement also said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was accused of supervising a `` Pentagon team to combat Lebanese and Palestinian Islamic organizations in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The statement said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was charged with `` collecting information and reporting to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> about the military and political situation in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' It claimed he was a member of what it called an American ccoordination committee `` on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and Palestine'' made up of officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The wife of American hostage <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> sent her husband good wishes for his 49th birthday in an advertisement published by the independent An-Nahar daily newspaper. `` Dearest <PERSON> Alann </PERSON>,'' said the published note from <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` We love you dearly. We are working and hoping with others that you will be with us again soon.'' The note assured him his two daughters were fine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was a communications instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped with two other American professors and an Indian educator Jan. 24, 1987.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Earth has apparently been spared the worst effects of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> weather phenomenon, with the most recent of these events coming to a close after a fairly docile stay. Droughts in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> were reported, as well as unusually heavy rains in portions of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which scientists have associated with the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION> which began in 1986. By contrast, the 1982-83 El Nino disrupted weather around much of the world, eventually being blamed for 1,500 deaths and damage totaling between $ 2 billion and $ 8 billion. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, confirmed Wednesday that <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> surface temperatures _ a prime gauge of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> events _ have returned to near normal. An <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> is considered underway when water temperatures rise one-half degree to one degree Celsius above normal in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> said. Currently, these temperatures have dropped back to normal or even a bit below, he said. Since climate conditions change only gradually, another <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION> is unlikely for at least two years. Indeed, it may be as long as four or five years, <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. In the meantime he has halted the monthly `` diagnostic advisories'' issued by his office on the event, known by scientists as the <ORGANIZATION> ENSO </ORGANIZATION>, for El Nino-Southern Oscillation. `` Low-level ... winds, sea surface temperatures, sea level pressure and central Pacific atmospheric convection indicate a return to non-ENSO conditions,'' <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> reported in his final advisory. The name <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- pronounced `` el neen' - yo'' -RRB- was applied by South American fishermen, who notice the event because it reduces the fish catch when water The change usually is first noticable around Christmastime, so the fishermen applied the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> name for child, referring to the Christ Child. Southern Oscillation is a term used by scientists, referring to changes in air pressure over the tropical <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Only in recent years have researchers determined that the two events are interconnected _ thus the combined name now in use. In a normal <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION> year there is a weakening of the Indian Monsoon, which occurred last summer, along with reductions in rainfall in such areas as <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION> weather patterns last year blocked the normal movement of storms in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, pushing them northward into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and apparently leading to a drought in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Warm weather in the western states and wetness in the Southeast are common when El Nino occurs. Thus, the wet winter in the Southeast in 1986-87 may also have been related to the event. These changes are what one would expect in an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nino </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> has said. By comparison, `` the 1982-83 one was unusual in that the weather changes were disasterous'' worldwide, <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> noted. That event was extraordinarily severe, while the one just ending was more like other recent El Nino events, such as those of 1957, 1963, 1965, 1969, 1972-73, 1975 and 1976. While scientists are still trying to determine what causes these periodic events, they have found that rising ocean temperatures are a major factor. The warm water warms the air above it, causing it to rise and increase circulation, and this seems to increase the strength of westerly winds which push the warm water eastward. These changes can affect weather around the globe, although researchers are still not sure exactly how all the various weather events are connected. The 1982-83 <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> was blamed for worsening the drought that claimed many lives in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In addition, that event brought a series of severe winter storms ashore in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, disrupted the fish catch in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, spawned the first typhoon to hit <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> in 75 years _ followed by five more in five months _ deluged <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> with record rainfall and promoted the worst drought in 200 years in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, fired for criticizing the slow progress of reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, says he was correct in speaking out, a Soviet-published newspaper said. In an interview in the May issue of the German-language Moskow News, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` I belong to the ones who are willing to take the rough road and have no fear of risks.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was fired in November after a critical speech in October before the Central Committee of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The report describes visits by a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s office, where he now works as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Deputy Chief of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constructions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and to a hospital where he was admitted temporarily for heart problems. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News is based in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> and lists as its publisher the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Novosti news agency. It also lists the giant <PERSON> Gruner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Jahr </ORGANIZATION> publishing house of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> as one of the West German companies cooperating in the publication. The May issue is the newspaper's first. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was quoted as saying he was surprised to hear that there were printed copies of his October speech. `` That must be a forgery,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` There was absolutely no -LRB- printed -RRB- text of my speech at the October plenum.'' But the interview, published with a photograph of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> walking with his grandson, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in what appears to be a park, indicates he does not feel he was wrong in criticizing the Soviet system. `` I spoke straightforwardly and said what I felt and thought was correct,'' the report quotes him as saying. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is quoted as explaining his reason for criticizing the slow-moving reforms without citing any names. `` Someone had correctly said: Each must think independently, so that later not all suddenly see the light all at once.'' The report says <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> declined to repeat what he had said at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in October because the committee had not formally decided to make the plenum remarks public. `` I as a Central Committee member am not permitted to violate this rule,'' the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as party chief of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Nov. 11 in what some political observers said was a move by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to appease opponents of his reform program for more openess in Soviet society.

<HEAD>Supermarkets to be Allowed to Offer Rainchecks, Substitutes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is moving to legalize a common supermarket practice, giving out rainchecks or substitutes when a store runs out of advertised items. While an effective date has not been announced, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-2 Wednesday to permit substitutes and rainchecks at grocery stores. Many stores of all types have been making such offers for years, of course. But technically, the practice was made illegal for grocery stores in 1971. In that year, the commission adopted a regulation requiring that grocers have enough stock on hand to meet `` reasonably anticipated demand'' for advertised items. Those that run out can be fined, though that has rarely happened in practice. Under the change approved Wednesday, grocers that do n't want to offer substitutes or rainchecks would be allowed to advertise items in limited supply if they clearly state in the ads that supplies are limited. The 1971 rule was adopted following studies that showed as much as 10 percent of advertised items were unavailable in markets in the 1970s. By 1984, however, that rate had dropped to between 3 percent and 5 percent, and the commission began to reconsider the rule. The commission staff at that time reported that the costs to supermarkets of observing the rule _ keeping added stock on hand and perhaps limiting advertising _ raised the cost of groceries more than the sale prices lowered them. In other words, the staff said, the rule was forcing consumers to pay an extra 1.4 cents to 3.3 cents a week in their grocery bill. On that basis, some commission staffers recommended abandoning the rule altogether, an approach that drew heavy negative public comment in 1984. Nonetheless, Commissioner <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> pressed again Wednesday to have the entire rule repealed. `` I do n't believe there is a problem,'' he said, contending that supermarket managers strive to please their customers rather than injure them. In such a competitive business, if a market regularly failed to stock advertised items, customers would just stop shopping there, he said. Commissioner <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON>, though, contended that the rule `` simply requires retail food markets to honor the promises they make in advertising.'' <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON> added that he is skeptical of the statistics that show the cost of the rule to be more than the savings to consumers, and said he opposed any changes in the rule that has been in effect since 1971. Thus, <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON> voted against the amendment to permit substitutions and rainchecks, but for opposite reasons. Voting for the new rule were Commissioners <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said he would prefer to join <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> in eliminating the rule altogether, but since that option had been defeated on an earlier ballot, he would support the amendment permitting use of rain checks or substitutes in order to give grocers as much flexibility as possible.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sought a new arms control agreement and prepared for the next superpower summit in talks today with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials acknowledged that verification and space-based defense development dampened prospects the treaty would be ready to sign at the May 29-June 2 summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, meeting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at a Foreign Ministry mansion, said as he frequently does before talks with the secretary of state: `` We are by nature optimists.'' Upon arrival from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was greeted by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> at Sheremetyevo airport, then traveled directly to the mansion. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not speak to reporters upon arrival. In a briefing Wednesday, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornienko </PERSON>, a top official of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the slow movement toward a treaty to reduce long-range weapons by 30 to 50 percent. Senior American officials, briefing reporters Wednesday in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> prepared for the talks, said the Soviets had taken a hard line on space defenses and that progress on monitoring three elusive weapons was also slow. The officials said the Soviets want cuts in strategic weapons, which have a range of more than 3,400 miles, contingent on adherence to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Soviets contend the 1972 treaty prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, the so-called `` Star Wars'' project to build a space-based nuclear defense. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected that demand. The other key problem is finding ways to monitor stockpiles of mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried on warships and fighter planes. Tracking sea-launched cruise missiles is probably the toughest point. In addition to arms control, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s agenda included talks on the Iran-Iraq war, which threatens shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wants the Soviets to back the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. With Soviet support, the council in July last year demanded a cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has since stymied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to impose sanctions to pressure <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who briefed reporters under rules of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> discussed the issue on Tuesday with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s attitude `` barely negative.'' On arms control, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> news conference it would be hard to accomplish in time for a summit signing by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet drafts of the accord have 1,200 distinct points of disagreement and the summit meeting is only five weeks away. About half of the points are technical, but the others touch on the difficult problem of verifying weapons reductions. On Dec. 8, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed a treaty scrapping their intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which have ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles.

 Soldiers patrolled <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> today in armored cars and tanks in a high-profile, anti-terrorist measure one day after the hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner freed 31 hostages in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. The airport's operators said the patrols, carried out regularly, were intended to familiarize soldiers with security at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and were not a response to a specific terrorist alert.

 Former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said today he made up quotes from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> out of loyalty to the president, and the adverse reaction to it has been a `` total surprise.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said he disagrees with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that his book `` Speaking Out'', which covers his six years at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and reveals the quote-manufacturing, constitutes `` kiss and tell.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, also said he does not fault the president for forgetting he told him about the phony quotes while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said in the book that a comment he provided as having been made by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was never said, and another quote he gave as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actually was said by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` I did it on the spur of the moment. I did it in order to serve the president. I did it as an act of loyalty to the president, certainly not as an act of disloyalty to the president,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said. The furor over <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' confession led to his resignation last week as chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ a job he took after leaving the White House. Reacting to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism of books written by a string of former administration officials, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said he does n't think any of the books, including his, falls into the category of `` kiss and tell.'' Such a book would `` have a little more juicy-type items in it that are a little bit more punchy,'' said <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>. As a former journalist, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> was asked if he did not know that making up quotes would be controversial. `` No, it was a total surprise,'' he said. `` A lot of people have told me that's done all the time in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that you supply a few quotes.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, who told a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> forum on Tuesday that he had been `` overzealous'' and `` misguided'' in concocting the quotes, said today he did not know whether the sin was in the doing or in the telling about it. `` It's hard for me to decide what I'm being critized for,'' he said. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> defended his book as an honest account that he hoped would `` contribute something to the long-term value of insights into the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency was a watershed because he has `` changed the way we think about government.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said he was pleased with indications that the book is selling well and said he planned to continue giving public speeches and promoting the book. `` I'll just let the dust settle a little bit and look at opportunities in the future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge: Lion Owner's Sentence Should Be Warning To Public</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stiff requirements tacked onto a probation sentence for a man whose lion mauled a young girl should warn the public that wild animals must be kept away from humans, a judge says. State District Judge <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON> on Wednesday ordered <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, to serve a 30-day jail sentence, to get rid of all his exotic animals and to stay away from children. The judge also ordered <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> to do 20 hours community service work each month with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and said he would have to approve any of <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON>'s future jobs. That was in additition to the 10 years probation and $ 5,000 fine set by a jury Wednesday. Last week, the same jury found <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> guilty of injury to a child. A lion owned by <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> attacked 8-year-old <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> last Oct. 10, biting off part of her skull and exposing the child's brain. She has undergone reconstructive surgery and will have to have more operations. The girl's mother, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, testified that the girl has to wear a wig or cap in public and has trouble concentrating. Since the attack, <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> has been jailed on two charges of indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a child. The cases, which are pending, stem from his allegedly using the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys, prosecutors said.

 For Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, who spent part of his childhood in a World War II internment camp, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote for reparations to Japanese-Americans was `` unprecedented in the annals of the history of any nation.'' For Sen. Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, who spent those same war years fighting with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it was `` long-denied justice'' that removed the `` one great blot'' on the Constitution. The two Japanese-Americans were on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor late Wednesday as it voted 69-27 to approve a $ 1.3 billion bill that would direct the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to give $ 20,000 tax-free payments to Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and placed in camps after the Japanese attack Dec. 7, 1941, on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. They also would get an apology. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted down, 67-30 and 61-35, amendments that would have deleted the payments and left only the apology. An amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, to withhold payments until <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> compensates American families for losses suffered at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> also was rejected, 91-4. <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, estimated that about half the 120,000 internees survive today, although `` they're dying daily, weekly of old age.'' The elderly would get the money first under the bill's five-year payout plan. But whether they get the money at all will depend on further legislative action and a possible presidential veto. `` It's a very proud day,'' said <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, who was a 10-year-old boy from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, when war arrived. `` I just wanted to be on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor when it happened.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without a doubt gave this country a great day,'' said <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I'm only sorry that there were n't more Niseis -LRB- Japanese-Americans -RRB- living today to be able to see a great nation apologize for its actions It is, I think, unprecedented in the annals of the history of any nation.'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, the bill's chief sponsor, was given the presiding officer's chair so he could personally announce the vote he had fought for years to win. At the end of the long, emotion-filled debate, he recalled his combat duty with an all-Nisei regiment and the fellow Japanese-American soldier whose death he witnessed. `` I had him cradled in my arms,'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` Lieutenant, I know I'm going to die, but I do n't mind because I know my people back home will be treated as <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. citizens.''' Of the 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were held in the camps, 77,000 were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, the rest legal and illegal aliens. Many, like <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, had been born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s other Japanese-American senator, said `` these payments acknowledge the unconstitutional deprivation of liberty ... and the stigma of being deemed unloyal.'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, fought in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where combat cost him his right arm and earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest military honor. The debate triggered other memories in senators who remembered the war. Some said an apology was in order, but cash payments were not. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., argued that the internment `` was not a dishonorable act, it was the option of a nation in the first days of a war. Even if it was dishonorable, Wallop argued, it would be `` repugnant to think a clear conscience is to be had for a mere $ 20,000 figure ... honor does n't come with a dollar sign on it and you do n't buy it back.'' Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., said: `` I can not in good conscience go back and tell survivors of <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Iwo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jima </PERSON> and all those battles in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and tell them we have forgotten you but we are compensating the people who we moved into camps. Money to pay the surviving internees will be contained in appropriations bills spread over the next five years, with $ 500 million to be considered as part of the 1989 budget now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While largely similar to the version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 243-141 vote last September, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version also provides a multimillion-dollar package for <ORGANIZATION> Aleut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> moved from the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> during a Japanese attack in 1942. <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, asked about veto prospects, said, `` We have mixed reports'' from the White House. The administration has voiced support for the measure, said presidential spokesman <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. But it has also sought changes in the legislation, including the deletion of money for payments to the Aleuts. Citing its $ 1.3 billion cost, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto the measure. But <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the former senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and now <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, had told him that if were still a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> he would have co-sponsored the legislation. <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> conceded that a veto `` would be very difficult to override.'' About 900 Aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live in abandoned mines, canneries and camps about 2,000 miles away. Lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and death and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in their absense. About 450 Aleuts survive and would be eligible for $ 12,000 payments. An additional $ 20 million would benefit Aleut villages and provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe.

 Some <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police officers are questioning a former colleague's claim that he was shot and beaten up at his home by three men who intended to kill him. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police lieutenant who once testified against a fellow officer in a murder trial, denied Wednesday that he staged the attack. He said he was assaulted because he testified last year that another <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police officer was a racist. `` I know it had something to do with that,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Spokesman-Review </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. `` It was absolutely physically impossible for me to do it to myself. It is impossible to hogtie and shoot yourself,'' he said. However, some <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police oficers cast doubt on <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>'s version of of how his head was grazed by a bullet in an incident Tuesday at his home northwest of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> was treated and released from a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> hospital, said <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> was described by Assistant <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgreen </PERSON> as `` a fellow who is really disturbed.'' `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> -RRB- reported that someone tried to kill him, but there was only a graze wound and powder burn,'' <PERSON> Burgreen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was handcuffed, tied up and had to dial 911 with his tounge. I find all of this very interesting.'' The incident `` makes no sense,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastus </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a police officer and director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Based on -LRB- <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>'s -RRB- past performance, there is a strong likelihood that he could have done that to himself or paid somebody to do it,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that the government may continue viewing alcoholism as willful misconduct instead of a disease is a `` decision without any heart'' but one that will not affect the help alcoholics can get, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said today. By a 4-3 vote, the court held Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> acted properly in refusing to extend educational benefits to two veterans who applied more than 10 years after their service. The two men said in their suit they had failed to apply earlier for the benefits because they were disabled by their alcoholism. `` We think the decision is wrong. We think it's a decision without any heart and a decision which really does n't treat the medical evidence in a very sophisticated way,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, in an interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the decision would apply only to the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, which he said has an archaic benefit rule. He said society recognizes that alcoholism is a disease and is `` far ahead of the VA or the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' The justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism is a disease, noting that the medical community remains sharply divided on that issue. But the court said the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not force the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to treat alcoholism as a disease. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said the men were suffering from `` primary alcoholism'' which is a result of `` willful misconduct.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling supports a system of regulations in place for more than 20 years and will not affect the way veterans suffering from alcoholism are treated in VA hospitals and clinics. `` It's really not going to affect -LRB- treatment of alcoholism -RRB- at all,'' <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We have a very comprehensive program as it deals with alcoholism in our 172 hospitals and 232 out patient clinics ... We have a very compassionate, understanding and concerned alcoholic program for veterans who have this malady.'' The ruling confirms a <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> rule that veterans suffering from primary alcoholism will not be given special consideration for benefits because of their addiction, said <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>. Veterans suffering from secondary alcoholism will continue to receive such consideration. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said the difference is that secondary alcoholism results from an underlying condition, such as psychological problems, and primary alcoholism has no such underlying cause. Experts in the insurance industry said medical insurance payments for alcohol rehabilitation will not be affected by the ruling. And in the medical community, treatment of alcoholics will remain the same, experts said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dogoloff </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, who was a Carter administration adviser on drug policy, said alcoholism `` has all the features of any other disease'' _ with a beginning, a progression and an end-stage condition. Though there are different types of alcoholics, <PERSON> Dogoloff </PERSON> said most medical researchers now accept that about 10 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> have the `` genetic vulnerability'' to become helplessly addicted to alcohol. `` Do you have a choice to take that first drink?'' <PERSON> Dogoloff </PERSON> said. `` Sure. But once that threshold is crossed, it becomes a disease'' for many alcoholics. He said companies will continue to support rehabilitation efforts because <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry has found that such programs are good for business. By helping alcoholics stay sober, <PERSON> Dogoloff </PERSON> said, companies have increased productivity, prevented accidents and prevented alcohol-related health conditions, such as liver disease, that can be expensive to treat. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bier </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling is unlikely to affect health insurance programs, many of which provide benefits for the treatment of alcoholism. `` Health insurance is a contract and if it covers alcohol rehabilitation, then that will not change no matter what the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> says,'' <PERSON> Bier </PERSON> said. And a spokesman for Alcoholics Anonymous, who asked not to be named, said AA `` will still work with people the way we always have.'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION>, said medical researchers have moved beyond the fundamental question of whether alcoholism is a disease. `` There are diseases that involve choice that are still diseases,'' he said. `` An example is coronary artery disease. If one eats fatty foods, it contributes to the disease, but it is still classified as a disease.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> defines alcoholism as `` an illness.'' The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a psychiatrists' catalogue of diseases, lists alcohol abuse and dependence. But <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the national president of <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision should challenge the idea that drunks are helpless victims of an uncontrollable disease, which she said has encouraged some judges to give light sentences for drunken driving. `` I feel this decision is fair and just and that this encourages judges to give sentences to fit the crime of drunken driving,'' she said. `` The fundamental issue is responsibility.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, convicted of being a brutal <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard despite his insistence that he was a victim of mistaken identity, admitted his guilt two years ago, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal says. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> autoworker who was found guilty Monday by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court of war crimes, said in the hearing of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Koury </PERSON> and another marshal accompanying him from a federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in February 1986: `` They do n't understand. It was war. I had to do it.'' `` The statement was made almost like he was thinking out loud,'' <PERSON> Koury </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` He was sort of looking out the -LRB- airplane -RRB- window. The statement was not made to the deputy or me. `` It was an admission of guilt. But I did n't think much of it at the time. I knew that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> had fought losing his citizenship and being extradited. But I did not know that he had denied that he was who they believed he was.'' And Deputy Marshal <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said: `` It was clear to me that when he realized he was really going to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he was trying to justify to himself what he had done. He was trying to rationalize.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was convicted of being the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp guard known as ` Ivan the Terrible'' for his brutality. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> helped operate the gas chambers at the camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942 and 1943. According to testimony at the 14-month trial, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> often exceeded the atrocities ordered by his superiors, beating prisoners on their way to the gas chambers with a metal bar or bayonet. He is to be sentenced Monday and could receive the death penalty. Two days after their arrival in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koury </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prosecutors interviewed him and <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> for four hours about <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s statement Both officers were listed as trial witnesses, though they were never called to testify. He said they also were asked by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Israeli government not to mention the statement until after the case was resolved. <PERSON> Koury </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> struck them as a man who knew his time was coming. `` I remember that when we landed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he turned and looked me square in the eyes and said, ` You've brought me here to be hanged,''' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. `` He seemed a little apprehensive as we were handing him over to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities,'' <PERSON> Koury </PERSON> said. But the only emotion he showed, the marshal added, `` was when he made that statement: ` They do n't understand. It was war. I had to do it.'''

 A black businessman was hospitalized after he swallowed pieces of glass and part of a mouse at a restaurant he had been warned to avoid, he and his mother say. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> `` Sterling'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 20, owner of a gift shop in a Holiday Inn, complained to <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police last week that he had received racist letters and an anonymous warning telling him not to eat in the hotel again. He lost consciousness after taking a bite of a crab dish Tuesday at the Holiday Inn restaurant. <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonasek </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arundel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> found scratches in <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s mouth and upper esophagus. More X-rays will be analyzed today, she said. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was released Wednesday.

Mrs. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said her son had sent his crab dish back to the kitchen to be reheated. When the food was returned, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> took a bite and they both heard a `` crunching sound,'' she said. He began to choke, stood up, grabbed his throat and vomited, she said. An official of the hotel said in a statement Wednesday he disputed <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s story. `` Our investigation of the matter and interviews with our employees gives us no reason whatsoever to believe that there is any truth to Mr. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s charges of either discrimination or contaminated food,'' <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorm </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Alexandria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the hotel and restaurant. `` No one on the property ever saw the contaminated food.

 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law prohibits the execution of murderers who were under the age of 17, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled. The court's decision Wednesday prohibits the state from seeking a death sentence against <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was indicted in <LOCATION> Clarke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for two murders alleged to have been committed when he was 15 years old and for three slayings when he was 16. <PERSON> Bankston </PERSON> is charged with murder in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in the April 1987 knife slayings of <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, two retired <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> professors; and the August 1987 hatchet slayings of <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>, 59, her daughter, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>, 22, and Mrs. <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 63. His attorneys say <PERSON> Bankston </PERSON> will plead innocent by reason of insanity. At issue in Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling was a statute dealing generally with capital cases which includes this provision: `` When it is shown that a person convicted of a capital offense without a recommendation for mercy had not reached his 17th birthday at the time of the commission of the offense, the punishment of such person shall not be death but shall be imprisonment for life.'' <PERSON> Bankston </PERSON>'s attorneys had filed a pre-trial motion to prevent the district attorney from seeking the death penalty, but it was rejected by the trial judge. The court said that the context of the statute did raise a question whether the Legislature intended only to block the the death penalty for those under 17 who were charged with capital crimes other than murder, such as rape, kidnapping and armed robbery. However, it said a 1977 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision effectively blocked the death penalty for all but murder cases.

Police said Shiite gunmen from various factions and Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement fought the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> militia for about an hour. A police spokesman said he did not know what sparked the clash, the second in four days between the Shiites and the Lebanese Forces. But it flared after the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> said it had thwarted a bizarre plot by the Lebanese Forces to assassinate <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>. The independent An-Nahar daily quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> official as charging that the Christians had assigned a maid working at <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s home to assassinate him with an `` explosives-rigged jacket.'' An Amal official contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said the An-Nahar report was true. He refused to disclose the woman's whereabouts or say whether she had voluntarily informed Amal of the alleged plot. The Lebanese Forces declined comment. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Lebanese Forces, led by <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, is at odds with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A strike called by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> was partially observed today, reflecting disunity among workers on how to combat a severe economic crisis. Representatives of the 300,000-member confederation toured <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors and other cities trying to muster support for the strike. The unions seek a 300 percent pay raise. They rejected the government's offer of a 75 percent increase. The Lebanese economy, once the most flourishing in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, has been torn by 13 years of civil war. Inflation is rampant, unemployment growing and the Lebanese pound has collapsed. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said about 50 percent of Moslem and Christian areas were closed. Some schools, restaurants, movie theaters, gasoline stations and other businesses stayed open in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Union officials led supporters in two demonstrations urging the government to respond to their demands. `` We are hungry, we want to eat,'' the estimated 3,000 demonstrators chanted.

<HEAD>Reparations Would Repay Debt But Won't Heal All Wounds, Survivors

 Reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II would pay a debt of honor, although it would not heal all wounds, said a man who unsuccessfully challenged the mass internment. `` Like someone who's a victim of a serious accident and becomes a quadriplegic, no matter what's voted in the way of acknowledgement of error, it'll never be whole,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill that calls for the government to apologize for the mass roundups and make each of the estimated 60,000 survivors eligible for a tax-free payment of $ 20,000. The House has passed a similar bill. After <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> attacked <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, 1941, about 120,000 Japanese-Americans were forced to give up their homes and businesses and put in internment camps. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinoshita </PERSON> rejoiced after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote. Forty-six years ago, she was uprooted from her home and sent to a camp in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` ` Pleased' would be an understatement,'' she said. `` We've been working for over 10 years to see this happen. I think it's great to see our nation admit an error, and take steps to remedy what was a great injustice.'' `` I think the Japanese-Americans have reconciled to the fact that certain things have taken place and there are some scars,'' said <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON>. `` At this stage, what they really wanted was an acknowledgement that a wrong was done and a vote for an honorable redress.'' <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON>'s World War II conviction of resisting curfew and violating the military internment order was overturned by a federal appeals court in September. The 9th Circuit, however, refused to rule on the constitutionality of the internment, which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had upheld during <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON>'s original appeals in the 1940s. Even though the government has not appealed the latest ruling, <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON> said his lawyers had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to take up the case again so the high court's previous decision can be removed from the records. `` The country does n't have too many opportunities to redress something,'' <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON> said. `` When it does, I think we should take that opportunity and look to the future to keep the honor of our country inviolable. `` I think that result would be the finishing touch to what the Japanese-Americans hope that their tragedy will contribute to.'' The issue took a long time to be resolved because of the shame the Japanese-Americans felt at being locked up and the federal government's willingness to bury the matter, <PERSON> Hirabayashi </PERSON> said. `` In this case, the victims were so traumatized by this experience that they had not recovered enough to talk about until a decade or so ago,'' he said. `` There was nothing in the history books,'' he said. `` Now the situation is different. We have to take some kind of historical perspective on this. Forty years is not all that long.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, a social worker for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who was incarcerated for 13 months, said the money was `` only a token ... but at least it is there.'' `` It was basically a concentration camp,'' said <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Kinoshita </PERSON>, who was 18 when she went with her family to the camp at <LOCATION> Minidoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was one of many Japanese-Americans who worked to convince the government that internment defied the Constitution and was a racist act. `` We hope this will acknowledge that this was a tragic travesty of justice, and that with this legislation we can hope that it will never, ever recur again to another group,'' she said. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawakami </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> attorney who has been active in seeking redress, said the money also was important because `` there are still significant numbers of Americans who believe the internment was justified because of what the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' He said the $ 20,000 was less than what individuals lost in being forced to move, but was significant enough to carry a message. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokiwa </PERSON>, a wounded veteran of the 422nd Regimental Combat Team, formed by Japanese-Americans in World War II, said the bill's passage accomplished part of what he and his buddies fought for `` But I wonder whether we will succeed in the rest? We went for freedom, the freedom to be treated the same, as Americans and there would be no such thing anymore as ` He's an Asian,' or ` He's a German,' or ` He's white,' or ` He's black,''' <ORGANIZATION> Tokiwa </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> observed a cease-fire today in their seven-week `` war of the cities'' after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired missiles into the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and said it would stop firing if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also did. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy commander said his warships fought a `` heroic battle'' against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Monday and charged the Americans fired on his men in the water after they abandoned their vessels. The unofficial cease-fire, which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said would begin at midnight -LRB- 4 p.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB-, appeared to be holding despite an all-out mobilization declared by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to confront the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. During their 7 -LCB- - year war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have observed several temporary cease-fires when one side offered to stop firing if it had the last shot The bombardments usually resume after a short period. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops fired two long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> at 11:45 p.m. and said they would be the last if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not retaliate. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said several civilians were killed and others wounded when the missiles exploded in residential areas of the holy city, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the seat of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious hierachy. The Iraqis earlier fired missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported civilians were killed, but gave no numbers. Since the latest flareup in the war of the cities began Feb. 29, hundreds of civilians have been killed in missile, air and artillery attacks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have pounded each other's cities intermittently since 1984. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian forces killed or wounded 300 Iraqis and captured more than 250 in the Shemiran mountain region of <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its forces were mopping up Iranian pockets of resistance in the southern <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which it recaptured from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the weekend. At <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used `` cyanide, nerve and mustard gases'' on a large scale during the battle in the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate USS <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> went on alert Wednesday after an Iranian C-130 transport plane ignored a warning as it approached the vessel in the gulf. `` We are an Iranian warplane, doing our duty,'' the pilot responded. `` Martyr, do your duty,'' added an unidentified voice. Minutes after the plane landed at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s nearby <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the frigate went to `` general quarters,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s highest alert, and crewmen investigated whether the plane had dropped a canister of CS riot control gas on the ship. Nothing was found. The Iranians' clashes Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the unexpected Iraqi recapture of Faw, the first major Iraqi offensive in two years, have clearly jolted the Iranians. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said all volunteers, known as `` basij,'' should report to bases throughout the country `` and get ready for departure'' to the battlefront. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed two Iranian oil platforms, sank an Iranian patrol boat, crippled two frigates and damaged three other attack boats on Monday. It was the worst U.S.-Iran clash since the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buildup last July to curb Iranian attacks on shipping. The Iranians said they lost 44 men in Monday's clashes. There were no reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties, but the two-man crew of a Marine helicopter was missing. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Iranian Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammed-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> as saying the Americans fired on crewmen from the frigate <PERSON> Joshan </PERSON> who had jumped into the water and killed several. The agency also quoted an unidentifed naval officer as saying the Americans shot missiles at Iranian crewmen in lifeboats and killed several, including a marine who had rescued six of his comrades. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer aboard the Williams, which was involved in Monday's fighting, said the captain of the Sabalan, the other Iranian frigate damaged in the battle, was `` a real fanatic.'' `` He's the one who shoots holes in the tankers in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, then says, `` Have a nice day,''' said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military teams are scouting <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and Southeast Asian nations for alternative sites in event new military lease agreements ca n't be reached with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' government, says <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s top <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> military commander. There is a `` serious-minded, success-oriented approach to the alternatives,'' Adm. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said in an interview Monday that he has been surprised at the intensity of issues being debated in the review of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains facilities at <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The agreement expires in September 1991. `` However, I'm still optimistic about reaching an agreement. The economic security and political implications associated with our departure would be astronomical,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. He declined to identify nations which might host <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. `` The problem is that the nations who are forthcoming to us on a private basis and who will readily concede that indeed bases at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and Subic are important are unwilling for a variety of reasons to go public and to take an official public position of support for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>. The admiral said it would cost $ 10 billion or more to duplicate the facilities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. However, he said that less than half that amount might be available to prepare alternate bases, which would mean a reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the region.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> today proposed including blacks in the electoral college that chooses the president and possibly in the Cabinet. In a major speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> stopped far short of proposing full black voting rights or abolition of apartheid legislation. But he said his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would stick to its widely criticized program of slow-paced reforms despite claims from the increasingly powerful far right that most of the 5 million whites oppose even modest concessions to the black majority. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s proposal to include blacks on the electoral college would, if implemented, mark the first time that blacks had a direct voice in the selection of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s president. He gave no details about how much strength blacks might be given on the college. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also suggested that the Cabinet might be opened to people not serving in Parliament. This would clear the way for participation by blacks, who are excluded from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s initiatives appeared unlikely to ease international pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for an end to apartheid, which establishes racially segregated residential areas, health services and schools and deprives the 26 million blacks of a vote in national affairs. But domestically, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s message seemed to be that his government would not be intimidated by the success of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in three recent parliamentary by-elections. `` I appeal to everyone to remain calm, to restore balance and to recognize each other's rights,'' he said. `` If we wish to live together peacefully in this beautiful land, the time has come to reflect on what unites us instead of emphasizing that which divides us.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> reiterated his government's longstanding proposal for creating a national advisory council on which he and his top Cabinet ministers would negotiate with black leaders on drafting a new constitution that would bring blacks into the central government. `` We are not committed to the name, the form, the composition or the functions of such a body,'' he said. `` We are committed to the concept of a forum for deliberation.'' Most prominent black leaders have rejected <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s overtures to participate in the national council. They say the government first must free imprisoned black nationalist leaders like <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and lift restrictions on major anti-apartheid organizations. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s prime minister in 1978. That postition was abolished in 1984 with the adoption of a new constitution, and he was installed as president. In his speech, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> proposed that the office of prime minister be revived to handle day-to-day governmment affairs so the president could be freed to concentrate on major policy matters and ceremonial duties. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said political progress in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be impeded by continued foreign pressure from the `` international brotherhood of persecutors.'' He also chided anti-apartheid clergymen, such as Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, for their increasingly vocal opposition to the government and their continuing calls for punitive sanctions. `` They take the lead in isolating the republic in economic and other fields, without caring in the least about the detrimental results,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` They accordingly play into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla movement fighting the government. The president said only a small fraction of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Christians supported the anti-apartheid stance of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other clergymen affiliated with the South African Council of Churches

 The trustee of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, who lost a battle in a federal appeals court over the ministry's right to tax-exempt status, says he may pursue further appeals. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday affirmed a decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. She found that the bankruptcy court where <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> is under reorganization proceedings did not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from lifting the tax-exempt status. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, trustee for the ministry founded by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, said the ruling may be appealed. `` Our hope is that we have demonstrated good faith to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> by the way the place has been run and the -LRB- changes -RRB- that have been made to operations and integrity that they might be willing to hold off,'' he said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> made the comment after a hearing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, during which Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> approved the sale of $ 3.2 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> property. Lawyers for the Fort Mill-based ministry had argued that the loss of the status could scuttle reorganization efforts. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said failure to revoke the status could cost the government from $ 55 million to $ 82 million in back taxes. The agency is seeking to make the revocation retroactive to May 31, 1981. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrek </PERSON>, declined to comment on the agency's next move. In <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> approved the sale of $ 3.2 million worth of property _ eight houses and some land in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wylie </LOCATION> area. One of the houses belonged to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, once <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top aide, and sold for $ 425,000 at an auction. The net gain to the ministry from the sale will be nearly $ 2 million, according to <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. An attorney representing a group of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> donors said he will file, within 30 days, a class action protesting the sale of any of the ministry's property. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanesky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said the donors' contributions are worth more than all of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s property `` Our claim will take up everything that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> owns,'' he said. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> told the people gathered in the courtroom that he has been getting telephone calls and letters supporting the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you've got any star preference you want to get back in, I'm not the one The trustee is the one to decide,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` It is not the court who employs preachers.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who stepped down from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 amid a sex and money scandal, said he wrote <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> last week requesting a chance to help the ministry back to financial stability. `` What would it hurt if <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> were given 90 days to see what we could do?'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Tuesday in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` If at the end of 90 days I had not helped, I'd be glad to walk off into the sunset.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he was seeking reinstatement as a minister with the Assemblies of God and is trying to arrange a meeting with members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in order to `` mend fences.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> also says he still hopes to buil a $ 2 billion religious resort in the desert near <LOCATION> Coachella </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He said Wednesday that he has not been able to buy a 1,700-acre site he favors, but insisted progress is being made toward developing his proposed Heritage Springs International resort, either there or elsewhere. Coachella Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> developer is interested in a country club project on the same land. The planned resort would include a 1,000-room hotel, three golf courses, recreational vehicle park, a 20,000-seat auditorium and a 1,200-seat theater for religious plays. It also would include a 5,000-seat television studio. `` We need to get back on television to move things along,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` It's the old question of the chicken or the egg and which comes first.''

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in a statement issued on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary, prodded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other nations in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> `` to move ahead and get to productive peace negotiations.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` remains convinced that our peace initiative is balanced and offers the only realistic basis on which to make progress,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. The statement was issued after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a U.S.-Iraeli memorandum that formalizes the two nation's consultative groups and their strategic cooperation. The groups meet periodically to discuss joint military and security assistance, as well as economic development issues. The Oval Office meeting, reportedly attended by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Isaeli </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, was closed to reporters. The memo, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement, `` reflects the enduring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. That commitment will never flag.'' `` The president knows that a strong <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is necessary if peace is to be possible. He also knows that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can never be truly secure without peace.'' The statement noted that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been asked to pursue the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative in the region and to seek `` a comprehensive settlement which will assure <LOCATION> Isareli </LOCATION> security and provide for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has shuttled among the Israelis and Arabs in recent weeks with little success in promoting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. `` The president reiterates his appeal to the leaders in the region not to miss this opportunity to move ahead and get to productive peace negotiations.

 A tribal judge said his dismissal of an attorney left him with no choice but to delay a hearing in a custody dispute between the Navajos and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> couple over a 9-month-old Navajo girl. Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Watchman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday recessed <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>'s temporary custody hearing for 48 hours after he disqualified a court-appointed lawyer from representing the child. `` Certainly a child has the right to be represented adequately at these proceedings, and that was the bottom line of this whole thing,'' Watchman said after the hearing. A tribal lawyer said it was likely another attorney would be named by Friday. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> was dismissed after he entered a motion to dismiss the temporary custody proceeding. Violet A.P. <PERSON> Lui </PERSON>, an attorney representing the tribe, declined comment. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Diakun </PERSON>, a tribal spokeswoman, said Watchman placed the baby temporarily in the custody of <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the non-Indian couple who have cared for her since birth and who want to adopt her. Watchman also ordered them to stay on the reservation, Ms. <PERSON> Diakun </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, 21, <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON>'s mother, was pregnant and single when she contacted the Pittses through a newspaper ad. She lived with them before and after <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> was born and has said she wants the couple to adopt her daughter. <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, the baby's grandmother, said, meanwhile, that tribal representatives had pressured her to sign papers seeking to bring <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> to the reservation for the custody hearing. Ms. <PERSON> Diakun </PERSON> said one reason the tribe entered the custody issue `` was a strong desire expressed by the grandparents that they wanted the child returned to the reservation.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> said she always has wanted the Pittses to adopt <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>. `` The way they talked at me, it seemed like they were just going to put me in jail or something like that,'' she said. The tribe intervened in the adoption proceedings under the Indian Child Welfare Act, which gives tribes jurisdiction under certain circumstances to determine custody in adoption proceedings.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said today that the Christian church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been `` cleansed and judged'' as a result of scandals involving television evangelists. `` Many of the clergymen are being certain that they have integrity in a way they did n't a couple of years ago,'' said he 69-year-old Southern Baptist minister, who is on a 16-day tour of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was defrocked by the <ORGANIZATION> Assemblies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> this month after he confessed to unspecified sins against the church and his family. A prostitute has said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to pose nude for him. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television empire, resigned last year in a sex scandal involving church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` I think the church has been, in a sense, helped by all this because it's been cleansed and judged,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said in answer to an American student's question at the <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Chinese and American Studies. He spoke during a question-and-answer session after addressing 150 American and Chinese students and faculty at the center, which the two schools opened in October 1986. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said the scandals will not destroy the Christian church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The church will always be there,'' he said. `` -LRB- It -RRB- is news when you have religion and sex and money all mixed up, but that's not the story of the regular churchgoer. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> on Wednesday evening, spoke for nearly an hour on the role of religion in American society. Afterwards, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> visited the <ORGANIZATION> Amity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the only printing plant in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that prints mainly the Bible and other religious material. The plant, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, opened in December and is expected to print at least 600,000 Bibles this year. Ninety percent of the facility's printing time is devoted to the Bible, which is sold at most Christian churches for about $ 1.90. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has preached in more than 60 countries, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. This is his first visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, was born and spent the first 17 years of her life in east <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province, where her father was a missionary surgeon. On Wednesday, the couple visited Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s birthplace in <LOCATION> Huaiyin </LOCATION> on the banks of the Grand Canal, the longest man-made waterway in the world. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the evangelist met with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and preached in a Chinese church. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is to speak to students at the Nanking Theological Seminary, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest theological training center, on Friday before going to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where he is to preach again.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, boosted by a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> newspaper's endorsement, plunged into a series of north <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> campaign stops today, five days before the state's Democratic primary. First stop was <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, where he donned a sweatshirt and gave enthusiastic students his familiar lecture on avoiding illegal drugs and teen-age sex leading to pregnancy. His speech was delayed for a few minutes as students crowded to the front of the <ORGANIZATION> Williamsport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium to get photos of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a sweatshirt with `` <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>'' on the front. The night before, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> staged a rally at a plaza across from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s City Hall, where a crowd of 3,500 cheered and called `` We want <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.'' The Democratic presidential contender appeared undaunted by his defeat in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Tuesday at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hands. `` We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,'' he said. `` We must go forward. We are almost there. You keep on holding on. I want to lead our nation beyond racism, beyond sexism, beyond anti-Semitism. `` I give you a choice ... I am the alternative in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was taken aback when told the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, an afternoon paper with a circulation of about 252,000, was giving him its endorsements in today's editions. `` I do n't believe it!'' he said. In its editorial, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Nominating <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sends a message to the world, which is not made up of elderly white businessmen, no matter what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> thinks. `` Social change does n't happen instantly,'' the editorial said. `` It took 32 years after the nomination of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to elect a Roman Catholic president. If it's going to take 32 years after the first black nominee, it's past time to get started, especially since the black man is the only candidate who seems to understand the soul of his own party.'' The same newspaper on Wednesday, joined by the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, published a poll that showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> running 40 percentage points behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. There are 178 Democratic delegates at stake in the primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to comment on the poll, saying, `` I do not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion. And that's why I am a leader. I will take my case to the people.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon, and was greeted by Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, the first black mayor in the nation's fifth largest city. Four years ago, the mayor supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s opponent, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, but he made an early endorsement of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this year. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> to visit AIDS victims. In the lobby he greeted employees and residents, stopping briefly at the elevator to shake the hand of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Graland </PERSON>, paralyzed by a bullet in his spine, who was lying on his stomach on a stretcher. `` He said to me, ` Hi brother, keep up hope,''' <PERSON> Graland </PERSON> said. `` I said thank you. I meant to wish him good luck but he went by so fast.'' After a half-hour session with a dozen AIDS patients, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brought victim <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Aller </PERSON>, 29, into the lobby. `` We need to shift the focus from hysteria to health care,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, urging that more resources be devoted to helping victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` I'm here because I care,'' he said.

The real estate mogul took a tour of the decaying, 85-year-old span, then said he would be willing to put up an estimated $ 250 million, which the government would repay, for repairs. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> rebuilt the Wollman Skating Rink under a similar arrangement. `` An easy solution is to spend a lot of money but if you can spend a little money and get the same results for it, or a better result, that's what I'd be here for,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said.

 Thirty-one hostages freed after 15 days aboard a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet flew to waiting families in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> today. Officials in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> denied reports that the hijackers found haven in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The 24 passengers and seven crew members from the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that was seized April 5 left <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport at 3:20 p.m. -LRB- 12:20 p.m. EDT -RRB-. They were freed Wednesday. KUNA, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s official news agency, said an official and public reception was planned for tonight. Most of the former hostages are Kuwaiti. The hijackers had demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> free 17 imprisoned terrorists, which <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rejected. But there were reports that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> agreed to commute the death sentences of three of the prisoners. Before the hostages left aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767, <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> said all were found fit to travel after medical examinations at the military hospital in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> was sent here to oversee the crisis. The nine hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaiti hostages, were believed to have left <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> after slipping out of the plane ahead of the hostages at dawn Wednesday. KUNA, citing unidentified Algerian sources, said Algerian mediators promised the hijackers safe passage to travel to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believed the hijackers went to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. CBS, without naming sources, said today that the hijackers had arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport officials, also speaking privately, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the hijackers had not arrived. The plane was seized April 5 on a Bangkok-to-Kuwait flight with 112 aboard and diverted to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where the terrorists released 57 hostages. Freed passengers said they believed more gunmen boarded at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> with submachine guns and dynamite, which was later wired to the plane's doors. After three days in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, the plan flew to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. During five days there, the hijackers beat two <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> security men, shot them to death and dumped their bodies from the aircraft. The hijackers let 13 more hostages go in exchange for fuel that brought them to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Several days before giving up, the hijackers freed an ailing passenger. Throughout the ordeal, the hijackers demanded that the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> sheikdom free 17 pro-Iranian extremists imprisoned for the 1983 bombings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> steadfastly refused, and its rulers were lauded by their people on Wednesday for standing firm. But there was some anger expressed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> because the hijackers had been allowed to go free. The deal also provoked criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Montreal-based trade association that represents 170 international airlines. `` They are not only hijackers but murderers,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> on Wednesday while en route to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for pre-summit talks. Western intelligence officials have said they believe two of the hijackers were Lebanese nationals under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was slain. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, security director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` We can assume we have not heard the last'' of the hijackers. `` We now have the possibility that a number of trained hijackers could lead missions of their own.'' Neither <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would disclose terms of the deal. However, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believed the Algerians provided the hijackers with letters or tapes from the 17 prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> so friends and relatives could see the prisoners had not been harmed. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said efforts were made to assure the hijackers the 17 were not mistreated. But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not confirm the the hijackers were given letters or tapes. KUNA said the hijackers left the plane in two shifts 10 minutes apart on Wednesday. The hostages staggered down the gangway 20 minutes later.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> report on human rights accuses <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s armed forces of political repression and murder, but government officials criticized the study as one-sided. `` There have been only a few occasional faults or excesses, and these have been punished as an example for others,'' <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, told reporters Wednesday In a report released Wednesday, the London-based international human rights organization accused <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s armed forces of engaging in a `` policy of terror and political murder.'' The report said the armed forces plunged the country into a `` human rights emergency'' by extending political repression to encompass not only leftists but anyone who failed to support the government forces. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s adviser on human rights, said, `` if the <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> report shows the armed forces and the government as the only sources of violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, then it is one-sided.'' Former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrizosa </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not share the opinion of Amnesty when it charged the `` existence of a deliberate policy of political murder'' in the armed forces. He said he had `` no evidence for these charges.'' `` There are paramilitary groups,'' he said. `` These have been denounced since 1983 by the attorney general. ... My question is: Why has there been no investigation of those paramilitary groups?'' Amnesty said that in July and August political repression in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> entered `` a new phase, and the country is in the grip of a human rights emergency.'' In those two months anonymously authored ` hit lists' of prominent Colombians were published and a wave of killings of students, university lecturers and human rights leaders in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> was reported. Amnesty said `` hundreds of case studies show that killings and ` disappearances' blamed on the ` death squads' were in fact carried out by police and military personnel.''

 Newly released police files reveal that the young woman who reported a `` girl in a polka dot dress'' running from the scene of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination admitted two weeks later that she had lied. `` You know, I thought I was supposed to see more _ more than I did,'' the woman, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, says in microfilmed documents in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that could lay to rest 20 years of controversy over the report. Meanwhile, a former prosecutor said he is certain no photographs or investigative matter important to the investigation of the June 5, 1968, assassination were purposely destroyed by police. `` There just was n't any reason for anyone to just deliberately destroy something that had any significance,'' the former prosecutor, now Judge <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday by telephone from a home he has in <LOCATION> Lopez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The files, opened at the state archives on Tuesday, contain a certificate that shows 2,410 police photographs were burned on Aug. 21, 1968. Chief archivist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> speculated the photos may have duplicated others still in evidence. But he said the files contain no such statement. A large portion of the documents deals with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, a college student who reported that she had confronted the woman on the night of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s shooting at the Ambassador Hotel in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The files showed that Miss <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> first told her story to officers at 4 a.m. June 5 at police headquarters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. She was one of hundreds of witnesses interviewed. Miss <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, who said she was chairman of the Youth for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> chapter in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, said she came to the hotel that night to hear <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> speak but left the Embassy ballroom because it was too crowded. She recalled being seated on a step outside when `` I thought it was a backfire of a car. ... I thought I heard six shots, six backfires. `` About half a minute later this girl comes tearing down the stairs saying _ she said, ` We shot him We shot him.' And I said, ` Who did you shoot?' And she said, ` Senator <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''' She said she had seen the same girl earlier in the evening and she was clad in a white voile dress with dark polka dots. She stood by her story for a time and even went with police to the Ambassador Hotel for a reenactment of her actions, the file showed. But on June 20, 1968, when she was reinterviewed by police after failing a lie detector test, she declared, `` The whole thing was a lie.'' She suggested that she and other witnesses who told police about the polka dot dress had created the story while waiting to be interviewed by police. She blamed the pressures and excitement of the event for her actions. And she indicated she almost began to believe her own fabrication. `` I do n't know why I said it. ... It just fitted. ... I really thought there was something behind it. I was conned,'' she said. The following day, June 21, police canceled an all-points bulletin for a woman in a white polka dot dress. However, the story did not die, and triggered years of controversy over whether <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, the man convicted of killing <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, had acted alone.

<HEAD>Meat Industry Putting Out Leaner Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cattle producers are already turning out much leaner beef than many people think, and those steaks, roasts and burgers probably will lose still more flab if consumer demand continues, says a new study by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M. Moreover, although researchers say it's hard to tell for sure, those juicy fast-food hamburgers probably are leaner than they sometimes look. Overall, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M study found the amount of visible or separable fat was down 27 percent in retail cuts from two years ago, and the fat content of ground beef was down 10 percent. The study, which was released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, involved supermarket surveys in late 1987 and early 1988 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Randomly selected retail beef cuts contained an average of 78.9 percent separable lean, 11.7 percent separable fat -LRB- 3.3 percent external fat and 8.4 percent `` seam'' or intermuscular fat -RRB-, and 9.4 percent separable bone and connective tissue. The weighted average of fat content of all retail beef cuts in the 1988 survey was 9.99 percent, compared with 13.76 percent fat in 1986. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M told a news conference that while Americans like beef, their perception is that it's a fatty product. Earlier studies showed `` marked improvement'' in consumer perception when the outside fat on retail cuts was trimmed to one-quarter inch of fat or less, compared with the previous standard of one-half inch. Most retailers began using the quarter-inch fat trim after 1985. `` The reduction in separable fat meant that long-standing assumptions on amounts of fat Americans were getting from beef perhaps were not correct'' and that more up-to-date information was needed, <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> put up $ 20,000; the <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, $ 20,000; and the <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000 for the new study. The project was administered by a foundation of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Savell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M colleague, said the study found that more than 40 percent of the retail cuts had no external fat. The average fat thickness on steaks and roasts from primal cuts, or the major wholesale cuts, was 0.14 inch, while the average for all cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat was 0.11 inch, or less than one-eight of an inch, he said. `` We found that the amount of beef fat in American supermarket meat cases on a given day is now 1.2 million pounds less than in former years,'' <PERSON> Savell </PERSON> said. `` That's 4 -LCB- billion fewer calories.'' A committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> recently reported that Americans are eating too much fat and urged the industry and government to help correct the situation by breeding leaner animals and changing federal grading regulations. Cross said the latest survey showed that in the case of beef the less-fat recommendation of the scientific panel is being carried out. `` The next step in the war on fat is to trim more of the fat at the packer level, where it can be done more efficiently,'' he said. `` Eventually, we must depend less on butchers' knives to get rid of the fat and more on production of leaner cattle.'' Further changes are needed in the marketing system so that cattle producers are rewarded financially for turning out cattle with less trimmable fat, he said. Cross said the impact of leaner beef on fast-food hamburgers is difficult to determine. `` First, we need to realize that the fast-food ground beef is probably not as fat as you might expect,'' he said. `` The average fat content is probably somewhere between 18 and 20 percent for the fast-food hamburger, whereas the average for this study was right around 19 percent.'' That does n't mean your favorite juicy burger at the local drive-in is leaner than the meat bought at supermarkets. `` There's essentially three kinds of hamburger that are normally offered at retail _ regular, which is around 23 or 24 percent fat; lean, which is around 18 or 19; and extra-lean, in this study, which was around 14 to 15,'' <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. `` So, fast-food ground beef is right in the middle of the pack.''

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has sent the state a $ 230,717 bill for his recall campaign expenses, including office rent, a down payment on a fund-raising letter and legal fees. The bill lists expenses incurred by the former governor from Feb. 1, the date then-Secretary of State Rose Mofford called the recall election, to April 4, when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of impeachment charges and removed from office. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> became governor. Under the state constitution, public officials facing a recall election are allowed to bill the state for reasonable campaign costs. But the constitution does not outline what action should be taken if the recall election is canceled, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. The May 17 election was canceled by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on April 12. State Treasurer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rottas </PERSON> said he has no authority to pay the bill without an appropriation from the Legislature. Bills have been introduced to pay <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> anywhere from $ 75,000 to $ 150,000 for campaign expenses, but legislators have not seriously discussed either proposal. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s bill, sent this week to <LOCATION> Rottas </LOCATION>, includes as `` reasonable election campaign expenses'': _ $ 28,543 in payroll costs, including $ 8,280 to <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who was put on unpaid leave from her job as a <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> special assistant on Nov. 9 to coordinate recall activities. _ $ 3,600 in rent payments for his <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> office, located in a building he owns and has occupied since shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Feb. 5 to impeach him.

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said today his mission in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was accomplished after a midnight meeting with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, whom he described as responsive. The two discussed the relationship between church and state in this atheist nation. The meeting in the presidential palace lasted until about 2:30 a.m., <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> received <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> at about 11 p.m. after the cardinal celebrated an evening mass in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic cathedral. `` We discussed the general relationship between the church and government here. We discussed the possibility of building bridges for peace,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters as he toured medical clinics in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Casto </PERSON> was especially laudatory of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader expressed delight at the idea of getting visas for more to come to the country. `` I feel that the mission was accomplished, that the president recognized clearly my primary purpose for coming here, and that was to show my solidarity with the bishps of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and to show that the church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the church in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and throughout the world is one church,'' he said. Earlier today, thousands of worshipers filled the cathedral for the Mass. About 2,000 people poured into the 284-year-old cathedral in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s colonial district for <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s first Mass in the capital. Church bells rang and the applause was deafening as a procession of 75 white-cloaked clergymen walked slowly toward the altar, singing the hymn `` Pueblo del Rey,'' or `` Land of the King.'' As the cardinal neared the altar, a man grabbed his hand and kissed it. The procession included all seven of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops and Monsignor <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> archidocese </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> native who returned to his homeland on Tuesday for the first time in 27 years. `` There has been a mistake,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said jokingly in Spanish, addressing the huge crowd. `` You've welcomed me as a pope, but I am only a cardinal, a poor cardinal.'' Reporters barely got a chance to hear the cardinal speak before they were hussled to a bus and taken to the presidential palace. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, editor in chief of <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a weekly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, briefed reporters at the palace on the cardinal's remarks. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> departed from his prepared text several times, once to introduce <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON>, who he said was suffering from cancer. `` We have great hope that there could be a miracle and we hope so because he is an inspiration, he's a saint and an inspiraton,'' the cardinal said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> also called it a `` miracle'' that <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> had been allowed back in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after leaving in 1961 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He thanked the Cuban government for allowing <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> to visit his homeland. Repeating the theme of his four-day <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the church must be allowed to serve as a `` bridge'' between people, regardless of political ideology. `` I hope that peace will come to the peoples of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the peoples of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` But peace is not possible without justice for everyone.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cardinal to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power in 1959 and this was his first Mass since arriving in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Tuesday. He is in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a guest of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to help celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>. The priest, who served in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from 1823 to 1853, is considered a Cuban hero in the struggle against Spanish colonial rule.

 A small earthquake shook northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> early today, causing no damage but the rumbling awakened some residents, authorities said. The quake registered 3.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered in the <LOCATION> Palomar </LOCATION> area 30 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsch </PERSON>, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey's Earthquake Information Center in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded on a seismograph. Some 40 people called radio station <ORGANIZATION> KMLO </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION> to report they felt the 1:15 a.m. temblor, said station employee <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mars </PERSON>. `` It woke a lot of people up,'' he said, adding that the calls came from as far north as <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION> and eastward to <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> line.

<TEXT>
 The two-hour battle neared its climax. Tension was palpable. Rhythmic chants from fans urged on the competitors, who wiped sweat from their brows as the interlocutor spoke like the voice of the Chronicler. When it was over, the annual International Bible Quiz had its first American victor in 15 years. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weider </PERSON> had won the World Series, the Super Bowl, the World Cup of Old Testament scholarship for Jewish teen-agers. `` I'm elated,'' said the 17-year-old from <LOCATION> Monsey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I studied so hard for this. Two hours of Bible reading every day for seven months. But I never thought I'd win.'' <PERSON> Weider </PERSON>, a religious Jew who attends <ORGANIZATION> Yeshiva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, shared first place with <PERSON> Zehava </PERSON> <PERSON> Heder </PERSON>, an Israeli with an identical point total. Contestants were given more than 20 questions involving intricate details of quotations from the Jewish Bible, which is the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. The last question was posed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who asked them to identify 10 quotations about visions of peace. The co-winners were among hundreds of Jewish teen-agers from around the world who came to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for the contest, which is held every year on Independence Day and broadcast by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` This is a really big deal,'' said <PERSON> Noga </PERSON> <PERSON> Harom </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, who finished second last year. `` It's a huge honor. I mean, these are the very best Bible students in the world. `` Usually only the Israelis win because they're so well-trained. Now the underdogs have taken it. It's a World Series upset.'' `` Thank heavens the pressure's off,'' said <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, 17, from <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who placed fifth this year. `` It was so much work.'' An audience of nearly 1,000 attended the contest in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> theater. As the field was reduced to seven finalists, fans grew more boisterous in support of their favorites. One group chanted the name of one contestant, `` Oren! <PERSON> Oren </PERSON>!'' as though at an athletic event. `` Sshh!'' an elderly man admonished. `` You're at a Bible quiz, not a football game!'' Competitors were the winners of regional contests from 19 countries, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The competition is sponsored jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Religion ministries and Jewish organizations. <PERSON> Weider </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heder </PERSON>, the co-winners, received elegant sets of religious volumes. Many teen-agers in the audience said they were glad they gave up holiday picnics and barbecues to attend. `` What a great way to celebrate Independence Day,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, an 18-year-old student from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` It really gives you a sense of pride.''

<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The Guardian of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- liberal -RRB-: `` It was the dirtiest, most dangerous race so far: and some of the details of the result are concomitantly disheartening The blacks of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voted for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The Jews -LRB- after particularly unpleasant broadsides from Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> -RRB- voted against him. There's a clear racial divide in the final primary accounting, with too much potential for bitterness left behind. Cheerfully, however, the winner and runner-up were in action yesterday stressing harmony and unity. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have the opportunity to make something good out of something bad; and they see the need.''

<TEXT>
 _ <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON> writing in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Repubblica </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> -LRB- left-leaning -RRB-: `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of racial grudges, ... of too much money and too much misery, accomplished with brutality, perhaps with honesty, that which the rest of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had not yet dared to do: it told <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the black population that their challenge to the sky can not be accomplished `` The black Icarus of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics saw his wings melt when he got too close to the sun of victory. He will keep on flying, he might even score some victories in the remaining 50 days of primaries before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ... but the duel for the conquest of the White House seems a private affair between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.''

</TEXT>

 _ <PERSON> Ennio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caretto </PERSON> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stampa </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> -LRB- moderate -RRB-: `` ... in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the melting pot of the superpower, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> voted against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and against what they wrongly thought he represented ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> saw in the black leader both adventure _ the friendship with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> _ and revolt: in other words the claim of socio-economic equality.''

<TEXT>
 _ Business Times: `` The acrimonious <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign is over And, finally, the Democrats have a reasonably clear front-runner for the presidential nomination, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Still, from a long-distance perspective, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics appears to be suffering from a despairing lack of leadership. At the beginning of the marathon campaign, Americans had the luxury of choosing from a gaggle of candidates. Yet, the voters seem to waffle, first to this one then to that one. The problem appears not to have been too many possibilities but the lack of a distinct choice. ... `` Now that the field has been presumably narrowed to just two front-runners _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose Republican nomination needs only the sound of a gavel _ perhaps the candidates can stop defending their electability and start showing their leadership qualities. The voters are waiting, and the rest of the world is watching.''

 _ O Estado de <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> -LRB- conservative -RRB-: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and his brilliant conquest of the lead in the arduous primary races are due less to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s flaws than to the qualities of the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> The American voters see in this austere man, so opposed to demagoguery that he becomes even boring by the criteria of the mass media, the image of security and honorability they want to see connected with the presidency, an institution eroded by scandals in recent times.''

 Avoiding alcohol after the prom could be beneficial _ and not just for the obvious reasons. Students who attend an after-prom party Saturday night will have a chance to win a 1976 Mercury Montego worth at least $ 500. Organizers said the event is designed to offer students an alternative to customary parties with alcohol. Students who wear formal attire to the party, arrive within 30 minutes of the end of the prom and stay until the end of the festivities will be eligible to win the car. Special drawings also are planned for a VCR and dinner for two. Co-chair <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the car has 140,000 miles on it, but a mechanic has checked it and it appears to be in good shape. `` A bunch of us mothers are going to wax it. We think it's going to be OK,'' she said.

 A Rice University senior was placed on probation and told to pay $ 1,500 for rotating a statue of the school's founder <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, 23, called the discipline reasonable but said he has no regrets about the prank he carried out with 10 other students. `` It was in the true spirit of college pranks and of a great engineering school,'' he said, adding that he still expects to graduate May 7. `` It was a fun thing to do, to make people smile and laugh. No one has criticized us,'' he said, `` except for the president and the proctor. And it's their job to criticize us for it.'' E.C. <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, the school's proctor and chairman of the civil engineering department, said `` there was the potential for all kinds of bad things to happen.'' The 58-year-old statue of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, which normally faces east, rests atop a granite base containing an urn holding the founder's remains. After the prank on April 12, it faced west. The fine represented the cost of turning the statue back to its customary direction.

<HEAD>Man Who Put Building Inspector's Eye Out Gets Maximum Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who put out the eye of a building inspector who told him his fence was too high received a maximum seven-year sentence after writing to a judge that the victim was lucky he was n't shot. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was sentenced to seven years in prison Wednesday for mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon, stemming from the May 11 maiming of <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Daniels </PERSON>, 62, a building inspector who told him his fence was too tall. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> imposed the maximum term after a letter from <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> was read in court that said <PERSON> O'Daniels </PERSON> `` is complaining about his eye. He is lucky he did n't get shot instead. ...'' <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> also wrote that the city inspector `` came to rearrange my attitude. Believe me, he tried. He got his face rearranged, instead.'' The letter then asked for leniency in sentencing. `` I believe Mr. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> is smugly satisfied with what he did,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said as she handed down his sentence. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, who was convicted March 29, was also fined $ 5,000 Wednesday. He yelled, `` I wo n't pay a damn penny to this court,'' as he was taken into custody. According to trial testimony, <PERSON> O'Daniels </PERSON>' right eye had to be removed and he lost half the sight in his left eye after <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> beat him with his fists and a shoe. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> maintained throughout the trial that <PERSON> O'Daniels </PERSON> had started the fight after demanding a bribe. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, and his two children wept during the sentencing. They each wrote letters to the judge saying <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> is a model husband and father. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 3 -LCB- years.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today signed into law a bill that will make <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` the nation's laboratory'' in ensuring that health insurance is available to all residents by 1992. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has cited the measure in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, said the first-in-the-nation law will `` erase the uncertainty too many people face when they or a loved one becomes ill but lack the means to pay for the cure.'' In written remarks for an elaborate Statehouse signing ceremony, the governor said, `` We have good reason to rejoice today, as we again become the nation's laboratory.'' The proposal makes <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` the nation's pathfinder blazing a trail that leads to affordable quality health care for every man, woman and child.'' `` We have made a start here at home,'' he said. `` Now we must make it work. And then we must carry the message of health care for all across the country so that the other 49 states join us.'' Only <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which has a federal exemption allowing it to mandate employer health coverage, currently has anything comparable to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law. However, the new legislation, which <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> aides say has generated inquiries from more than 20 states, goes beyond <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s approach by offering health security both to working and non-working residents The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> proposal to make health insurance available to all by 1992 will cost the state $ 645.2 million over the next five years, according to figures released Wednesday by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The bill, the outcome of a nine-month legislative struggle, comes two years after <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters endorsed a non-binding referendum by a 2-1 margin urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` enact a national health care program -LRB- that -RRB- ... is universal in coverage.'' The thrust of the bill is to provide coverage to an estimated 600,000 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents under age 65 currently without health insurance _ about one out of every 10 people in the commonwealth. The plan is to do this in stages and through a variety of approaches _ from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults and children to state-brokered pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> health policy adviser <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said she hopes the coverage will begin operations July 1, the start of the fiscal year. The plan passed the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last week by narrow margins blamed on the deletion of some special interest amendments and lingering doubts about how much the law will cost. Although fully prepared to sign the law, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as late as Tuesday was telling reporters he did n't know the bill's ultimate cost. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged Wednesday that there had been `` some confusion'' about health care costs. `` Sorry I did n't have the information yesterday. But I'm not a technocrat, I'm a leader,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, joking about his national image as a dispassionate, hands-on manager. On Tuesday, the governor swept to victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary, solidifying his chances of becoming the party's nominee in next fall's presidential election. Even the chief drafters of the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> and Means committees, were unable to agree on the measure's cost. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> placed the state's cost at about $ 550 million and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> estimated it as high as $ 1.2 billion. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presented figures Wednesday showing the state's share of the plan would rise from $ 34.5 million this fiscal year to $ 195.4 million in fiscal 1991. The state's share is expected to drop to $ 162.7 million in fiscal 1992, according to the governor's figures. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said state costs beyond fiscal 1989 are hard to estimate because they will depend on how many employers decide to offer health plans as a result of the law.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, leading <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the Democratic presidential race, said today that finishing second in the primaries does not entitle anyone to second spot on the national ticket. He said that he alone, if nominated, will pick his running mate. `` What you're looking for is somebody who, first and foremost, could be a first-rate president if something happened to the president. That's where you begin,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I were to finish second, it would n't entitle me to anything more than consideration, period,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer questions about the vice presidency away from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it's pretty well in hand,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If that happens, then I will begin what I hope will be a thoughtful and thorough process of selecting a running mate. But I'm not going to do anything on that _ quite literally _ until the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> primaries are over,'' he continued. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who leads in nominating delegates and in popular votes, was asked about a statement from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the nomination the runner-up would deserve `` consideration'' for the second spot on the ticket. `` The nominee makes that decision _ as he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- himself said. And rightly so,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Since his solid victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has become the focus of speculation about his choice for a vice president. According to aides, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have not discussed the issue in any of their private conversations. Publicly, both men insist that the question is premature until the nominating process has produced a Democratic nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leaving tonight for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for campaign stops. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary is Tuesday; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s is a week later. The governor had events scheduled this evening in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been spending three to four weekdays in the Statehouse each week while running his Democratic presidential campaign, noted Wednesday that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't in a position to campaign full time either. `` I would assume and expect that the vice president has to spend some substantial portion of his week making sure he knows what's going on, that he's fully briefed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference `` So both of us have the same problem.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who bested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 14 percentage points in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was treated like a conquering hero when he came back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Dozens of Statehouse staffers thronged the governor's outer office shortly after noon and let out a cheer for the governor and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>. `` We love you all,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded. Later, at a Statehouse reception marking the enactment of a state highway package, he won warm cheers from the legislators and contractors assembled for the event. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvucci </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> grinned but cautioned, `` Steady as she goes.''

<HEAD>One Man Shot In `Rock House' Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police have resumed the use of battering rams to bust fortified `` rock houses'' of alleged drug dealers, and one suspect was shot when he pointed a gun at officers, authorities said. L.C. <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was in surgery Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said administrative supervisor <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Delp </PERSON>. Doctors were not sure whether his arm could be saved, she said. The shooting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> occurred just after the sweep of three alleged sites of rock cocaine sales began late Wednesday, said police Officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>. `` The elderly suspect was carrying a shotgun when officers broke into the house where narcotics were being sold and pointed the weapon at them,'' <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said. `` One of our officers responded by firing his shotgun, injuring the suspect.'' <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> was arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was also arrested. She was booked for investigation of felony drug possession, <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said. Police seized a small amount of drugs, three shotguns, two pistols and a rifle in the raids, <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said. The houses had been linked to violent street gangs, <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said, but he could n't tie the suspects to a gang. The `` rock houses'' where dealers sell the type of cocaine known as `` rock'' or `` crack,'' are primarily in impoverished South-Central neighborhoods. Police began using the motorized battering ram because the metal-fortified doors and windows made it difficult to get inside to serve search warrants. Following court challenges by civil-rights groups, police must now obtain a judge's permission each time they want to use the ram.

 An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent learned how close he had come to being killed in a shootout with a polygamist clan when a .30 - caliber slug was found in his jacket during a courthouse security Agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> `` turned three ugly shades of gray'' Wednesday when the X-ray at the courthouse door found the slug in the lining of his flight jacket, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON>. `` He was shocked.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who had come to court to testify against members of the clan, took the coat to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and the slug was cut out of the lining. The slug will be compared with six spent rounds retrieved at the scene of the shootout and two .30 - caliber rifles found in the bedroom of defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> Singer, clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, matriarch <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 20, are standing trial on federal charges stemming from the Jan. 16 bombing of a Mormon chapel and 13-day standoff that ended in the shootout. Today, the jury put on headphones for the second time in the trial and watched on a television monitor a videotape of the shootout that was taken by <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Deputy <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who had been stationed 500 yards away from the Singer compound. The tape did not show any individuals running or shooting, but a sequence of 11 gunshots was heard along with the deputy's surprised reaction, `` Jesus Christ!'' The tape was a two-minute excerpt from <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' coverage of the gun battle. Summit County Detective <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Offret </PERSON>, who had testified earlier, was recalled to the stand. <PERSON> Offret </PERSON> said he was the first officer to inspect the home where the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrest team was stationed during the shootout. When he examined the site, he found five .30 - caliber bullets, a number of bullet strike marks and a 9-mm The gunbattle occurred as agents were attempting to capture the Swapp brothers with attack dogs. State Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> was killed and <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> was wounded. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had been with a team of surveillance agents stationed in the home of <PERSON> Don </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON> when a second <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> team implemented the arrest plan. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he was watching through a window when the Swapp brothers walked back to the main Singer residence from a goat pen and the order was given to release the dogs. Seconds later, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> testified, he heard a `` loud explosion of gunshot immediately in front of my face'' and felt a sharp pain in his upper chest. `` I recalled saying, ` I'm hit! I'm hit!''' Another agent jumped on <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and began searching for wounds but none was found. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> then resumed his position in front of the window, he said. No bullet marks were found on the jacket or on his body armor vest at the time, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, and he thought he had been hit by a fragment of a wall. `` It was my impression that had I been hit with a bullet, it would've penetrated the vest ... and I would not be here today,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Earlier Wednesday, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent stationed with <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON> house testified that <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> pointed a rifle at him. Agent <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> knelt in the snow and aimed, but the agent recalled seeing no muzzle flashes. `` I said to everybody, ` Get down, get down. He's shooting at us,''' <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON> said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> assured two dozen Jewish refuseniks and other Soviets with human rights complaints Thursday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his successor will champion their cause. `` It's built into us,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at a gathering at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> after listening patiently to stories of refused visas, separated families and scientists who long ago stopped doing sensitive work for the Soviet government. He also gave human rights `` the pride of place'' on his agenda, leading off with the subject at his meeting with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` I have to keep working at this, to keep striving, to never give up,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. With a quaver in his voice, he continued: `` I can promise you that the president, and whoever succeeds him _ it' built into us _ will keep working at these human rights problems.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would pursue the subject Friday with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. At about the same time that he was meeting with the refuseniks invited to the embassy, others trying to press their emigration appeals in a demonstration at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> were dragged away and taken to a police station in buses. The crackdown on an unsanctioned public protest may have been intended as a warning against such demonstrations during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit here next month Jewish emigration in March hit a 15-month high with 984 people leaving the country. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is trying to force radical changes in the way the Soviets handle applications for exit permits. He wants to ease the restriction on people who dealt with classified subjects so they could not be denied visas for work done many years in the past. And he wants the Soviets to stop permitting a family member to block another adult's visa. Chicago-born <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, was a case in point. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> will not emigrate unless his son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, and daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, are granted visas, too. But <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said her mother, from whom she is estranged, has blocked her application, and thus kept all three Stolars from leaving. As <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made his way around the living room of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul general, people stepped forward to tell their stories. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON>, whose wife is in <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> hospital in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> recovering from brain surgery, has been denied a visa for 11 years. He is an engineer who said he was last involved in sensitive work 15 years ago. `` It's absolutely a lame excuse,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told him. <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON> carried color photographs of his son, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and his grandson. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>, a mathematician who said he worked on a space program more than 17 years ago, has been refused a visa for nine years. His family lives in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheiba </PERSON>, a physicist from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, smiled and said his daughter left two days ago, but he is still waiting for a visa. `` We are all hostages,'' <PERSON> Sheiba </PERSON> said. `` We are subjects for bargaining. `` Last year, at Passover, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> attended a Jewish seder at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy Several of the guests, including pianist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltsman </PERSON>, have since left. He met two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with a group of emigres, including long-time refusenik <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Slepak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> offered their experience as a symbol of hope. `` I'd like to meet you again,'' he said. `` But not necessarily here.''

<HEAD>McMartin Mass Molestation Trial Enters Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The McMartin Preschool molestation trial started 368 days, 42 witnesses and $ 8 million ago, and attorneys say it is likely to last at least a year more. And that does n't include the 18-month preliminary hearing. `` Welcome to the year No. 2 of our trial,'' <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said Wednesday. The judge and attorneys then spent an hour renumbering photographic evidence. Since jury selection started April 20, 1987, there have been 32,134 pages of transcript logged in Pounders' courtroom. Leap year added an extra day. The prosecution, taking testimony from its 42nd witness, is expected to rest its case late this summer. The defense has said it hopes to take less than a year to present its side. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 29, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, are charged jointly with one count of conspiracy and separately with 99 counts of molestation between them. The charges center on 14 children who were under their care at the <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Charges against five other teachers were dropped in 1986. In court, there have been allegations of satanic rituals, animal butchery, perjury, suppression of evidence and coaching of witnesses. One witness was jailed for failing to show up to testify, and another committed suicide the day he was to testify. Mrs. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> is free on bail but her son remains in custody, his bail set at $ 3 million. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> has been praised for his control of the trial so far. `` I think this judge has made a difference as far as recognizing and understanding the needs of the victims,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. Six children testified during the first year of the trial. Defense attorneys claim many of their answers were coached. A 13-year-old was asked Wednesday whether the `` secret room'' where he said he was molested was actually a classroom. `` I'm leaving open the possibility, but I do n't remember it being a place where children are taught,'' the child answered. `` The kids appear to have been so prepped for trial, their testimony has been weakened,'' said attorney Dean Gits. `` There is little or no spontaneity.'' Seven children have yet to testify. The parents of the 14th alleged victim have refused to let their child take the stand.

<HEAD>California High Court Says Limit on Damages Doesn't Apply to
Pending Cases</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> dealt a multimillion-dollar setback to businesses and insurers today, ruling that the 1986 `` deep pockets'' initiative, which limited damages for pain and suffering, did not apply to cases pending when the measure passed. The 4-3 ruling was a victory for injury victims and their lawyers in cases where the harm had occurred but the lawsuits had not yet been completed by June 1986, when state voters approved Proposition 51 by a 62 percent majority. One class of cases particularly affected by today's ruling is asbestos lawsuits, many of which had been filed but not settled by June 1986. The court ruled that the initiative was constitutional, rejecting trial lawyers' claims that it discriminated unfairly against injury victims. But in the key portion of the ruling, the majority said the measure's new standards for determining non-economic damages applied only to injuries suffered after the initiative passed. The opinion by Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguelles </PERSON> cited `` the common-sense notion that it may be unfair to change the rules of the game in the middle of the contest.'' He also said new laws are generally presumed to apply only to future cases. Proposition 51, sponsored by businesses, insurers and local governments and opposed by trial lawyers, limits a defendant's share of non-economic damages _ pain, suffering and emotional distress _ to its percentage of the total fault Under the initiative, if a company that is 40 percent responsible for an injury, for example, has gone out of business by the time of suit, the victim can collect no more than 60 percent of the non-economic damages from the remaining defendants. Economic damages, such as medical costs and lost wages, are still covered by the longstanding `` deep pockets'' rule, under which one or all of the remaining defendants can be required to pay 100 percent of the costs.

 A homeless man embittered about cuts in his pension payments on Thursday seriously damaged three paintings by German master <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> <PERSON> Duerer </PERSON> by spraying them with sulfuric acid from a champagne bottle. Art restoration experts worked feverishly to save the multimillion-dollar paintings. A 51-year-old homeless pensioner turned himself in to officials at <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Alte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinakothek </LOCATION> museum after spraying sulfuric acid on the Duerer classics `` Mourning of Christ'' and the `` Paumgartner Altar,'' police said. <PERSON> Duerer </PERSON>, considered the most influential artist of the German school, painted the works between 1496 and 1504. He told police he destroyed the paintings `` out of revenge'' because of decreases in his pension payments. Deductions had been made from the man's pension to pay for similar attacks he made on paintings in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, police said. The man described himself to police as `` psychologically disturbed,'' according to police officials who asked not to be identified, citing policy. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state art administration director told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the damage done to the works was `` very distressing.'' `` The Altar alone is worth 70 million marks -LRB- about $ 40 million -RRB-. The value has sunk by at least 30 percent,'' said <PERSON> Hubertus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnenburg </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state painting collections organization. `` But in terms of art history you ca n't even assess this damage. `` The paintings can certainly be restored. But there were so many damaged areas _ one can never paint them over again so than one does n't see them,'' <PERSON> Sonnenberg </PERSON> added. Police said the pictures were as much as 70 percent destroyed. Art restoration experts from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Doerner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> rushed to the museum shortly after the 10 a.m. attack. The paintings will have to dry out for at least two months before the specialists can begin restoration work, said institute chemist <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>. The embittered pensioner was described by witnesses as a `` well-dressed gentleman'' who appeared to be just an ordinary museum visitor. A school group came upon him as he stood before the Duerer works, spraying the pictures with acid from a small champagne bottle. When a pupil cried out to stop him, the man calmly put away the bottle and turned himself in to museum officials, witnesses said.

 The 2-month-old son of a part-time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal was taken from his stroller on a city street by kidnappers who lured his mother out of her house with a phony telephone call, police said. `` We have no motive, no ransom demand, no witnesses, no nothing,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. The kidnappers of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> have not contacted the infant's family since he was taken shortly before noon Wednesday, he added. The infant's father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> police force in 1984 with a disability, and now works part-time as a guard for the marshal's office. However, investigators expressed doubt that <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s work was linked to the kidnapping. `` His work in <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> was routine police work,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. `` His work with the marshal's service is minor.'' According to police, <PERSON> Lucrezia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> received a telephone call about 1 -LCB- hours before the abduction from a woman who told her that her 7-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was ill at school. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> put <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> in his stroller and started walking toward <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ephram </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the sergeant said. Suddenly, two men in a black sedan pulled up and the passenger got out to ask for directions. `` The driver of the vehicle walked around the car, and grabbed the baby from the stroller,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. As the mother screamed, the men fled. `` Other than ask directions, they did n't say a word,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. The distraught mother failed to get the car's make or license plate number, the detective said. Investigators determined the call from the school was fake. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a 4-hour-old baby was found today after being kidnapped Wednesday night from a Prescott hospital. A woman who claimed to be a laboratory technician took the newborn from his mother's arms, authorities said. A <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION> police officer making a check of a parked car found the kidnapped infant. The baby also was the officer's godchild, police said. Two people were arrested for investigation of kidnapping, police said. `` The baby was still wearing hospital garments,'' said <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON> police Sgt. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracke </PERSON>. `` The baby's fine.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwitz </PERSON> was told Wednesday night that her son had to be taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Yavapai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s laboratory for tests, said <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> police Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Japanese Police Ask Interpol to Help Seek Red Army Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> to aid the hunt for 26 suspected members of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to try to prevent terrorist acts during the 1988 Olympics, an agency official said Thursday. A list naming the 26 was sent Wednesday to Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the list included updated portraits of seven members based on information obtained recently by the Japanese police agency. The official said police feared the revolutionary group would carry out terrorist acts inside and outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of the Olympic Games in neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said the request would help the search for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members in each of <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s 146 member nations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also plans to distribute 10,000 posters and leaflets describing the wanted members to Japanese embassies and offices of local companies abroad, including airports, the official said. He said the list includes <PERSON> Fusako </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON>, 42, suspected of masterminding the 1972 machine gun attacks at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> that killed 28 people. Police in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON> may have been involved in the explosion of a car bomb car outside a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> last week. The blast killed an American servicewoman and four Italians. <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member, also is on the international wanted list because he is suspected in the bombing, the official said. The Asahi Evening News quoted an unidentified police official as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to a news agency in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday saying it and <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> were not involved in the bombing. The police official refused comment. He said <PERSON> Takamaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamiya </PERSON>, 45, who led a hijacking of a Japanese domestic airliner to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, also is on the <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> list. <PERSON> Tamiya </PERSON> and eight other <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members hijacked an <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in September 1970 and fled to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after freeing all the passengers. News reports said one of the hijackers recently died in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> but did not give the cause of death. The Japanese police official said police were aware of a letter that <PERSON> Tamiya </PERSON> apparently sent to <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> news media last month. The letter said that the remaining members in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would `` go anywhere if ordered'' to participate in terrorist acts. The officer declined to provide further details. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has said that a Japanese arrested April 12 on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> with pipe bombs in his car also is suspected of being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is a radical leftist group formed in 1969 calling for `` simultaneous world revolution.'' It was thought to have had about 300 members at its peak. About 40 members are believed allied with pro-Palestinian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, ousted from office April 4 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, will be a delegate to the state GOP convention and hopes to be picked as one of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 33 delegates to the Republican National Convention. `` Of course,'' he replied with a smile Wednesday night when asked whether he'd expected to be sent to the state convention from his district meeting. As a precinct committeeman, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> automatically was among the 182 candidates on the ballot in his district for 38 slots at the May 14 state meeting.

<HEAD>Leading Candidates Already Looking To Debate And Second Round</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, leading candidates in the first round of the presidential election Sunday, have piqued other hopefuls by arguing over terms of a one-on-one debate. As the official campaign entered its last two days Thursday, both the 71-year-old Socialist president and his 55-year-old conservative premier already were setting their sights on the May 8 runoff. That attitude did not sit well with former center-right Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, 64, running third in the polls. `` The game is not over,'' said <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, adding he believed it was `` presumptuous, not to say curious'' for his competitors `` to set a date for a debate before the French people have decided.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, expressed the frustration of other candidates: `` The day before yesterday, yesterday and today, one question occupies the radio and television commentaries: the Mitterrand-Chirac debate between the first and second rounds.'' `` In other words, the first round is already over,'' said <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>, whose party's candidate is <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>. French elections are run in two rounds. If, as expected, no candidate wins an absolute majority Sunday, the two top vote-getters face each other in a runoff. Under French law, no polls are allowed to be published in the week immediately preceding an election. The last polls showed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> with comfortable lead at about 35 percent to 37 percent, followed by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> with 22 percent to 24 percent. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> is third with about 17 percent and extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> has 12 percent. There are five other candidates in the first round. The polls vary widely, and some show as much as 20 percent of the vote undecided. As the campaign for the first round drew to a close, discussion focused on the date and format for an eventual debate. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he thought Thursday of next week would be fine but added any confrontation involving a president and a premier should be dignified. On Thursday, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s proposed debate date and preferred `` the beginning of the second week'' between the two rounds. `` It is not for one candidate to set the date and summon the other,'' the premier said. `` This debate must occur at a moment when the French people are really mobilized.'' Responding with thick irony, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he was very open about the date, but at the moment, he had nobody to talk to. `` I must address myself to the different candidates who could be present in the second round,'' he said. `` That is a difficult conversation to have seriously before Sunday night.'' The polls indicated <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would defeat either <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> or Barre in the second round, though the gap was narrowing. A televised debate, which has become a tradition in presidential politics, is vastly more important to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who hopes it will help him gain ground. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has much more to lose and must avoid a serious gaffe. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, head of the conservative Rally for the Republic party, is a tough debater. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> no doubt has not forgotten how <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> ran roughshod over former Socialist Premier <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON> in a televised debate before the 1986 legislative elections. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> says he does n't want an American-style debate with the two men questioned separately by a panel of journalists. He wants a head-on confrontation. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would prefer a less direct method. Analysts have called the presidential campaign lackluster and without any real discussion of the issues. Candidates have spoken about `` priorities'' and `` general orientations,'' but none of them has proposed any refreshing new ideas on how to tackle <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s economic and social problems <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is seeking a second seven-year term in the <LOCATION> Elysee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who also served as premier from 1974-76 under President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, is making his second run for the presidency. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> as <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON>'s premier, is running for the first time. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> in the presidential election May 10, 1981. On Friday the two-week `` official campaign'' ends. During that period, each candidate has a specifically allotted amount of time on radio and television, and campaign meetings intensify. No political advertising is allowed on radio and television. On Saturday before the election, no campaigning is permitted. There are 38.3 million eligible voters.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still in the dark regarding the whereabouts of the nine hijackers who killed two passengers aboard a Kuwaiti plane before releasing the hostages, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in touch with the government of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, where the hijacking ended Wednesday, as well as with Kuwaiti authorities. Most of the 31 hostages were Kuwaitis, and the hijackers had demanded the release of 17 prisoners held by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for terrorist bombings. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not know whether a deal was struck with the hostages. `` We remain unaware of specific arrangements which were worked out to lead to the end of the hijacking,'' she said. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> reportedly agreed to commute the death sentences of three of the 17 Moslems whose released was being demanded by the hijackers in return for the hostages' release. The hijackers were reportedly flown to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know where the hijackers are. We remain in touch with the government of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on this matter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We are also in touch with a number of governments that share our concerns about bringing terrorists to justice.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not rest until the terrorists, the murderers, the hijackers are brought to justice. Our objective is to make sure they do not go unpunished,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is examining the possibility of filing charges against the hijackers because one of the hostages holds dual U.S.-Egyptian citizenship.

<HEAD>Farmers ``Adopt'' Scientists To Show Them Where Research Is Used</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calcott </PERSON> will leave his test tubes behind this summer to help feed hogs on a farm as part of a nationwide program to introduce scientists to the farmers they help. The reason for the pilot program, dubbed `` Adopt-a-Scientist,'' is that many scientists have never seen a farm and `` for all they know, cotton grows in pots,'' says <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Calcott </PERSON> is one of eight researchers from agricultural products companies who will be matched with farmers across the country. `` We hope he gets ideas and sees the needs out here in the country,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, whose farm <PERSON> Calcott </PERSON> will visit. `` We want him to see what we do so he'll know how vital his research is.'' Scientists will also be visiting farms in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and perhaps other states. The farmers, in turn, may visit the scientists' labs to get a better understanding of how technology can help them, said <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, assistant director of the Natural and Environmental Resources Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> raise corn and soybeans, but the main enterprise on their 240-acre <LOCATION> Randolph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farm is hogs. Calcott works at <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> on improving swine nutrition and getting hogs to market weight more efficiently. `` I am a scientist _ involved all my life in laboratory work _ and I do n't really have any on-farm experience with animals,'' said <PERSON> Calcott </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> who has taught biochemistry and molecular biology at universities. `` I want to understand issues that are important to the <LOCATION> Meyers </LOCATION> _ what improvements they need.'' The scientists will be visiting at crucial times such as planting and harvest. `` Farmers notice every little thing and they will point out anything strange like a bug on a leaf _ and, sure enough it turns out to be something new,'' said <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>. `` They can turn on a lightbulb for the scientists.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said she and her husband would show <PERSON> Calcott </PERSON> how they raise corn and soybeans _ two important ingredients in livestock rations _ and how they care for their hogs. `` We'll make him one of the family, and he'll do some of the work,'' she said. `` We're excited about this. We just need a better understanding among all of us in agriculture.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> today ordered two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn operators to pay fines totaling $ 1.2 million for failing to restrict access of obscene messages to children and nonconsenting adults. `` It's time we took steps. The ultimate in sleaze deserves the ultimate ... penalty,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON>. `` They need to know we mean business.'' The companies, <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, were each fined $ 600,000 for violation of statues banning the interstate transmission of obscene material and failure to restrict such transmissions from minors and nonconsenting adults. The maximum fine is $ 50,000 for each day of violation. An <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, said the $ 600,000 fines were based on the amount of money the companies made during the commission's monitoring process. In an 11-month period, <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> made $ 650,000 off calls to one line, the spokesman said. Today's order resulted from an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> investigation triggered by complaints alleging that unimpeded access to the messages resulted in the molestation of one 10-year-old girl and so disturbed one teen he had to enter weekly psychiatric therapy. The companies have 30 days to pay or seek reduction of the fine. Earlier commission dial-a-porn rules had mandated the `` blocking'' of such messages through access codes, message scrambling or use of credit card numbers. Upon being notified last December of the complaints, both companies said they did not have the capacity to provide access screening and denied the messages were obscene. <PERSON> Intercambio </PERSON> also argued that it had not violated the regulation because it never intended to transmit interstate or to minors. The commission staff is investigating complaints about two other dial-a-porn companies, <ORGANIZATION> Ramrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and 2001 Enterprises.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said Thursday the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> will force <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to change its hardline communist policy and reopen a dialogue with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> changes its longstanding policy to make the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> communist through military force, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would move actively to improve relations. `` The Olympics are dictating changes in the situation of this part of the world, and I, therefore, believe that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s policy would also inevitably change,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a nationally televised news conference <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said relations would reach an `` epochal turning point'' in four or five years, and said he hoped he could lay a firm foundation for unification. Despite the November bombing of a South Korean civilian airliner in an attack <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> blamed on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> have been talking and must keep channels open, he said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who took office Feb. 25, did not say what channels the two Korean states were using for dialogue. But he said, `` The most effective way to solve problems is summit talks.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, proposed a summit with North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il-sung </PERSON> on many occasions, but the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government turned him down. The Korean peninsula was divided into communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and anti-communist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1945 at the end of World War II. They fought a bloody civil war from 1950 to 1953. They have held intermittent talks since the early 1970s. Their latest dialogue was broken off in 1986 when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> disputed a major joint <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> military exercise. Relations took another nosedive last November when a Korean Air jetliner disappeared near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, killing all 115 people on board. A North Korean agent in the custody of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> intelligence authorities confessed in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in January that she and a male agent put a time bomb on the plane to disrupt the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> deplored the bombing, but said his government still needs to promote dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to avoid a `` possibly more tragic incident.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also said increasing violence in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections would be suppressed. `` Whoever violates the law and destroys <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> order must be punished severely in the name of people,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said his governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> needs a majority in the 299-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in elections next Tuesday. Top opposition leaders have said that if the party tries to rig the elections, they will call for violent protests similar to those in June that forced democratic reforms. `` The ruling party will face popular resistence and disobedience if its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. Rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said he would have to make a `` grave decision'' if the government cheated. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected in December when the two Kims split the opposition vote. Corruption and violence are among major campaign issues in the legislative elections, the first test of public confidence in the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. Government officials say 15 people have been arrested for involvement in campaign violence, including six members of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s party Another 120 people were charged but not jailed for violating election laws, they said. In keeping with a campaign pledge, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> publicly declared his personal wealth at $ 693,000. The president also said he would lead a clean public life during his single five-year term and would not tolerate any attempts by his relatives to sell influence or make an illicit fortune during his tenure.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accepted defeat in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as he has accepted his wins and losses in other states _ graciously and with a call for Democratic unity. He praised the campaign of the winner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and said that during the rest of the primary season there must be `` a measure of competition, a measure of cooperation'' as the Democrats `` keep our eyes on the bigger prize'' _ victory in the November general election. It was consistent with the high-toned campaign <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has carefully crafted, in which he has stayed above the fray, even during the past week when under attack by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. His demeanor has been noticed within the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> where once he was considered a polarizing force. `` I think Democrats all over the country are giving <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> high marks for his conduct during the campaign,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, who managed Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s presidential campaign until the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman dropped out last month. In fact, <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has had a unifying effect on the race. `` From the very beginning of the year, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has tried to keep to the high road. He has not been critical. It's been a deliberate conscious effort,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1988 stands in contrast to the candidate who in earlier years attacked Democratic party rules as exclusionary, alienated Jewish voters and cavorted around the world grabbing the spotlight by meeting with controversial figures including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` In his earlier years he obviously was a protester. This time he has grown tremendously and has grown into the protecter of the high road,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, who was a member of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s inner circle. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said many Democratic leaders had commented to her about `` how tough it must have been not to respond'' to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s assertions that Jews `` would have to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s allegation that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lied about his proximity to Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> when <PERSON> King </PERSON> was slain in 1968. `` There's a real appreciation that he held back,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. And in fact, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> discussed it, she said. `` He said that it was hard but he knew he was doing the right thing,'' and that he had told her more than a year ago that he was determined not to engage in negative campaigning. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did say, `` Some people are making hysteria while I'm making history.'' The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> strategy, aimed at putting a Democrat in the White House in November, also is devised to make <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a party insider rather than the outsider he was in 1984. `` It's very important to him and his participation in the campaign to be seen as a positive force for the party,'' <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said he saw a `` maturation process over the last four years,'' and said that because of the way <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has conducted himself he is considered a major player in party politics by the other major players. In debates among the Democratic contenders, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has relished the role of the peacemaker as some of his rivals squabbled. He has insisted that Democrats should aim their fire at the Republicans, and frequently contends internal party wrangling cost them the White House in previous elections. Even after the Super Tuesday contests across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had reason to gloat after pulling the most votes and polling second in the delegate count, he put in a plug for party unity. He called on what was then a hefty field of Democratic contenders not to `` self destruct'' by attacking one another. Not only does <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refrain from attacking his opponents, he regularly telephones them, said campaign manager <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. `` There's a kind of camaraderie that exists,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pledges that, as he did in 1984, he will work hard for the Democratic ticket even if he is not on it. That would stand him in good stead down the road, especially if a Democratic administration takes over. `` He's doing all the right things for his future,'' <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> commented that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, at 46, is still a young man, and `` he's going to be around for a long time.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, five weeks before meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not have `` a normal relationship'' unless <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> changes its ways and stops interfering in nations such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a wide-ranging speech on U.S.-Soviet ties, listed a variety of concerns for both superpowers, including arms control, the famine ravaging <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the peace process in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. On arms control, the president urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, signed at the last U.S.-Soviet summit, before he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meet May 29 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He spoke hours after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wo n't rush to ratify the treaty despite <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pressure to do so by the summit. The treaty is not scheduled to go to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor until May 9. Later, in a question-and-answer session with his audience at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that it would be `` very upsetting and would put a strain on the summit if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not ratified the treaty by the time we go'' to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We hope and pray that they will, but their scheduling of it has been such that I am very concerned we may have to go without having had it ratified,'' he said. But, the president added, `` We do n't want a fast treaty. We want a good one.'' As for relations with a nation <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once labeled `` the evil empire,'' he said in his speech that `` the next few months will be no time for complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves.'' The president said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can build trust only when it stops interfering in other nations and improves its record of human rights. `` Our policy is intended to nurture what you might call more normal relations between East and West,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said that a Soviet Union that tramples on the rights of its own people `` can never have truly normal relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the rest of the free world. `` Neither can a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is always trying to push its way into other countries ever have a normal relationship with us.'' Taking a positive note, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said U.S.-Soviet relations `` have taken a dramatic turn, into a period of realistic engagement. ... The INF treaty is now a reality and now the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should give its consent to ratification.'' He added that progress has been made on limiting strategic weapons as well. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned that on regional issues, such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he wants to see deeds, not just words. `` They have often promised to leave -LRB- a country, -RRB- but rarely in their history, and then only under pressure from the West, have they actually done it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes that the Soviets `` still hope to prop up their discredited, doomed puppet regime, and they still seek to pose a threat to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, to whom we have a longstanding defense commitment.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it was n't clear whether the Soviets have planned to give up such ambitions, but that `` We must make clear that any spreading of violence on the part of the Soviets or their puppets could undo the good'' that was promised by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> pact outlining the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The president reminded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that unless he keeps his promise to withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will stand by its `` hard and fast commitment'' to support the Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also demanded that the Soviets deal strongly with their allies in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and help food reach the hundreds of thousands of starving there. `` They can stop this disaster before it happens,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, appealing to the Soviets to persuade the Ethiopian government to allow the international famine relief effort to continue despite the ongoing civil war in that Northern African nation. As for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> criticized both the Soviets and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He accused the Soviets helped the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in `` stealing a democratic revolution.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he charged, had `` denied the freedom fighters the support they need'' to force the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to keep their promises of democracy. Back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, addressing the INF treaty, told reporters: `` We want a good treaty, that is our objective. ... `` I'm not going to rush to judgment.'' He said a continuing dispute over whether the new treaty bans such futuristic weapons as those using laser rays or particle beam generators must be resolved before the treaty can be considered. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he had discussed the issue of futuristic weapons with Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who reported verbally on the panel's findings He said he had asked <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to report more fully in writing. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has said in a letter to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that the Soviets agree with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the treaty bans futuristic weapons. On Wednesday, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that failure to ratify the treaty before the summit could `` tend to dampen'' prospects for progress at the summit on a long-range missile accord. The White House spokesman nudged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to speed up the process as a parliamentary commission in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday approved the treaty, setting the stage for Soviet ratification before the summit. To have the INF treaty signed before the summit `` would be an important boost to our negotiations'' on strategic weapons, he said. `` Similarly, if it's not signed, it would tend to dampen, I think, the prospects for serious ... progress'' on a strategic weapons treaty, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. `` It would not be helpful and we would hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be able to ratify it before we go.'' Even if the INF treaty is ratified, administration officials doubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing at the summit. The INF treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, but some senators have questioned how the pact would affect weapons in that range that could be developed in the future. Once the treaty is on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, the agreement likely will encounter stalling tactics from Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and other foes.

 The pro-Iranian kidnappers of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said Thursday the Marine officer will be tried on charges of spying for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This criminal will be turned over today to the tribunal of the oppressed to try him for the crimes he has committed,'' the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said in a typewritten statement delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency office. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was serving with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was abducted by gunmen Feb. 17 near the ancient port of Tyre, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The statement came three days after the Christian-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio station claimed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed during clashes between pro-Syrian and Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militias in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> earlier this month. It could not be known whether Thursday's communique was meant to refute the radio report or set the stage for announcing <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death Thursday's Arabic-language statement from the Shiite Moslem group was accompanied by a black-and-white photograph of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, apparently to prove its authenticity. The picture showed the balding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> with a stubbled gray beard, wearing a dark field jacket, his eyes looking down and away from the camera. It was the first photograph of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> released by his captors since his kidnapping. It was not known when it was taken. The statement said among the charges <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> faced was `` spying for the criminal <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on our Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> peoples'' and `` active participation in American conspiracies against our Moslem people.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> supervised a `` Pentagon team to combat Lebanese and Palestinian Islamic organizations in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have previously denied earlier charges by the kidnappers that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was spying for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, said the kidnappers' latest charge `` is of course nonsense. `` Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is not a spy. He was working for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a peaceful mission and we hold his hostage holders responsible for his safety,'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> told `` CBS This Morning.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said a `` so-called trial'' of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> `` can bring only further discredit to the terrorists and their cause. `` The notion that the Organization for the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> ... has the right to try anyone is simply grotesque,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the statement alleged, provided the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with `` his personal views on the situation -LRB- in the south -RRB-, which include all military activities in resisting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and ways of bringing them under control.'' It claimed he was a member of what it called an American coordination committee `` on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and Palestine'' made up of officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The kidnappers released a videotape Feb. 22 in which the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and onetime aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> asked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to meet demands for his release. The kidnappers have demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from an occupied enclave in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the release of all Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration has refused to intervene with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over the captors' demands and said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' plea was made under duress. Thursday's statement was the fourth from the group since it claimed Feb. 19 that it had kidnapped him. Also Thursday, the wife of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage, <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, sent him her good wishes for his 49th birthday in an advertisement published by the independent An-Nahar daily. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was a communications instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped on Jan. 24 last year. `` Dearest <PERSON> Alann </PERSON>,'' said the published note from <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who also works at the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> college. `` We love you dearly. We keep working and hoping with others that you will be with us again soon.'' There are nine Americans among the 22 foreigners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Held the longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military said today that unidentified intruders broke into an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military fuel storage area near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> for the third time in two weeks. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not know if sentries guarding the <ORGANIZATION> Arraijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> near <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> exchanged fire with intruders Wednesday night. `` They are still being debriefed, and I do n't have any details myself,'' <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON> said he did not believe there were any injuries in the incident. A Marine was killed in the first reported intrusion on April 11 when he was shot by fellow guards. <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON> said the 807-acre tank farm, about five miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was being guarded by members of the 193rd <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The soldiers replaced the Marines after the second reported intrusion last week. In that incident, the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> said they engaged in a two-hour firefight with what they said were between 40 and 50 men dressed in black uniforms. The Marines involved in the first two break-ins had arrived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> only the week before from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, as part of a 1,300-man <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military build-up. The Panamanian government ridiculed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounts of the alleged intrusions, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> had fired at `` swaying palm trees'' and shadows. It later filed a diplomatic protest over the incidents. The Southern Command still has not released a report of its investigation into last week's incidents, but a source close to the probe said it turned up `` no conclusive evidence.'' The source, however, said small electronic sensors scattered over the hilly, jungled reserve had detected the presence of intruders, which tended to confirm the visual sightings reported by the Marines. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early last week that the intruders appeared to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. The Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under criminal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, along with civilian opponents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has been seeking the general's ouster for months. On Wednesday, the government revoked a month-old state of emergency that curbed civil liberties after rebel soldiers attempted to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The National Assembly voted to revoke the emergency decree at the request of acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, a local television broadcast said. There was no immediate comment from the government. The `` state of urgency'' permitted the Noriega-controlled government to suspend a wide range of civil liberties, including freedom of speech and assembly and the right to private property. The government invoked the decree on March 18, two days after dissident officers tried to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> but failed and were captured A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military official said four high-ranking <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military officers would visit <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McNair </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> next week. High-ranking members of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s staff are seldom accessible to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. In another development, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, ousted as vice president by pro-Noriega lawmakers along with then-president <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, appealed to Latin American governments to support efforts to oust the general. In a letter released Wednesday, he said: `` We hope that the Latin American democracies will raise their voice without euphemisms, show solidarity and help Panamanians to break up this dangerous dictatorship.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the nation's president In February, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He has since successfully resisted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and an opposition campaign aimed at forcing him out of office.

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> is heavily favored to win the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. If he does, his problems have just started. The nominee will be going against the well-known and well-heeled <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and against tradition. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> has not sent a Democrat to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> won in 1962. <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> city controller, is the best-financed of the four Democratic candidates and has the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Potter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kefover </PERSON> is his only active opponent, but she has raised barely more than $ 5,000. <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON>'s campaign raised $ 133,352 between January and April The other two candidates are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Villanova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and economic consultant <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nomination in 1982, bills himself as the only Democrat who can beat <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>. He says he seeks to `` promote world peace, to protect the environment and to lower the budget and trade deficits.'' <PERSON> Kefover </PERSON> says people have lost faith in government. `` We have to start giving more control back to local government officials _ to help bring that confidence back and get us all back in shape,'' she said during a recent campaign stop in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, 36, ran unsuccessfully in the 1986 gubernatorial primary and was supported by the organization of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, the political extremist who had sought the presidency. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, whose campaign had $ 1.8 million on hand as of April 6 compared to $ 48,013 for <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON>, has no primary opposition. A Heinz-Vignola race would shape up as a rerun of the 1986 race between Republican Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>. In both cases, the Democrat is a liberal from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> making his first run for statewide office against an incumbent moderate Republican who is better known and better financed. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> won 57 percent of the vote against <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>. Workers in the <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> campaigns said they knew of no public opinion polls that had been taken before the primary. <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON>'s aides acknowledged that any voter preference poll would likely show that their candidate is not yet widely recognized in the western half of the state, a common problem for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> candidates. <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> is already campaigning against <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, with lines such as: `` We need a senator to represent the people on Main Street in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, not Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, heir to 57 varieties of money from the Pittsburgh-based pickle packing company, served two terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, then poured $ 2.9 million of his own money to win his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in 1976. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> has been silent during the campaign, but his aides sprang to his defense when <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> voted against a highway contruction bill important to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s turnpike improvement program. <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> was one of 17 senators who voted against the bill, which ultimately was vetoed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. However, the records show <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> was not among the 17 who voted `` nay'' March 19, 1987. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> was absent because his plane from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was delayed, aides said. He had a notation placed in the official record that he supported the bill.

<HEAD>Karpov Assured of Share of SWIFT Chess Title</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former world chess champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> was assured of at least a share of the SWIFT World Cup Tournament title on Thurslday when Briton <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> drew an adjourned game. With one round remaining, <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> has 10 -LCB- points out of a possible 15. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and Soviet <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Salov </PERSON> are tied with 9 -LCB- points. Another Soviet, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliavsky </PERSON>, is fourth with nine points. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, who did not play Thursday, is widely expected to agree quickly to a draw in his last-round game with Swede <PERSON> Ulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> on Friday to finish alone in first place and take the $ 20,000 first prize. Even if <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> were to lose Friday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salov </PERSON> could only tie for first place. A win scores one point and a draw a half. In the first of the adjourned games completed on Thursday, Dutchman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> maneuvered in an endgame for two hours before agreeing to a draw. A second unfinished game between Soviet <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> was drawn after only a few minutes play. <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>, the third-ranked player in the world, moved up to 10th place in the 17-man competition. `` In many ways, the standings here reflect the situation in world chess. The Soviets are leading with an Englishman second,'' said <PERSON> Gennadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosonko </PERSON>, a Dutch grandmaster. At the 1986 Chess Olympiad _ the world team championship _ the Soviets came in first with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> second and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> third. The $ 104,000 SWIFT tournament is the first of six events spread over two years that make up the inaugural Chess World Cup. Organized by the 2-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Grandmasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the events feature the world's top 25 players and a prize fund of $ 1.2 million. Each of the 25 grandmasters will play four of the six tournament and their best three finishes will make up their final standing. World Champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> did not compete in the SWIFT tournament. He opens his World Cup campaign in <LOCATION> Belfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, in June.

 <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign soared on Super Tuesday on March 8, when he scored primary victories in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> as well as his home state of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. But he was never able to capitalize on his Southern success when the campaign turned to the <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> and Northern states. When he got only 10 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary vote on Tuesday, he decided to pull the plug. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> entered the race bidding to emerge as the type of moderate Southern candidate who could permit the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to capture Southern states in the fall election. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> aside, virtually his only campaign success came in his native region. `` I lost this race and that is a big disappointment,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said as his wife <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> and other members of his family stood by his side. `` But some things matter to me more than winning. Helping my party, serving my country, knowing when to keep fighting and knowing when I've been licked.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during his campaign, according to a count by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. His decision to suspend rather than formally quit the campaign means they can attend the convention. Had he decided to withdraw, his delegates would have been divided between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the clear <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner after beating <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said today the party's runner-up after the primaries wo n't necessarily be the vice presidential choice. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, conceding `` things did n't turn out exactly as I planned,'' suspended his campaign but said he would hang on to the delegates he's won so far. `` I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. The only man I want to stop is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and we're going to stop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, bringing applause from supporters at a news conference in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office building. `` Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination but only to enable my delegates to go to the convention so they can represent our point of view in our party's deliberations,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in the campaign, `` I was doing great until I turned 40.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, brushed aside surveys suggesting he faces an uphill fight in next week's primary in that state. `` I do not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told cheering supporters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s decision to merely suspend his campaign followed a similar action by Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> earlier. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were campaigning today in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where 178 Democratic delegates are at stake on Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was going on to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which holds its primary a week later. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, asked about a potential running mate during an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it's pretty well in hand.'' Some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers were beginning to float the idea of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a possible running mate if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were the nominee. `` There would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,'' campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said such a ticket was unlikely. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, in comments published in today's <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Only once in 19 elections since the turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed second and asked him to run. It was 1960.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself said, `` If I were to finish second, it would n't entitle me to anything more than consideration, period. He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer questions about the vice presidency away from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The nominee makes that decision _ as he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- himself said. And rightly so,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued his march to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 delegates needed to nominate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was endorsed Wednesday by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only remaining competitor is <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has all but halted his campaign. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s suspension of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign earlier this month drew fire from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who complained bitterly about the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' senator's decision to keep a lock on delegates that would otherwise have gone to him. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosage </PERSON> brushed aside talk of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as vice president. `` We're still running for president,'' he said. `` There are significant primaries to come.'' And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself gave no indication he's giving up his drive for the nomination. `` We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,'' he told an enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> rally. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was also picking up the endorsement today of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, in concert with the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, suggested this week that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a 3-1 lead in the state. Even so, `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can win,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. Financial reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> indicated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had his best fund-raising month ever in March, raising $ 2.8 million. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose campaign has been well bankrolled all along, raised $ 3.4 million during the same period. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stops in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> today ranged from a high school to a labor rally to a homeless shelter. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading for <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> tonight, after spending a day in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> following the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, at a Democratic dinner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in his home state. `` I expect the campaign will be converted to an intelligent, civilized exchange of opinions,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is comfortably ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the delegate count, getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional `` super delegates.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count gives <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 1,063.15; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 841.1; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, out of 2,081 needed to nominate. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was doing his best to dampen any talk of inevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as `` the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he grinned but quickly cautioned: `` Steady as she goes.'' In one respect, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was behaving as if he were the nominee, focusing attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is all but certain to carry the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> banner in the fall. `` I'm a doer,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday, saying that characteristic stands in `` sharp contrast to the Republican nominee.''

<TEXT>
 A convicted sheep-rustler with a cowboy's grudge against rules and regulations won a gaming license Thursday for a tiny rural casino. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 57, was approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a six-month temporary license to run two slot machines and a blackjack game at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in the isolated town of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Commission Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who inherited a one-sixth interest in the club from his mother, that he would have to adhere to tough gaming regulations. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> he would be wearing two hats: `` One is your cowboy hat and one is your gaming hat.'' He added that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> must follow the rules even though he's in a remote area. Commissioner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> his application was `` a refreshing break from the others we had to read.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had told the commission's investigative arm, the state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, that he had many conflicts with brand inspectors, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and other regulatory agencies. Sometimes, he said, he pleaded guilty just to get out of courts and back to the hills. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he spent 10 months in prison in 1962 for rustling. He said he had hauled another rancher's sheep out of an area where they were interfering with a camp he was running, and simply released them elsewhere. `` I'm still looking for those sheep,'' joked Commissioner <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who grew up in the same central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> area.

 The capital's worst dust storm in 36 years shut down <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s airport for several hours Thursday while pedestrians used surgical masks and scarves to protect themselves from the swirling yellow soil. The storms began April 2 and have continued intermittently since, sometimes limiting visibility to a few hundred yards and turning the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> sky, already gray from coal dust, to a chalky yellow. `` The last time <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had such bad weather was 1952,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tingfu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. High winds carrying tons of the soil called loess swirl into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> every spring from the arid plateaus northwest of the capital. The storms have lessened in recent years due to anti-erosion measures, such as planting thousands of trees to form a `` green wall'' north of the city. But a lack of rain in <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> province in northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> aggravated the problem. The airport has been forced to close at least twice due to poor visibility. Cars, buildings and sidewalks were coated with fine dust, which also seeped into homes and offices.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said today he would suspend his campaign for the 1988 Democratic nomination and said he would do `` everything I can'' to elect a Democrat as the next president. In a graceful exit, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he would technically remain a candidate to permit his delegates to attend the Democratic National Convention. But, he said in room crowded with supporters, `` I want no part of a stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or a stop <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> movement. The only man I want to stop is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and we're going to stop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> exited with a joke after a failed campaign that he said lasted 10 months and a million miles. `` I was doing great until I turned 40,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s withdrawal leaves only front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as active candidates for the Democratic nomination. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign soared on Super Tuesday on March 8, when he scored primary victories in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> as well as his home state of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

His decision to suspend rather than formally quit the campaign means they can attend the convention. Had he decided to withdraw, his delegates would have been divided between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent his final hours as an active candidate trying to retire his huge debt. He went to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a $ 1,000-a-person fund-raiser to pay off some of the more than $ 1.5 million in debts the campaign has run up. Arriving in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told reporters, `` I'm in the midst now of consulting with friends and supporters all over the country and asking for their advice on how we can best continue the cause for which I have been fighting.'' At the dinner, he did not say whether he would withdraw. But his speech had the sound of a last hurrah. `` I have learned from my opponents. I believe they have learned from me,'' he said. And he talked about turning attention to the general election. `` These next few weeks will be a time for unity and a time to look forward to the fall election,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator praised both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has `` reclaimed our party's passion for social justice'' and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has `` shown a steady hand through a long and trying campaign.'' `` They are both good men and formidable candidates,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s strategy for winning the nomination was unusual and ultimately unsuccessful. He skipped the opening <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, where his message as `` a raging moderate'' was not well-received. Then his campaign waffled on how much of an effort to make in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ where his issue positions found a receptive audience. By the time the money was poured into the <ORGANIZATION> Granite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, it was too late to affect the outcome and he finished fifth in a seven-man field. `` I always felt like, if anybody could pass up <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, he could,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` That he was an exception to the unwritten rule that you had to play in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> proclaimed that he would `` jump-start'' his campaign in his home region on March 8, the Super Tuesday when every Southern and border state but one held primaries. He did well that day, but so did <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, splintering the political benefits of the massive regional primary. After that, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> could not find a place to make a stand. He skipped <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, but then put a chunk of money into <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, where he once again finished behind the two front-runners. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was his last stand.

 Health care workers with AIDS are nearly twice as likely as other AIDS patients to have contracted the disease through `` undetermined'' means, federal health officials said Thursday. They added, however, that the occupational risk to such workers remains small. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that 2,586 health care workers are known to be among the more than 50,000 Americans who have contracted AIDS. Health care workers make up 5.4 percent of the known <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS patients and also make up a similar percentage of the population at large _ 5.7 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. But while only 2.8 percent of the nation's other AIDS patients are classified as having gotten the disease in an `` undetermined'' manner, nearly twice as many of the health care workers with AIDS fall into no known risk group _ 5.3 percent, or 135 in all. Reasons for the higher number of `` undetermined'' cases among health care workers are unknown, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Those reasons could include failure to disclose homosexual behavior, drug abuse or other risk factors, `` the occupational risk of -LRB- AIDS -RRB- infection as a result of blood exposure, or both.'' The disease most often strikes homosexual men and injectible drug abusers, and also is spread less frequently through heterosexual contact or blood transfusions. Failure to disclose behavior which might have put them at risk is something researchers consider when looking at `` all AIDS patients with undetermined risk ... both health care workers and non-health care workers,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberland </PERSON>, a CDC AIDS specialist. `` Or, we may be seeing some occupational transmission in the health care setting,'' she said. `` It's difficult to establish with certainty how transmission occurred.'' Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health care workers who have AIDS were infected outside their job, but `` a small number of health-care workers have been infected ... through occupational exposures,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted in its weekly report. More than a dozen health care workers are documented to have become infected with the virus that causes AIDS as a result of their work _ usually by accidentally being pricked by a contaminated needle. One health care worker is known to have gone on to develop the deadly disease itself after he was infected in such a manner. Scientific studies have shown that the chance of being infected after a needle-stick exposure to blood from infected patients is less than 1 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That data has not changed at all -LRB- in continuing studies -RRB-,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chamberland </PERSON> said. `` The risk is still regarded as low, and it's most closely associated with inoculation with -LRB- tainted -RRB- blood, either in a needle-stick or in a cut with a sharp object. The number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is 59,491, including 33,280 cases in which the person has died, according to statistics this week from the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>.

No one at this time can prove who ordered the laying the of the mines _ or why.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s analysis was contained in a speech he will deliver Friday morning to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Forum, a private group. A text of the speech was released Thursday evening. White House spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, asked for comment, said, `` I do n't usually engage in debates over speeches.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, officials said there would be no comment until they had read <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s speech. `` We may have shot ourselves in the foot,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. `` Our restrained policy in the gulf worked superbly until now. We had shown sufficient force to convince <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to back off, without reacting so bloodily as to generate the ` martyrs' that the -LRB- Iranian -RRB- radicals use to inflame public passions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces on Monday destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> after a mine believed laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was struck by the frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> on April 14. Ten sailors were injured and the ship suffered hull damage. After the platforms were destroyed, Iranian ships and planes attacked <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> responded by sinking or damaging six Iranian ships. The action won wide praise and support on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, both from Republicans and Democrats. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> had not commented, but he previously been a supporter of administration gulf policy. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, after the fighting, said, `` We've taken this action to make certain the Iranians have no illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior. We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke it.'' But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said more U.S.-Iran confrontations may lie ahead. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships had previously destroyed Iranian oil platforms last Oct. 19 in retaliation for Iranian mine-laying efforts. Those strikes came after an Iranian ship, the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ajar, was caught by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> while laying mines. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Monday that mines in the area where the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was damaged `` were from the same series of those found on the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ajar, leaving no doubt the mines were sown by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> asserted that the regime of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` re-evaluated its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy in January'' and decided not to confront the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> any more. `` There is good reason to suspect that some irate -LRB- Iranian -RRB- radicals decided to light a fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It would not take more than a handful of Revolutionary Guards to drop some mines in the gulf sea lanes,'' he said. `` They could expect that if an American ship hit one, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would retaliate and they could return to the glorious confrontational days of yore.'' `` If this theory is correct, the radicals have won,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` With this week's shoot-up in the gulf, the regime's policy of declaring victory and then turning its back on the gulf has failed. It can not ignore the American presence now.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed an agreement on mutual cooperation Thursday, formalizing ties established during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The memorandum was signed simultaneously in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Describing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as `` the friendliest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has ever known,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the five-year agreement formalized ad hoc arrangements developed in the past few years. The memorandum formalizes the two nations' consultative groups, which meet periodically to discuss joint military and security assistance as well as economic development issues. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, who attended the signing ceremony in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, hinted at disagreements between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government over current <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace efforts. `` Peace is as vital for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security as military and economic strength and we will continue to work with all the states in this region to achieve that objective,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative to convene an international peace conference and speed up negotiations leading to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule, and, later, a permanent peace settlement. Relations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> drew close after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> became <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s major supplier of arms after other Western arms-producing countries refused to sell weapons to the Jewish state. In 1973, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> airlifted weapons and ammunition to a beleaguered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> caught off guard when <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> lauched a surprise attack. Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, civilian and military aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has grown to $ 3 billion and ties have grown closer. In 1981, the two countries signed a secret agreement on strategic cooperation which included provisions for military trade and joint planning. In 1985, an economic accord was signed lifting trade barriers between the two countries. In recent years, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has become a port of call for ships of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mediterranean fleet and has provided the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with land for a transmitter to beam <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said Thursday his `` Speaking Out'' is no `` kiss and tell'' book, as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has called it.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Thursday he would push for black participation in Cabinet-level policymaking and on the electoral college that selects the president. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> aides called the proposals, outlined in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, a major reform initiative, but they fell far short of black demands for full voting rights and abolition of apartheid legislation. The increasingly powerful, far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes any concessions to blacks, assailed the speech. The Conservatives' <PERSON> Koos </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to resign and said the president's `` colossal lack of political credibility'' had made him an object of ridicule among his fellow Afrikaners. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s proposals appeared unlikely to ease international pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for an end to apartheid, which establishes racially segregated neighborhoods, hospitals and schools, gives the 5 million whites almost total political control and deprives the 26 million blacks of a vote in national affairs. But domestically, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s message was that his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would not back off from slow-paced reform despite the Conservatives' victories in three recent parliamentary by-elections. `` If the white people do not wish to follow my way, it is their responsibility,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` If they follow the way of confrontation, it is their problem.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s proposal to include blacks in the electoral college would, if implemented, mark the first time that blacks had a direct voice in the selection of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s president. He gave no details about how many seats blacks might have in the college, which has 88 members, 50 of them from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suggested that a Cabinet-level `` executive authority'' be opened to people not serving in Parliament. This would clear the way for participation in policymaking by blacks, who are excluded from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also reiterated his longstanding proposal for creation of a national advisory council on which he and top Cabinet ministers would negotiate with black leaders on drafting of a new constitution that would bring blacks into the central government. `` We are not committed to the name, the form, the composition or the functions of such a body,'' he said. `` We are committed to the concept of a forum for deliberation.'' He said black leaders were unhappy with the term `` national council'' and suggested that their reluctance might be overcome by calling the forum `` the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indaba </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Indaba </LOCATION> is a Zulu word for a tribal assembly. Most prominent black leaders have rejected overtures to participate in the council, saying the government first must free imprisoned black nationalist leaders such as <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and lift restrictions on major anti-apartheid organizations. <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, chief minister of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> homeland and a leading black moderate, said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s electoral college proposal amounted to `` tokenism'' because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` does not admit to the existence of a black majority in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> for finding the courage to confront the far right. `` Now that he has taken a first tentative step to defy the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ... let him be bold and be explicit about how far he is prepared to go.'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, veteran <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member for the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> for not setting a timetable for his proposals. She said he was evading the question of black participation in Parliament. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became prime minister in 1978. That postition was abolished in 1984 with the adoption of a new consititution, and he was installed as president. In his speech, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> proposed that the office of prime minister be revived to handle day-to-day government affairs while the president concentrates on major policy matters and ceremonial duties. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said political progress in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be impeded by continued pressure from the `` international brotherhood of persecutors.'' He stressed that white South Africans' `` values and principles ... may under no circumstances be compromised.'' `` Should they collapse, then <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will collapse,'' he said. He chided anti-apartheid clergymen, such as Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, for their increasingly vocal opposition to the government and their calls for punitive sanctions. He said they play into the hands of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the major guerrilla movement fighting the government. The president said only a small fraction of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Christians supported the anti-apartheid stance of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and his colleagues

 A Japanese-American living in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said Thursday he expects to receive an apology for being interned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during World War II, but not to get reparations as approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON>, 68, a retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer working in public relations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said reparations were justified because Japanese-Americans lost possessions and five years of their lives. `` I think we'll get the apology,'' <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But he said he thought President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill that eventually emerges from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The chance that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would overturn a presidential veto was slim, he said, `` therefore the possiblity of getting the reparation is rather questionable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill Wednesday to give an apology and $ 20,000 in tax-free payments to Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and placed in camps after the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, 1941. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar bill in September. The Japanese government had no official reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action because it was a domestic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> issue, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yoshifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> told reporters. But <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said he personally praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action because he had been a consul general at the Japanese consulate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and had worked on the issue. `` After many years, the justness and fairness are recovered through democracy,'' <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said. `` This is the way of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy.'' <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> said he and his family were uprooted from their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> home in 1942 like thousands of other Japanese-Americans who fell under suspicion after the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. He had been about to graduate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, but instead ended up in a camp in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> with his mother and two younger brothers. His father was sent to a separate camp for community leaders, he said. <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> was inducted into the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1944 and was commissioned as an officer just as the war ended. His family was able to move to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> where they worked as farm laborers, living in the basement of an old house. After the war his family returned to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, again working as farm laborers. `` From the day they were evacuated in 1942, in 1947, five years later, they had n't gotten back to prewar status,'' <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> said. `` They had lost everything they had acquired up to 1942. ... I very definitely feel it -LRB- reparations -RRB- is very justified.'' He said his own military career in counterintelligence brought him to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on four tours after the war, and he spent 10 years on military duty in this country. Then, after he retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1966, he returned here to work and has remained ever since. <PERSON> Saiki </PERSON> is a member of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 150 members. `` Some of us are not in such pressing need for money,'' he said, `` but there are others who are. Half the people have died, and every year the number is getting smaller. The people who deserved the money and who need it are gradually dying.'' Asked if he felt <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had a role in the issue because its attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> led to the internment, he replied: `` It's an American problem. It's not because of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that it happened.''

 A recent surge in the number of immigration amnesty applicants shows that the program is working and the May 4 deadline need not be extended, the immigration service's No. 2 official said Thursday. `` We have had a rush of applications toward the end of the program, so we're sure people are aware of the deadline,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Everson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> deputy commissioner. `` They've had 1 -LCB- years to collect their documentation and come forward.'' <PERSON> Everson </PERSON>, speaking at an immigration law conference sponsored by three law schools, said a proposal to extend the amnesty application deadline six months will have a harder time passing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where it passed Wednesday by 12 votes. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will urge President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the measure if both houses approve it. `` It will send a bad signal to extend it,'' <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> told about 150 <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials, immigration lawyers, scholars and clergy involved in helping aliens file their applications. `` People waiting in other countries will interpret it as a lack of resolve, and they'll eventually come here with the thought that, well, they'll take care of me someday, too.'' Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, people who have been in the country illegally since before 1982 can apply for amnesty from deportation and obtain temporary residency. Eighteen months later, amnesty recipients may apply for permanent residency; eventually they can apply for citizenship. <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> said the imposition of employer sanctions has cut down on the number of undocumented immigrants. So far, 70 employers of undocumented aliens nationwide have been fined a total of $ 250,000, he said. The two-day conference is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> author of the 1986 law, opposes the extention `` Our numbers are right on target with the projections we used when we passed the bill. I do not honestly see a need or justification for extending the signup period,'' he said Wednesday. But during <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate, the chief sponsor of the extension, Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky. said 1.2 million aliens have applied for amnesty and 729,000 have received temporary residency cards <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had hoped 2 million of the estimated 3 million total illegal aliens in the country would apply for amnesty by the deadline.

 A fire believed to have been started by an arsonist swept through a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> department store Thursday, causing an estimated $ 2.5 million in damage, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported.

The state-run TV, which provided an unusual same-day report on the fire, showed footage of a man in jeans and a brown jacket being led away in handcuffs. The fire started at 4:17 a.m. and spread to the entire fourth floor before it was contained about two hours later, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. There was no mention of casualties, and the building presumably was empty in the early morning when the fire broke out.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> celebrated its 40th birthday Thursday but in the violence-ridden occupied territories it was called Firebomb Day, proclaimed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Military jets roared over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> honored veterans of the Independence war, who fought five <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> armies in 1948. Soldiers were on alert in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since the 1967 war, but Palestinians managed to throw a firebomb at a military patrol in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. Journalists were barred from much of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there are prohibited from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the rest of this week. Curfews in 23 towns and refugee camps affected about 400,000 Arabs. Palestinians were on general strike in much of the occupied lands, following the the instructions of a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leaflet. Violence has swept the territories since Dec. 8 and at least 169 Palestinians have been killed. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and civilian also have been slain. New details emerged Thursday about the assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander also known as Abu Jihad -LRB- Father of the Holy War -RRB-. Israeli sources said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commando team carried out the operation under the direct command of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, military chief of staff, and took documents from <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s home in a suburb of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. They also told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, speaking privately, that the government approved the mission on two other recent occasions but it was scrubbed both times for technical reasons. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was killed early Saturday. A Tunisian report said the job was done by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources confirm it, but government officials have declined comment. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, when asked about it Thursday: `` I suggest that we stop talking about this because I do n't want to continue discussing it. I do n't think anyone has anything to say about this.'' On its 40th Independence Day, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> faces international criticism both for the reported assassination of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> and the tough methods it uses in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> acknowledged the criticism on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, but added: `` This, too, will pass. ... I think we are coming close'' to ending the violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, however, released a 12-page booklet called `` Hamas'' -LRB- Zeal -RRB- that urges an even more intense struggle. `` Our style of resistance is according to what <PERSON> God </PERSON> told us: Kill them wherever you find them,'' said the Brotherhood, which has growing support in the occupied lands. `` This is the solution for those who follow the Koran,'' the Moslem holy book. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter who saw the firebomb thrown in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said soldiers responded with live ammunition, tear gas and rubber bullets, breaking windows in a home and a store nearby. Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION>, told the AP: `` The 40th anniversary of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reminds us of the uprising and our determination to achieve our legal rights and freedom.'' At a ceremony in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> signed the most comprehensive agreement to date between the two allies. It formalizes economic and military accords and binds future administrations. `` This is the most friendly administration we have ever worked with,'' the prime minister said. `` They are determined that the strong friendship and cooperation will continue and even be strengthened despite the differences that crop up from time to time.'' A military show highlighted the independence festivities, which extended from sundown Wednesday to sundown Thursday. One hundred Israeli air force planes, ranging from U.S.-made vintage Hercules aircraft to modern F-15 jets, flew over the center of the country, sometimes breaking the sound barrier. Over a stadium near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, the planes flew in star formations or formed the figure `` 40.'' Three Bell-206 and two Cobra helicopters performed aerobatic exercises. Four military jets flew in formation, releasing air streams dyed blue and white, the colors of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s flag, as <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> looked on. In the stadium, 1,500 Israeli soldiers staged mock battles and marching exercises and parachuted from planes in target jumps. `` I feel joy, excitement and pride,'' said <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, one of the 40,000 spectators at the stadium. `` I do n't believe in nostalgia,'' she said. `` People have to go forward.'' The military show, one of the most elaborate in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history, was broadcast live <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> held a reception for veterans of the Indpendence war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> became independent on May 14, 1948, which corresponds with April 21 on this year's Jewish calendar, and the armies of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> invaded on the same day.

<HEAD>CDC Study Says Many Cruise Illnesses Caused By Seafood Cocktail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Serious outbreaks of diarrhea aboard cruise ships have become rare, but the most frequent known culprit is a common delicacy: seafood cocktail, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> suvey. Of 45 outbreaks investigated from 1975 to 1985, the most frequently detected source was the seafood cocktails or salad, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> presented at a conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of all cruises during those years docked in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ports. `` It's a real popular food on cruises, and seafood is one food which can be contaminated if it's not handled properly,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Addiss </PERSON>, medical epidemiologist and author of the report. Water was the second most common source of the outbreaks during that 10-year-period, but <PERSON> Addiss </PERSON> noted that structural changes in the ships' water systems have all but eliminated that problem. In 25 of the 45 cases, the cause could not be identified. Ship captains must radio to shore a day before they arrive at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> port and report the number of passengers complaining of diarrhea. It is labeled an outbreak if more than 3 percent of the passengers are affected.

<HEAD>White House Opposes ABC Child Care Bill, But May Endorse
Alternative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes a proposed $ 2.5 billion child care bill, but may endorse other ways of helping families with preschool children, Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said that while the administration does n't like the Act for Better Child Care -LRB- ABC -RRB-, another bill giving a child care tax credit to any taxpayer with preschoolers _ whether they are cared for at home or elsewhere _ meets a series of principles he outlined in testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on human resources. It is not yet clear whether the administration will propose its own tax credit or support other federal initiatives to make day care more affordable or available, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Current tax law allows a credit for children cared for outside the home. `` It's a matter of debate and discussion within the administration right now,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill is backed by the Democratic leadership in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and scores of organizations representing children, women, labor, churches and medical personnel. It is sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION> Three-quarters of the $ 2.5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> money would help pay the child care bills in families making up to 115 percent of a state's median income. The rest would go for training and salaries for child care workers, renovation of facilities and referral programs for parents. A national advisory panel would develop minimum federal child care standards. Conservatives including <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> complained Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill is too expensive and cumbersome, promotes institutional care and discriminates against parents who stay at home with their children. And they said the income cutoff in the bill would let some families earning $ 40,000 get financial help. Another controversy centers on whether religious groups that provide child care would be eligible for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> grants. <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> said he is working for changes to make sure they qualify for money, but the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the bill as it stands violates the wall between church and state. `` This is one big new federal trough for churches,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, legislative counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. `` Too many of them want it and they're not willing to recognize the serious constitutional issues here.'' Another tax credit bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., appears to meet the objections of both conservatives and civil libertarians It simply would give all families a credit of $ 150 to $ 400 per preschool child. `` It offers more assistance and more choice to more families with less cost to the government,'' <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> told the subcommittee. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he personally favors the <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> approach even though some families might use the money for purposes other than child care. He said the tax credit meets the administration criteria of strengthening the family, treating stay-at-home mothers fairly, not promoting any particular type of care, targeting funds to those most in need and helping people without setting up a new bureauracracy. Reflecting statements submitted for the record by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> and assistant <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the federal government should not regulate day care centers, although `` I certainly see the need for some kind of standards so the public and individual families can have some security.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> have endorsed the gist of a middle-ground proposal sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. Their Child Care Services Improvement Act would give states $ 250 million in grant money for day care expansion and scholarships and $ 100 million to start risk pools to limit liability Another $ 25 million would be available to help home providers meet state licensing requirements.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told what he conceded was a `` very cynical'' joke Thursday as part of his response to a question about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at a world affairs forum here. After pledging efforts to secure talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I ca n't resist telling you a little joke. It's kind of cynical _ very cynical in a matter of fact _ about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' In the joke, a scorpion comes to a creek and asks a frog to carry him across it, because scorpions ca n't swim. The frog says, `` Why, you'd sting me if I did.'' The scorpion responds, `` That'd be silly because if I stung you and you died, I'd drown.'' `` Well, that made sense to the frog so he said, ` get on,' and started ferry him across and in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION> the scoprion stung him,'' the president said. As both were dying, the frog asked the scorpion, `` Why did you do that _ now we're both going to die.'' `` And the scorpion said, ` This is the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,''' the president concluded. The joke was greeted with laughter and applause by members of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In answering a question about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` we are going to keep on trying as hard as we can'' to bring about talks between the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' When asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was willing to talk with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Yes.'' He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` refused on principle'' to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> because he does not recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. `` What we are seeking is <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders who will agree to come together with the other Arab states,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Democratic Western Lawmakers Urge Western Strategy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty-eight Democratic lawmakers representing western states on Thursday released a letter urging their party's presidential candiates to make western issues a basic part of their campaign strategy `` We believe that our region could be the key to winning the White House this year,'' the congressmen said in letters intended for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and Assistant <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, are among those supporting the effort. `` In light of current polling data, as well as Democratic statewide victories throughout the region, 1988 could be a breakthrough presidential election year for the Democratic party in the West,'' the letter said. `` The Republicans know this too, and are already talking about a Western running mate,'' the congressmen said. Earlier this week, Republican chairmen from 18 western states urged Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to select a westerner as his running mate. Secretary of Interior <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> have been mentioned as possible <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominees. The Democrats' letter asked the party's candidates to meet with western lawmakers in the next few weeks to discuss a western agenda that includes such issues as Pacific Rim trade, energy policy, natural resources, environmental protection and regional economic development. The letter said there was `` no time to lose in formulating a western strategy'' and that upcoming primaries could `` lay the groundwork'' for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in the November general election. The next western primary is <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> on May 17, though several states will have conventions to pick delegates before that date. The nation's largest primary, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with 314 Democratic delegates, is June 7. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s primary also is June 7. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> signed the letter.

<HEAD>Federal Deficit Totaled $29.1 Billion in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government ran up a $ 29.1 billion budget deficit in March, but the amount of red ink in the first six months of the fiscal year was 3.5 percent less than the same period last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The deficit last month topped a $ 23.9 billion shortfall in February and a rare, $ 16.1 billion surplus in January, which occurred because Social Security checks that month were mailed early and were counted as part of December's spending. Analysts note that the budget imbalance is usually higher in March than in other months because because people who owe taxes for 1987 generally wait until April to pay, while those due a refund normally file early. For the first half of the 1988 fiscal year, the government has run a deficit of $ 118.9 billion, 3.5 percent lower than the red ink incurred for the same period a year ago. For the entire fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is projecting a deficit of $ 146.7 billion, down 2.4 percent from the $ 150.4 billion deficit in 1987. However, others use less optimistic projections. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the deficit will climb to $ 157 billion. Last year, the deficit fell sharply because of an unexpected $ 28 billion windfall in tax payments made by people who sold off long-term assets before the capital gains rates were increased under the new tax law. Some analysts say there could be a second, smaller windfall this year if people end up owing more in taxes for 1987 than they would have under the old tax law. That, however, will not be known until the government issues its budget report for April next month. In March, government revenue totaled $ 65.0 billion, while spending totaled $ 94.1 billion. For the first half of the year, revenues total $ 412.0 billion while spending amounted to $ 530.9 billion. As usual, the largest spending categories in March were the military followed by Social Security, other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and interest on the national debt. Military spending totaled $ 25.8 billion last month and $ 142.3 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 5.6 percent from the same period a year ago. Spending for Social Security totaled $ 18.4 billion last month and $ 105.0 billion for the past six months, up 5.6 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is exempted from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman law and is thus generally showing faster spending increases than the other categories. The other HHS programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 14.2 billion in March and $ 77.5 billion so far this budget year, a 5.9 percent increase over 1987. Interest on the $ 2.5 trillion national debt totaled $ 14.4 billion last month and $ 105.2 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.6 percent over the same period last year.

 Heart surgeon <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBakey </PERSON>, along with actors <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, spoke out on Thursday for continued use of animals in medical research, arguing that animals will play a major role in the search for a cure for AIDS and heart disease. <PERSON> DeBakey </PERSON>, who was first to perform a successful coronary bypass and the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart, recalled that when he was in medical school more than 30 years ago, `` not a single cardiovascular disease could be treated effectively.'' `` Now, we have patients who are living reasonably normal lives for 20 or 25 years after surgery,'' <PERSON> DeBakey </PERSON> said. `` The only means by which we can do these things is in working in labs with animals.'' <PERSON> DeBakey </PERSON> and the others said they chose this week to state their case to counter <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> protests by animal rights activists who oppose all use of animals in medical research. Barring that, some are pushing for stricter controls on the care and feeding of laboratory animals. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, a transplant surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, said he, like the animal rights activists, abhors cruelty to animals and said any incidents of poor treatment of research animals are the exceptions rather than the rule. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> began the news conference by saying he has worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Myasthenia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for about 20 years. Although great strides have been made in treating the disease, a cure still has not been found, he said. Both he and <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who began raising funds for <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>'s work on a polio vaccine after her daughter died of polio, argued that animals are necessary to medical research. `` If a cure is to be found for AIDS and heart disease, I see no alternative,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Janna </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, whose 7-year-old daughter was born with a congenital heart condition, said she `` was lucky. I did n't lose my daughter. Through animal research, doctors were able to develop a pacemaker for her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who is president of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> chapter of a group called Incurably Ill for <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said medical research has found cures for many diseases. `` We no longer have to live with diseases like polio,'' she said. `` That's when animal research is taken for granted.''

<TEXT>
 The full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will consider a bail request from two former state senators sentenced to prison for their role in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> on Wednesday declined to act by himself on a request by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> for bail pending their appeals. <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said she did not know if the justices would take up the motion at their regular session Friday. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> had denied the bail request Monday, so <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had to report Tuesday to the <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, federal prison to begin his 4 -LCB- - year sentence But lawyers for the brothers then submitted a new motion to <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Referring the question to the full court is a routine in such cases. Having the full court decide prevents petitioners from going from one justice to another seeking a favorable decision. The <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> brothers were convicted of fraud and obstruction of justice for accepting $ 50,000 to block a congressional investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the now defunct <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> defense contractor, which won multimillion-dollar contracts by claiming it was substantially owned by minorities.

<HEAD>U.S. Forces Preplanned Attack on Iranian Frigate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began its military operation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last Monday with the specific goal of sinking a particular Iranian frigate that was known for its vicious attacks on merchant ships, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Ironically, that goal was abandoned at one point during the fighting because another Iranian ship had been sunk. The frigate that had been targeted, however, ultimately came under attack after firing on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, only to be spared from sinking by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Those and other details of the most extensive military clash ever between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were released Thursday by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman. Beyond discussing the original attack plans, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> disclosed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been asked to make only one command decision during the course of the actual fighting, giving an OK for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets to bomb some small Iranian gunboats that had been spotted attacking ships and rigs in an oil field. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or seriously damaged two Iranian naval frigates and four smaller gunboats and fired on two Iranian jets Monday in fighting that erupted after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> destroyed two Iranian offshore oil platforms. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the destruction of the platforms in retaliation for the mining on April 14 of the frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Ten sailors were injured in that incident. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in previous briefings, had disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> originally planned to hit three platforms instead of two. One target was dropped, they said, when fighting erupted elsewhere in the gulf. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> acknowledged on Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also had included among its original targets an Iranian warship and that was why three <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships were steaming near the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> when the attacks began. The ship selected for sinking was the <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION>, a frigate that has earned the special enmity of all merchant seamen in the gulf because it makes a point of shooting at the crew quarters on tankers it attacks. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> agreed Thursday the decision to include an Iranian ship as a target was a first, but denied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was changing its policies or immersing itself directly in the Iran-Iraq war. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, had given assurances to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` that we considered their mining of international waterways to be a hostile act and if any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag vessels were damaged by those Iranian mines, that we would certainly respond.'' `` Now, we decided that as part of that response, we were going to sink an Iranian naval vessel,'' he continued. `` The Sabalan was a target of availability. We knew where it was. That was the first criteria. The fact that this ship had perpetrated any number of vicious attacks on merchant vessels in the gulf certainly did nothing to lessen our desire to use it as a target of availability.'' According to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the attacks on the platforms were scheduled to occur first, and when they did, the Iranians apparently warned the Sabalan by radio. It ran at high speed for the naval port at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, where the Iranian frigate anchored between two tankers, making it impossible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships to fire Harpoon missiles at it, he continued. Shortly after one of the platforms was attacked, an Iranian missile boat, the <PERSON> Joshan </PERSON>, attacked the cruiser USS Wainwright and was in turn sunk. `` At that point, we were prepared to terminate the operation,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The conclusion was that we had accomplished our goal.'' The Iranians, however, were not ready to stop. Another of their frigates, the Sahand, came charging out of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and fired on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships and jets overhead, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. It promptly was attacked and hit repeatedly and is believed to have sunk. It was at this point the <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION> steamed back out into the gulf and, like the <LOCATION> Sahand </LOCATION>, opened fire on American ships and aircraft. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> A-6 Intruder attack jet was ordered to use a laser-guided bomb against the <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION> and hit the ship perfectly, causing extensive damage. At this point, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said, the pilots asked permission to finish off the ship, and that request was relayed back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, discussed the matter briefly in the Pentagon war room, where they had been monitoring the action, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> concluded the ship should be spared further attack in hopes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would end the fighting. The order was passed and no further fighting ensued, the spokesman said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Thursday buried 44 sailors killed in battles with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> this week, and mourners declared that the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> would be `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s graveyard.'' An informal truce appeared to have suspended a missile duel that began Feb. 29 between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and has killed hundreds of civilians in the cities of both countries. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> got in the two last shots. Its official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said two surface-to-surface missiles were launched at <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, seat of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Moslem hierarchy, at 11.45 p.m. and they would be the last if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not retaliate. There were no reports of Iranian missiles being fired. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported several civilians killed and others wounded at <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, but gave no figures. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. Funeral processions were held at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushehr </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s two major ports on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Hundreds of mourners were shown on Iranian television shouting `` Revenege! Revenge!'' as they buried sailors killed Monday in the most serious engagement between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to the gulf to escort reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Young men waved banners reading: `` The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> will be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s graveyard.'' They shouted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>! Death to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>!'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s president is <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammed-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy commander, as saying the sailors fought a `` heroic battle'' with the Americans. He claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces fired on his men in the water after they abandoned their stricken vessels. It said <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> spoke to journalists while inspecting the frigate Sabalan, one of the ships damaged. No confirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties were reported in Monday's confrontation, but a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter with a two-man crew is missing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims to have shot it down. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said after a Cabinet meeting Wednesday night: `` We will not forget the blood of the Iranians shed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mercenaries in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should know we will not tolerate the presence of the filthy Americans.'' Monday's fighting began after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the platforms attacked as retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate last week and wounded 10 sailors. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said an Iranian patrol boat was sunk, three armed speedboats sunk or damaged and the frigates Sabalan and Sahand disabled.

 Tennis star <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> on Thursday won a major battle in his fight to play for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic team this summer when a skeptical <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted to give the Czech native immediate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. The measure, which even proponents had given little chance of passage earlier this year, was approved without opposition and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Subcommittee approval likely will lead to easy passage by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., a member of the panel and chief sponsor of the bill But the legslation still would face serious obstacles in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, is wary of Olympic exemptions The subcommittee voted to speed up the citizenship of <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> and two lesser-known Olympic hopefuls by removing the five-year waiting period permanent residents are required to go through. Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky., the panel's chairman who regularly opposes Olympic bills, said he was `` sympathetic'' to arguments that preventing <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> from participating in the Olympics would be a `` true hardship'' because an athlete's prime years are limited <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said, however, that he was concerned by the testimony of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> officials who said citizenship would not automatically make <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> eligible for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team. `` We're in kind of a Catch-22 in a way that we have to take action without actual assurance that these people would compete despite their world-class caliber,'' <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>'s consideration of the <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> measure reflects a change of attitude on Olympic citizenship bills. Last year, <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> outlined a new rule of his Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law that viewed private immigration bills as an `` extraordinary remedy available only to assist aliens with unusual problems and where extreme hardship ... can be demonstrated.'' It noted that the panel would be `` extremely reluctant'' to consider bills for Olympic athletes. But <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> supporters led by <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> redoubled their efforts this year when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, pushed through a special citizenship bill for a 21-year-old Canadian-born swimmer living in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said one of his concerns has been that the few athletes who won citizenship from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in past years have been unsuccessful in the international games. `` The one ski guy is still completing the course,'' <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said. But this year, for the first time, the subcommittee called in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Committee officials who vouched for the quality of <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Jens-Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burntd </PERSON>, an East German swimmer who defected in 1985 and is living in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gagik </PERSON> <PERSON> Barseghian </PERSON>, an Armenian wrestler who moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1986. The Olympics, which will be held Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, will include tennis as full sport for the first time since 1924 It was a trial sport in 1984. Modified Olympic rules will allow professional tennis players such as <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, the world's No. 1 ranked player, to compete. But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said under <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> rules, a player first must represent his country in the Davis Cup before the Olympics. Federation rules also say <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> needs a special waiver to play for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the Davis Cup since he previously has represented his native <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in those games. The next Davis Cup is in July. `` They need the citizenship to argue on behalf of the waivers and we create the citizenship without the knowledge that these people will ever compete,'' <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> rejected criticism that lawmakers are favoring athletes such as <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, pointing to dozens of other special immigration bills approved for non-athletes. `` We are put in the position of looking like we are taking care of a few famous people, when what we're trying to do is balance one arbitrary rule against another arbitrary rule,'' he said. <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, 28, moved to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in 1981 and received his permanent resident status last year. Immigration law requires a five-year waiting period before a permanent resident can become a citizen.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday was urged to ban most random drug testing of private employees and job applicants to protect them against `` cheap and wildly inaccurate'' urine tests used by a growing number of businesses. `` There are too many workers who are being subjected to bad tests, improper procedures and a profound lack of legal protection in the workplace,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing. Companies that conduct tests recklessly and without proper guidelines can `` ruin the lives of their employees'' and hinder legitimate efforts to prevent drug abuse, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` An incorrect drug test with no chance for appeal can swiftly destroy a career and a family.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on employment opportunities generally supported a bill sponsored chiefly by <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> that would ban private random drug testing except for `` probable cause'' and for workers in health or safety occupations. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s bill would require a follow-up test using a highly sophisticated method if an initial urine test shows positive for drug use. The measure also would give employees broad access to their drug test records. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said most urine tests are `` cheap and wildly inaccurate,'' and that more sophisticated tests are `` accurate but expensive.'' Under questioning by Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said he would welcome a provision calling for automatic rehabilitation instead of a firing for any employee who tests positive for drug use <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s estimate that 49 percent of the Fortune 500 list of largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses now administer drug tests to employees, and said the number is increasing. A recent <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> survey indicates that a minority of businesses do not provide follow-up tests to employees or job applicants who initially test positive, and do not tell applicants they were not hired because of a positive test, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official also reported that 13 of the 34 states surveyed do not regulate drug test laboratories and that some laboratories in about one-third of the 34 states are unregulated either by federal or state governments. `` It is my opinion that random drug testing is a waste of time and money, is counterproductive and can create a false sense of security,'' testified Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McBay </PERSON>, chief toxicologist for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state medical examiner's office. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Soley </PERSON> said there are virtually no legal safeguards against drug testing abuses for private employees except under terms of their labor contracts. Soley accompanied <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a school bus attendant in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> who was fired after her random drug test showed falsely that she had used marijuana.

 Developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who showed city officials how to get things done by fixing a Central Park skating rink faster than they could say `` fill this out in triplicate,'' now wants to try his hand at patching up the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> toured the crumbling bridge Thursday, calling repair work done so far `` scary'' and pronouncing himself the one to get it fixed. Savoring again his 1986 triumph of rebuilding the rink after the city and its bureaucrats tried and failed for years, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said the multimillion-dollar problem of the bridge stirs his imagination. He denied that he also may be stirred by another chance to show up Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, with whom he has been trading insults for two years. The 85-year-old bridge was closed last week when cracked and corroded beams were found. The bridge, one of three spanning the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, carried 240,000 daily commuters who drove or took the subway over the bridge. Officials expect that temporary repairs to the span will allow it to reopen in a matter of weeks, but the question of whether to then begin a total overhaul for $ 250 million or replace the bridge entirely for even more money is undecided. Officially, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was at the bridge for a look-see at the invitation of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON>, a former Republican state legislator from <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> who now runs the federal <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic mayor said <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON> was welcome to show the bridge to whomever he wished. But <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, commenting at a housing rally, said he has asked <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to put up moderately priced housing in the city, not just luxury buildings. `` After he's done that, then we can talk about other things, but not before,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON> told reporters that he had asked <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for help because he feared that city bureaucratic inaction would turn restoration of the bridge into a four - or five-year job But <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he'd had his eye on the bridge before <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON> wrote to him last week. `` I've already been here a number of times over the last number of days and weeks,'' said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. `` This is one of the things I'd be willing to do for the administrator -LRB- DelliBovi -RRB-, for the city, if they like. I would be willing to step up and get this bridge open quickly.'' Commenting on the estimate of $ 250 million to put the bridge right, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> told reporters `` I would hope to be able to do it for less.'' `` The figure is probably realistic, depending on what has to be done,'' he said. `` An easy solution is to spend a lot of money, but if you can spend a little money and get the same result, or a better result, that's what I'd be here for.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said the deal could work the same way as the skating rink construction in 1986 _ he would advance the money, get the job done and be reimbursed for costs. That repair project took five months and about $ 3 million, after the city had spent $ 12 million over seven years and still did n't have a working rink. `` I would n't want to make a profit,'' he said. `` This is something I want to do.'' During his tour of the bridge, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> pointed to holes and ragged edges on newly painted I-beams and said: `` Now that's the most scary thing, when they fix it, but it's not fixed. `` You're looking at beams where the rust is painted over, but there's nothing under there; it's all rotted out.'' City Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON>, reponded: `` In some cases, the repairs will come after the painting. No one's suggesting paint take the place of lost steel.''

 Officials frustrated with their inability to stop drug dealing say they will prosecute the owners of 200 `` crack'' houses and hope eventually to demolish the buildings. Seven drug dens have been destroyed in suspicious fires this year, the latest on Wednesday, fire department spokeswoman <PERSON> Cristy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said. `` People are taking the law into their own hands,'' said <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s assistant director of community development. `` Why are they doing it?

Vice Mayor <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Wednesday she also is trying to pressure the county <ORGANIZATION> Unsafe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Structures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to be more diligent. The county allows <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to put 15 buildings at a time on the demolition list _ while the city has hundreds it wants torn down. The city also said it will ask the county commission to allow it to set up its own Unsafe Structures Board with the power to raze buildings. The city says it eventually could recover the cost through liens on the property.

 American troops guarding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> detected two groups of intruders his week and in one case drew gunfire, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the latest incidents occurred on Tuesday and Wednesday nights near bases on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. They followed two other incidents last week, in which one Marine was killed accidentally and a group of Marines fired on what they described as a group of 40 to 50 armed intruders. The incident Tuesday, the more serious of the two this week, occurred around midnight near an ammunition storage depot next to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Station-Panama, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. An Army sentry stationed there spotted three men who had crossed `` inside the perimeter of the site,'' he said. `` The guard's report indicated that the intruders wore berets and carried small arms and bags. An intruder fired shots at the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- guard. The guard returned the fire, remained at the sentry post and requested assistance. `` The intruder then fired again. A Marine quick-reaction force -LRB- of 12 men -RRB- was sent to reinforce and assist in the search of the area. A security sweep of the area was completed during darkness with negative results, but the investigation continues. There were no casualties during the incident,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> added. The second incident occurred around 8 p.m. Wednesday when three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sentries manning an observation post to the west of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> detected roughly 30 intruders approaching the base, the spokesman said. `` The soldiers fired on the intruders, and they also fired two Claymore mines as a diversion,'' he continued. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said those intruders then retreated, apparently without firing any shots at the sentries. The spokesman disclosed the latest incidents in acknowledging the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had been unable to establish conclusively that armed intruders fired on Marines during one of last week's incidents. Military investigators spent several days combing the jungle area where about 100 Marines fired at what they believed to be 40 to 50 armed intruders near a fuel tank facility. `` It's true that there were no expended cartridge casings found,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Investigators did turn up, however, `` a couple of bottles of insect repellent not used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces; a used first-aid bandage; a black-colored kerchief, and also the sweep there revealed several well-established trails around the perimeter marked with slash marks,'' he said. `` There is other evidence as well. There were also some sensors set off in the area. But is it conclusive? I do n't believe it is. No final evaluation has been done on this at this point.'' The Marines have been ridiculed by Panamanian military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who accused them of firing at `` swaying palm trees.'' About 1,900 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have been ordered to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the last several weeks to provide increased protection for American bases and facilities near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> announced Thursday it will join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in building a space station, a decision that was hailed by the head of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space agency as the beginning of a new era in U.S.-Canadian cooperation. The $ 1.18 billion Canadian contribution _ about $ 1 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars _ will be a Mobile Servicing System, in effect a moving crane to unload visiting space shuttles or to move satellites around. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> thus joins the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which will spend $ 2 billion for a module to conduct micro-gravity experiments, as a participant in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station. The permanently manned facility is expected to be in operation in Earth orbit in the mid-1990s. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the last partner, is said to be nearing agreement. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotret </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s minister of science and technology, called the space station `` the most significant international space project of this century and the largest international technology development project ever undertaken.'' In response, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, called <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s decision `` the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our two countries.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the Mobile Servicing System was a vital and essential component for assembling and maintaining the station. `` Together we will build a permanently manned outpost in space and together we will explore the enormous potential of space _ sharing the benfits for decades to come,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> designed and built the robot arm that is used on space shuttles. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said it will spend $ 16 billion to put up the space station.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will not visit <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> soon despite speculation the burial of his murdered deputy in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> would signal a rapprochement with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> abandoned plans to attend <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s funeral on Wednesday because there were no guarantees of an official welcome or an audience with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, 52, better known by his nom de guerre of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, was gunned down by a commando unit that burst into his home in the Tunisian capital of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Tunisians blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the slaying of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s coordinator for unrest in Israeli-occupied territories. Miltary sources in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also confirmed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> involvement. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> boycotted a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting at which nations attacked it for <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination Tunisian Foriegn Minister <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Mestiri </PERSON> asked the council to condemn <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for `` terrorist aggression'' against his nation in <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s slaying. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was buried Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Yarmouk </LOCATION> refugee camp outside <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> as hundreds of thousands mourned. His slaying and the key role he played in the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> spawned new efforts to end the 5-year-old rift between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Long considered a pragmatic moderate within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was widely respected even by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s opponents in dissident Palestinian factions. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expelled from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in 1983 at the peak of a Syrian-sponsored mutiny in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ranks, but the Syrian government had said all <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, were welcome to take part in <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s funeral. Speaking in an interview at his headquarters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should have come for the funeral. `` If I were in his shoes, I would n't have missed this opportunity,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> dissidents have been based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, but the key groups such as <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s group and the Moscow-backed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> reconciled with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally, has been under pressure from the Soviets to reconcile with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to forge a united <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> front for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference it seeks to convene. Intensive contacts have been made in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders since they arrived Tuesday for <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s funeral `` The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership agrees that the body of our great struggler, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, should become a bridge for resuming relations between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> intends to reconcile with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> but that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appeared to be a stumbling block. The Syrians have been slowly mending fences with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent months. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been seeking <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s support for its latest <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative but refuses to deal directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until it recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Israeli sources said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commando team carried out the killing of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> under the direct command of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, military chief of staff, and took documents from <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s home in a suburb of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. They also told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, speaking privately, that the government approved the mission on two other recent occasions but it was scrubbed both times for technical reasons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Thursday said when asked about the assassination: `` I suggest that we stop talking about this because I do n't want to continue discussing it. I do n't think anyone has anything to say about this.''

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Plastic Gun Bill Aimed at Helping Airport Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House Judiciary subcommittee on Thursday unanimously approved legislation that would impose a five-year ban on the maufacture, sale or possession of plastic firearms which can evade detection machines. The plastic gun bill, aimed at stopping terrorists at airports, went to the full <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The panel could consider the legislation next week. The legislation defines a plastic gun as one containing less than 3.7 ounces of metal. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee on crime, said the metallic content was set at an amount that can trigger alarms on today's magnetometers. He said the standard was agreed upon by the departments of justice, treasury, transportation and the law enforcement community. The bill also would require firearm components to generate X-ray images which accurately depict the shape of the components. `` There is no question but that such firearms, once perfected, will become the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals, and pose an unnaceptable threat to the national security and public safety,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The bill would make it a federal offense to knowingly manufacture, import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm, with maximum punishment of five years imprisonment. There also could be fines of up to $ 250,000 for an individual and $ 1 million for an organization. Rival legislation would require that guns be detectable, but calls for no minimum metal content. That legislation is supported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

At that, the crowd of 200 let loose as many boos as cheers, and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> briskly moved back to the microphone. `` Hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

 Seven gunmen who held 42 people prisoner following a failed bank robbery in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ended their siege today and escaped with two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers as hostages 24 hours after the ordeal began. `` Thanks to you, the hostages are safe,'' a policeman shouted to the hundreds of people who had gathered outside the bank as the siege ended. The crowd had pressed officials to resolve the crisis peacefully. <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state Gov. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said the gunmen left in two armored cars, taking with them two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> rescue workers as hostages. Five people were killed and 15 wounded in the tense standoff in this Gulf of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> port. The 42 hostages still in the bank were taken to a local hospital by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> ambulances. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said in a television broadcast that the escape cars had enough gasoline for the gunmen to leave the city. He said in the interview on the Televisa network's afternoon news program that the agreement allows police to look for the gunmen later. `` We're not deceiving anyone,'' <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. `` We simply reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.'' The governor also said there were no injuries in a shooting incident during the morning, in which the gunmen grabbed weapons from a pickup truck outside the bank. Earlier news reports were that one gunman was wounded by police fire. One of the gunmen, speaking by telephone with a radio station in <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>, the state capital, said this morning they had reached an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers for the gunmen to leave the building safely. The gunman, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>, said two of them went out heading toward an ambulance but went instead toward a pickup truck, where they grabbed some guns. The police started firing and the gunmen rushed back inside, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> said. The private major television network <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> said one of them was wounded. `` We have more weapons now,'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> said. `` Here there are many innocent people. ... We are all going to die. ... They did not comply. They started to shoot. `` Let them give us the helicopter ... or we are going to blow up all of this. ... We do n't want innocent people to die, but if we are going to die, innocent people are going to as well.'' Earlier, in a telephone call to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s major morning TV news program on <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>, a gunman said officials broke their agreement by shooting. He also demanded a helicopter. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> got on the line and offered to let the gunmen meet with a committee of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials, journalists, a Roman Catholic priest and state police who would guarantee safety and due process of law. Hundreds of police surrounded the <ORGANIZATION> Banamex </ORGANIZATION> bank in this city of 120,000 on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, a spokesman for the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said one of its rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday between police and the gunmen He said the other four victims were a female bank teller and three customers. Other accounts said the dead included a bank official and a policeman. Earlier reports said there were six gunmen. The gunmen demanded to be allowed to travel to a nearby airport and leave on a plane, said <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state governor. The standoff began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday -LRB- 3:45 p.m. EDT -RRB-. Witnesses said the gunmen burst into the bank and took hostages after an alarm alerted police to the robbery. Another of the gunmen, in an interview broadcast live on <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> earlier this morning, said all the hostages were being treated well. Asked where they could go if given safe passage, he replied: `` I would n't be able to tell you where we could go. `` We ca n't turn ourselves in,'' he said. `` They want to kill us.'' The gunmen made telephone calls to <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> demanding to be allowed to leave the site. `` We do n't have anything to do with politics,'' one was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said one of two police officers inside conducting business, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, tried to prevent the robbery and was shot. He said the other officer apparently was disarmed by the robbers. The gunmen then attempted to leave the surrounded bank, using <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> and at least one customer as a shield, said <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, news editor at the <ORGANIZATION> Noroeste </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in the state capital of <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>, who was on the scene. The customer, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>, was killed and <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> received more wounds when the escape attempt led to a gunbattle between police and the robbers in which `` nine or 10'' hostages were wounded, <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> died at a hospital after the gunmen allowed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials to escort him from the building, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> identified the other two people killed as <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Andoval </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendon </PERSON>, a bank official who died of a gunshot wound to the chest, and cashier <PERSON> Rosi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, 22, who was reported shot in the face. <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> did not identify the dead Red Cross worker.

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Universal Health Care Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` today we make history'' Thursday as he signed into law <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' first-in-the-nation proposal to provide health insurance to all residents by 1992 `` What we do here today can and must be done all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the Democratic presidential front-runner told an estimated 2,000 supporters crowded onto the Statehouse steps for the signing ceremony. `` Today marks the day when working families, the unemployed, the disabled, students and children with special needs do n't go sick because they ca n't afford to stay well. Those days in the commonwealth are over,'' he said as the crowd applauded. `` From now on, when the sick land at the doorstep of our health care system, the first question of them will be: ` Where does it hurt?' Not, ` How will you pay?''' Only <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which has an exemption to federal law allowing it to require employer health coverage, has anything comparable to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law. However, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislation, which <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> aides say has generated inquiries from more than 20 states, goes beyond <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s approach by offering health security both to working and non-working residents. In his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't specifically mention whether he would seek similar federal legislation if he became president, but he did say: `` Today we make history. But there is more history to be made.'' `` As an American, I do n't want my country to stand alone with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as the only two industrialized nations that do not provide basic health security for their citizens.'' The bill was the outcome of a nine-month legislative struggle and comes two years after <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters endorsed a non-binding referendum by a 2-to-1 margin urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` enact a national health care program ... universal in coverage.'' The narrowly passed the legislature last week. `` The doubters said a lot of things,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And they were wrong.'' But doubters remain. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and spokesman for Physicians for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> called the health care bill a first step but said it was `` a Band-Aid approach when major surgery is needed.'' And House Minority Leader <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a Republican, described the bill as `` short-term gain and long-term pain. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has managed to pick up some short-term political gain at the expense of long-term fiscal pain for the commonwealth.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> estimated that the law's cost to taxpayers would be $ 645.2 million through fiscal 1992, minus about $ 22.5 million in projected cost-cutting in Medicaid. Other estimates put the cost to the state government in the next four years as high as $ 1.2 billion. The thrust of the law is to provide coverage to about 600,000 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents under age 65 currently without health insurance, roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth. This would be done in stages and through a variety of approaches, from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults and children to state-brokered, pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals. By 1992, all employers with more than five full-time employees must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured.

 Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., seeking to force a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on the issue of `` war and peace'' in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, said Thursday he will introduce legislation to authorize the continued presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in the gulf and set rules for their use <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he will also seek congressional action to trigger the War Powers Act, which requires the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from hostile areas within 60 days unless their continued presence is specifically approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the last year we have deployed dozens of American ships in the gulf,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` We have spent tens of millions of dollars. We have asked Americans to sacrifice their lives. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has never authorized the deployment, never appropriated any money, never clearly stated its support for the policy that is being followed.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said a number of individual senators have offered the administration specific suggestions on changes or modifications in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy and some are being considered seriously. But he said that is not enough. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as an institution has to give some guidance to the administration,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` ... <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a right and a responsibility to debate the policy being followed by the administration as well as the right to consider alternatives. `` Only by engaging in a full and frank debate, only by working with our colleagues and having the administration work with us, can we refine our approach to the problem and strengthen our national commitment to solve it,'' he said. The War Powers Act is a post-Vietnam attempt to apply a congressional brake to unilateral presidential decisions to expose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to possible hostilities. It has been resisted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as an encroachment on the president's authority as the nation's military commander in chief <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he realizes an attempt to invoke it will be challenged but said the act should be implemented because it remains `` the law of the land.'' `` I am not trying to force the withdrawal of American forces from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` We have a right to be there and a mission to perform there.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he is only seeking to protect the constitutional right of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to be involved in decisions to deploy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces into areas of hostility.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> gave up his 1988 White House bid Thursday, offering the strong suggestion that he harbors hopes of a future campaign and moving to protect the delegates he has won so far. `` It hurts to have come so far and have fallen short,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office room crowded with supporters. `` But there will be other days for me and for the causes that matter to us.'' The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator ended the race deeply in debt after waging a long-shot campaign that challenged the traditional dominance of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. It succeeded in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where he won favor as a moderate, but fell flat elsewhere. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he would technically remain a candidate to permit his delegates to attend the Democratic National Convention. In suspending his campaign, he delivered some of the most eloquent lines of his campaign, praising each of his opponents, excoriating Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and pledging support for the eventual nominee. `` I want no part of a stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or a stop <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> movement,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` The only man I want to stop is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I will not be the Democratic nominee for president in 1988,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` The nominee is going to be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. I'm going to do everything I can to help them do what I set out to do, and that is to put a Democrat in the White House.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> exited with a joke after a failed campaign that he said lasted 10 months and a million miles. `` I was doing great until I turned 40,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during his campaign, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. His decision to suspend his campaign rather than quit the race means the two remaining active candidates can not pick up delegates he has already won, but who have not yet been chosen. Under party rules, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have gained 34 of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegates immediately, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have gotten 29 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to suspend his campaign denied <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> another 47 delegates he would have inherited in this manner. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he spoke with both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and that both were `` comfortable'' with his decision to hold onto the delegates. He said the move would protect <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders who backed him in states where delegates had not yet been chosen, naming <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> as an example. He said he planned no endorsement and repeated his oft-stated contention that he has `` no interest'' in the vice presidential nomination, though he left that door open. `` I'm not trying in any way to broker a convention that is not going to be brokered anyway,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s withdrawal was assured by his dismal third place showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a 10 percent finish that capped six weeks of frustration for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> since his six-state victories on Super Tuesday in the South. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had become his last chance to get back into contention. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is saddled with a debt of more than $ 1.5 million, run up in borrowing for his campaign in Super Tuesday states and after that in an effort to break through outside the South. His debt is the largest of the 1988 presidential candidates who have departed the race, although as a senator he is in a position to raise money to retire the debt. He spent the night before his announcement in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, raising money to repay the debt. Facing little support in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and an appeal not in sync with that state's left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activists, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> challenged the assumption that candidates must do well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses. He bypassed the state and blasted its process as a distortion, and concentrated on the South. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign was marked by internal disorganization and division, and a tendency to postpone decisions. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> often made the decisions himself from the road. One result was that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent nearly the maximum amount allowable in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ over $ 400,000 _ but did it late and without an accompanying commitment of time and campaign staff to campaign full force. The result was he was neither fully in nor fully out there, and finished fifth in a seven-way race. He broke through with wins in six states in the South. But then he went through the succession of Northern states, beginning with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, largely an unknown figure and unable to make any progress.

 Actor <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Danson </PERSON>, the bartender in the television series `` Cheers,'' came to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Thursday to announce formation of a new environmental coalition he said is aimed at stopping ocean pollution. <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> told a news conference that as president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, `` I am going to dedicate my resources and my ability as an actor to focus attention on the plight of our oceans.'' He said the organization, based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, would be pushing for enactment of legislation to set a national policy for protection of the oceans, with emphasis on: _ Reducing and then ending the dumping of toxics and sewage into coastal waters _ Establishing national ocean parks to protect environmentally sensitive and economically important shorelines _ Deferring offshore oil and gas development until there is a national energy policy that emphasizes conservation and alternative energy sources The group's multipurpose goals were questioned by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group representing companies involved in offshore oil and gas activities. `` I think it's important the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people realize this is a facade to stop offshore oil development,'' said <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>. He said that some of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>'s directors, including <PERSON> Danson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, are active in groups fighting drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. `` They are using the other people, other groups and congressmen to stop offshore oil,'' <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON> said. `` I would question how much effort they're going to devote to sewage sludge, toxics and plastics pollution.'' <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> was not available to respond to <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>'s statement, issued several hours after the news conference. Calls to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Takoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were answered by recording devices. <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> said that his interest in ocean ecology was stirred 18 months ago when he took his two daughters to a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> beach and a saw a sign saying `` no swimming, water polluted.'' `` We have always taken for granted that we can dump anything we want into the oceans _ all of our wastes, all of our toxics _ and assumed that it would always be absorbed,'' he said. `` That is no longer true,'' <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> said. `` Dead fish are washing up on the beaches of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and beaches are being closed on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will be a full partner in the $ 14 billion space station project intended to put a manned platform in space by the late 1990s, Industry Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotret </PERSON> announced Thursday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Conservative government had delayed a decision on the project for three months after the estimated cost to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> over the next 17 years escalated from $ 648 million -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- to $ 972 million. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotret </PERSON> said 90 percent of the money will be spent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, producing $ 4 billion in spinoffs beneficial to science and industry. `` We've got a place in space,'' he told a news conference. He termed the project `` an investment in ourselves, our ingenuity and our brain power.'' About half the extra funds required will come from a $ 1 billion science and technology fund announced by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in January. It was originally intended solely for university programs. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s contribution will be a roving space robot to act as the hands and arms of the station. The computerized robot would have sight, touch and reasoning powers and would unload cargo, repair satellites and do other tasks. In return, Canadian astronauts would have access to the station for about three months a year for experiments. The largest international civilian space venture in history will consist of three laboratories built separately in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and a giant, metallic living module made by the Americans. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is the final partner to join the consortium. The government has yet to decide between <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> as the headquarters for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> space agency that will oversee the project. Most of the country's aerospace industry is located near <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>.

 The normal pleasantries of a congressional hearing were disrupted Thursday by a charged exchange between a congressman and a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary over their family backgrounds. Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, D-Mich., opened a hearing on his major child care bill by describing his own traditional upbringing He said his father worked at a <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> plant and his mother stayed home to take care of her several children. Suggesting to Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> that their backgrounds were similar, he commented, `` We must recognize that very often there is no father in the family. ... We have to recognize that changing family structure whether we like it or not.'' Several minutes later, when he got his turn to talk, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> bluntly and unexpectedly took issue with <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>'s assumption that they came from similar families. `` I did not grow up in <LOCATION> Ozzie </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>'s home or in a Father Knows Best home. It might have been nice to,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, creating a sudden hush in the packed hearing room. The education secretary said he came from a typical inner-city broken family. `` My father left home when I was quite young,'' he said. He and his brother were raised by his mother, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, with the aid of informal child care arrangements. `` She held two jobs, my mother, and put in whatever time she could'' with her children, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` She did this without much benefit from the state or federal goverment, although she could have used some help.'' Moments later, <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> started to describe the need for child care in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which he said has a 20 percent unemployment rate. `` I have to walk through the real world,'' he said. `` I'm invited to country clubs, but I do n't go there often ...'' `` I do not belong to a country club, any country club,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> broke in defensively `` And <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> -LRB- where he grew up -RRB- is every bit as much the real world as <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>.'' `` Let's not be confrontational. We're talking about children,'' <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> replied, his voice rising in surprise. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> persisted. `` Some people believe all Republicans were born rich ...'' `` I know <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> so I know that's not true,'' <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> interjected quickly, referring to the young <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> congressman sitting next to him. The room filled with laughter and the tension broke. But Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, had the last word. He said he was one of eight children of parents who both worked inside and outside the home. In view of where he, <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> have ended up, <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said, the evidence is clear: `` No matter how you raise a child, he can still go wrong.''

<HEAD>Judge: Jury To Decide Conspiracy Claim In Cancer-Liability Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Evidence in a closely watched cigarette liability case is sufficient for a jury to consider whether three cigarette manufacturers conspired to cover up the dangers of smoking, and the trial should continue, a judge said Thursday. `` The evidence presented ... permits the jury to find a tobacco industry conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and devastating in its results,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>. At the same time, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> dismissed a claim that the three companies sued in the liability case _ <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ caused <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lung cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette. The judge's comments came in a 33-page opinion requested by the cigarette makers, who asked for dismissal of the case and an end to the trial that began Feb. 1. The companies are being sued by Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, whose wife died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years. Attorneys for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> completed their case two weeks ago, alleging that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was a victim of a campaign by the cigarette makers to undermine warnings about the dangers of smoking. In the opinion that was quite pointed at times, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said the jury should be allowed to consider the conspiracy and punitive claims in the case. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said evidence indicated the companies conspired to conceal and misrepresent information on the dangers of smoking and to `` refute, undermine and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical community.'' He said the evidence also indicated the companies tried to `` confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence smoking.'' `` The jury may reasonably conclude that defendants were members of and engaged in that conspiracy with full knowledge and disregard for the illness and death it would cause, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was merely one of its victims,'' the judge said. As for punitive damages, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said: `` If the jury accepts the plaintiff's version of the facts as to the conduct of the defendants, it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for an award of punitive damages.'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys said they were pleased with the opinion. `` The judge says we have a case for the jury,'' attorney <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. `` If a case should be won, this is it,'' she said, adding that her side introduced as evidence secret internal cigarette company documents never before made public. They included memorandums that spoke of a public relations `` war'' against health-related charges involving cigarettes. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, took exception to the tone of <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s opinion. `` I do think there were flourishes there from the judge's pen that went beyond the plaintiff's evidence,'' he said. Wall also said he believed the heart of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s case was gutted by <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s opinion. `` The conspiracy claim is very tenous at best,'' he said. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> dismissed a claim that the companies were liable for Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s death on the basis they knew how to design a safer cigarette but failed to. The judge said <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys could not prove Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> would have smoked the safer cigaratte had it been marketed. Ms. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the dismissal of that claim, which the defense contended was the heart of the case, was not a critical blow. `` We thought it was an important theme, not so much for this case but for the broader implications in future cases,'' she said. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> also dismissed a claim that the companies failed to do enough research on the dangers of smoking. While there was ample evidence that the research was inadequate, the judge said, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys did not prove that this directly harmed Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. Another claim, that the companies failed to warn smokers of the dangers of cigarettes, was also dismissed against <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, but the judge said the jury will be able to consider that allegation in the case of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> began smoking cigarettes made by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> after 1966, when the federal government began requiring warnings on cigarette packs. However, she smoked cigarettes made by <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> prior to 1966 and there is evidence `` from which the jury could infer that, prior to 1966, ordinary consumers were not adequately informed of the health risks of smoking,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was `` confident we will prevail on the basis of evidence that comes out during our presentation.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Friday for a `` routine dental checkup,'' while his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has her first X-ray examination following breast cancer surgery, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> disclosed Thursday. `` The president and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, en route to Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, will stop briefly at the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> for routine radiological procedures,'' the spokesman said in a statement. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will undergo a routine series of dental X-rays in the dental clinic, while Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have her first post-operative mammogram,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the tests `` represent routine checkups, and are not associated with any current physical findings or problems.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had her left breast removed on Oct. 17, 1987, after doctors discovered a quarter-inch cancerous lesion. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said the first couple expected to be at the medical center in suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for about an hour. `` It's Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s six-month checkup, and the president planned to use the time to get his dental X-rays taken, rather than usually doing it at the White House,'' the spokeswoman said. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said the couple wanted to have the results of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s exam before they left `` so they could send her off for a comfortable, worry-free weekend.'' The spokeswoman said White House physician Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> planned to be present for Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s exam. The mammogram is to be conducted by a radiologist, Dr. <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbo </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he expected to have some type of report on the exams by late Friday afternoon. He added that the president will undergo `` no other examination.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> usually has a cleaning and checkup every three months at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but that the president planned to have a `` panoramic'' X-ray done this time in order to get a full-view picture of his mouth. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> explained that the White House has X-ray machines that take pictures of part of the mouth, but does not have the larger machine that pans the entire mouth area. The spokesman identified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dentist as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Judkins </PERSON>. He said the president has not had any complaint about his teeth. The last time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited the hospital was in January, when he underwent his annual checkup for colon cancer. It is the first time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has gone to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> for dental work. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who traveled to <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, on Thursday to deliver a speech on U.S.-Soviet relations, appeared in good spirits upon his return to the White House in the late afternoon. He smiled, waved, and gave journalists a `` thumbs-up'' signal, but refused to answer questions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> Jan. 15 for a four-hour examination to check against the recurrence of colon cancer. He has had regular checkups every January and June since he underwent successful colon cancer surgery in July 1985. The January test showed no renewal of cancer and no growths. He was proclaimed by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> at the time to be `` in excellent health.'' Except for the last checkup in January, doctors have discovered and removed small, fleshy growths known as polyps from Reaan's colon In each instance, the growths turned out to be benign. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned 77 in February and is the oldest man to be president.

<HEAD>Missing Baby Found Two Counties Away By Godfather</HEAD>

 Before <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwitz </PERSON> was 24 hours old, he had been taken from his mother, found 170 miles away by a police officer who happened to be his godfather, and sent back to his parents. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 32, were being held by authorities in <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION>, where the infant was found in the back seat of a car, said <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> Police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. ` It's a heck of a coincidence,'' said officer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> after he found his godson and namesake. The 4-hour-old son of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwitz </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Payson </LOCATION> area, had been taken from <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yavapai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 7 p.m. Wednesday. Police said a a woman masquerading as a hospital laboratory worker told the mother she was taking the baby for some tests. Hospital officials realized the child had disappeared about 45 minutes later when Mrs. <PERSON> Gerwitz </PERSON> asked a nurse when her son was going to be returned to her, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said. Just after midnight, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> Holbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and asked for traveler's aid, such as gas money and a place to stay, Sgt. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was helping Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who said she was alone, when he discovered she actually was traveling with a man and a baby, <PERSON> Bracke </PERSON> said. Police found the three matched the description of a man and woman seen in the hospital, and the missing baby. They were able to confirm the baby's identity three hours later. After little <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was examined at <ORGANIZATION> Holbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and pronounced in good health, authorities drove him back to <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>. He was reunited Thursday afternoon with his parents at the hospital. Mrs. <PERSON> Gerwitz </PERSON> appeared briefly with the baby in her arms to thank law enforcement officers, hospital personnel and others who assisted in getting her son back. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> knew the kidnapped baby's parents from high school, <PERSON> Bracke </PERSON> said. Hospital administrator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> apparently pulled off her masquerade as a laboratory technician by dressing in a lab coat she probably picked up in the hospital's obstetrics area. `` Lab coats are in the nurses' lounge, and on hall trees in the <ORGANIZATION> OB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. Hospital policy is that when our OB nurses go to a different part of the hospital, they put on the lab coats to minimize infections,'' <PERSON> Vitek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vitek </PERSON> also said hospital officials will review the `` entire package of hospital policies relating to security of infants.'' `` We expect to have some feedback from the investigators from the <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> police,'' he added.

<HEAD>Rebels Threaten Development Projects; Farmers Demand Land Reform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist rebels threatened Thursday to attack any development projects funded by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian governments on the impoverished island of <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION>. In another development Thursday, about 10,000 militant farmers marched through <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to demand land reform. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> branch on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Canadian-financed projects there were being used as `` tools to oppose the revolutionary movement. The Front is the communist rebel umbrella organization. It said the projects were among targets singled out by the rebels as they prepare to step up attacks on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION>, 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Other targets include military units, multinational corporations and individuals considered `` enemies of the people.'' The threat came in a statement signed by rebel <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and sent to news media in <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> heads the <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> chapter of the Front. Hours later, suspected communist rebels shot and killed a policeman and a militiaman in an ambush near a cemetery in <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION>, police said. The statement did not specify any single project and did not say if the attacks will include assassinations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian aid personnel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian aid officials were not in their <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> offices Thursday and could not be reached for comment. It could not be ascertained if any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or Canadian personnel were stationed on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> island. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said earlier it had stepped up security and told its staff to take extra precautions after communist rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino in attacks last October outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Clark Air Base north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Another Front statement circulated during daylong marches and a rally in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> urged farmers to join the 19-year-old insurgency. It said the rebels had redistributed land to farmers in areas they control and that `` revolutionary land reform and armed struggle are the only ways to free the farmers.'' Several legislators, including President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, Sen. <PERSON> Agapito </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and priests and nuns joined the protesters They urged the farmers at a rally to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a meaningful land reform law. Thursday's marches and rally were peaceful, and the protesters dispersed at sundown without incident. But <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadeo </PERSON>, leader of the protest, denounced the military for blocking thousands of farmers as they approached <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in motorcades early Thursday from seven outlying provinces. The Most Rev. <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacani </PERSON>, Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said the church backed the farmers' demand for immediate land reform and said there was a need to `` wake up ... -LRB- legislators' -RRB- consciences if they are asleep.'' Last July, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> decreed a nationwide land redistribution program but left most details up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved separate land reform bills last month but still have to reconcile differences in the two drafts, which peasant groups say favor landlords.

<HEAD>Reagan Concerned That Senate May Not Rafify Treaty Before Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>DESK: SUBS grafs 5-7 bgng ``Senate Majority Leader ... '' to
update with fresh Byrd material.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday he is `` very concerned'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may not ratify the pending U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty before he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for summit talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In a question-and-answer session after a speech to the World Affairs Council of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked by a law student what the effect on the talks would be if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had not yet ratified the treaty. `` I think it would be very upsetting and would put a strain on the summit if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not ratified the treaty by the time we go there,'' the president said. `` We hope and pray that they will, but their scheduling of it has been such that I am very concerned we may have to go without having had it ratified,'' he said. Replying to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told a news conference he will not schedule the treaty for debate until a dispute is resolved on whether or not the pact bans futuristic weapons such as those using laser beams or particle He said this can be done only by attaching a reservation to the treaty's resolution of ratification or by obtaining an authoritative and binding commitment from the Soviets. `` The date of the summit does not drive me at all and it should not drive the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` This treaty is in a vacuum by itself and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has to make a judgment ... Remember, we're dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> I want to be sure all the I's are dotted and all the T's are crossed before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts on ratification of this treaty.'' `` I want this treaty,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` I have no doubt it will be approved at some point. But I want to be absolutely certain our interpretation -LRB- that the treaty bans medium-range futuristic weapons -RRB- is authoritative and documented by the Soviets as being their interpretation and their commitment likewise.'' `` It is n't my fault that those who negotiated this treaty did n't bring this issue into the procedings,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said He said he has no objection of opening debate on the pact on May 9, if the issue of futuristic weapons is resolved by then. But he said that once debate begins many amendments will be offered to the treaty by opponents. `` I do n't know how much time it will take,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. The pending treaty, covering intermediate and shorter-range missiles, was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their summit meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December. When the two leaders meet again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29 to June 2, one of the issues confronting them will be a treaty still being negotiated that would cover longer-range intercontinental nuclear missiles. Of this treaty, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` There is a great question as to whether it could be ready for signature at the summit.'' `` We do n't want a fast treaty,'' he said. `` We want a good one.'' On another issue, the president was asked about a trade bill being considered on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that if it reaches his desk in its present form, he will veto it. He also said he would immediately ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact a new bill that did not contain provisions to which the administration objects, including a requirement for companies to give workers notice of plant closings. In response to a question about the trade deficit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that in the latest government report the deficit `` went up a little bit. They did n't say a little bit _ they made it sound horrendous, something about around $ 13 billion plus in trade deficit. What they did n't add was that exports had been at the highest level seen so far.'' In his speech to the group, which was billed as a scene-setter for the upcoming summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proclaimed a `` period of realistic engagement'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Even while freedom is on the march, Soviet-American relations have taken a dramatic turn, into a period of realistic engagement,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Two of the most basic rights that we have called on the Soviets to comply with,'' the president said, `` are the right to emigrate and the right to travel. How can we help but doubt a government that mistrusts its own people and holds them against their will? `` And what better way would there be to improve understanding between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than to permit free and direct contact between our two peoples? In the new spirit of openness, why does n't the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government issue passports to its citizens? I think this would dramatically improve U.S.-Soviet relations.'' On <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his audience, `` Now the Soviets say they have had enough.'' `` But let me say here that the next few momths will be no time for complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves. The Soviets have rarely before _ and not at all in more than three decades _ left a country, once occupied. They have often promised to leave, but rarely in their history, and then only under pressure from the West, have they actually done it.'' Turning to the treaty on intercontinental missiles now being negotiated, which both sides have said they have some hopes of signing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that the treaty on medium and shorter-range missiles signed in December `` is reality and now the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should give it ratification.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters on the flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One that `` we think everyone wants to ratify the treaty before the summit. The impetus is for that to happen. It would be a shame if it did not happen. We think we can overcome any obstacles. But there are still hurdles to be crossed.''

 <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> took the witness stand Thursday to defend his hit song `` Just Another Night'' against a reggae musician's charge of plagiarism, saying the first time he heard the other man's song was after the lawsuit was filed. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> that he he started in music 25 years ago in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he had composed 200 to 300 songs, both alone and with <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, guitarist in the Rolling Stones. Reggae musician <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is suing <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, claiming the famed <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> took the chorus from <ORGANIZATION> Alley </ORGANIZATION>'s 1979 song, also called `` Just Another Night,'' and used it in <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s 1985 solo hit. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s testimony came on the fourth day of the trial. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> told the jury that the first time he heard <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song was in his attorney's office in 1986 after the lawsuit was filed. His attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Parcher </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> what he thought of the song and he said, `` I do n't want to cast aspersion on Mr. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>. A lot of people in this courtroom do n't like my music. Personally, I do n't really like that song.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> testified that he often recorded songs by other artists and had no hesitation in giving them credit. For more than an hour, the jury and a courtroom filled with fans and reporters heard how <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> developed his song, beginning with a November 1983 tape, which <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> described as `` just me, with acoustic guitar, starting off with this tune.'' Several tapes were played, detailing how <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, other musicians and arranger <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alomar </PERSON> developed the song into the form that would ultimately appear on his 1985 solo album, `` She's the Boss.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> rocked back and forth to the beat as the tapes played, sometimes seeming embarrassed as, on the tape, he grunted or made other sounds as substitutes for lyrics. He said that on none of the tapes did drummer <PERSON> Sly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> appear. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, who appeared on the final cut of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s song, allegedly was the drummer on <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>'s song in 1979. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> has testified that he could n't remember. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s lawyers say <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s song netted as much as $ 6 million. The courtroom had been set up with amplifying equipment in anticipation that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> would perform, but that did not occur Thursday. Another of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, said, `` He'll play if he has to, if the only way to prove it and show it, he will. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was scheduled to resume testifying Friday afternoon. Earlier Thursday, a music expert testified on his behalf that the two songs were very different and that the title, `` Just Another Night,'' was fairly common. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricigliano </PERSON>, chairman of the theory department at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the rhythmical settings of the two choruses were similar because of the similarity of lyrics and ideas, the choruses were `` totally different'' in every musical way. He testified that a review of song titles at the Performing Arts Library in <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> revealed more than a dozen songs since 1928 with the title `` Just Another Night.'' Earlier in the week, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s expert witness, <PERSON> Juilliard </PERSON> teacher <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, said his analysis of the songs found the choruses to be `` virtually identical.'' Outside court Wednesday, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> had said: `` My credibility is on the line because of this. ... I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that the songs are entirely different aside from a few words and the title.'' He called the trial a `` ridiculous waste of time.'' Alley's chorus lyrics are, `` Can I spend another, just another night, just another night, just another night with you.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s lines are, `` Give me just another night, just another night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through.'' The jury is to determine only whether there was an infringement of <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s copyright. If the jury finds in <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>'s favor, the parties can arrange a settlement on damages or can have damages determined at a second trial.

 A new federal government with fewer departments and a drastically reduced staff was appointed Thursday in a move to tighten the belt on <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s bureaucracy The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the new 20-member government was appointed by President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. The changes, however, were proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership at a recent meeting. The previous 26-member government resigned Wednesday, one day after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> rubber-stamped a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decision to merge five ministries into two. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, changes in government are decided by the party leadership. <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> remains premier in the new government, which has six deputy premiers instead of ten. There had been some speculation that Strougal might be replaced. The new government now has ten ministries, three less than previously. `` Times were never easy for governments,'' <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> said. `` But these are the most difficult times. `` We know what we want ... but at the same time we must count on many unexpected phenomena which we shall have to solve both in economic and social development as well as in internal and foreign policy, where more activity and initiative is needed on our part,'' <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has adopted the rhetoric of reform over the past year, but has proceeded cautiously in making changes like those carried out in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who was replaced as party leader in December by <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, said each minister is to `` look critically at the area he is responsible for.'' The governments of the Czech and Slovak republics also were reorganized, reducing their ministries by four and three, respectively. The shuffle apparently is designed to streamline government bureaucracy and spur the country's economy. The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said the staffs of the federal and <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> governments are to be cut by about 30 percent. Rude Pravo said `` thousands of people'' would be fired through the reorganization of state administration. However, it said no one would be left without a job. `` The process must be aimed primarily at ensuring the growth of quality and performance of the managing aparatus and at a good and effective use of the released workers primarily in places and professions where manpower has been lacking so far,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON> as saying. Former deputy Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerle </PERSON> now heads a newly created ministry of metallurgy, engineering and technology, which merges three separate ministries. The ministries of communication and transport were combined under <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazek </PERSON>, the former minister of transport. The only new member of the government, according to sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, is <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, minister without portfolio, who is in charge of government coordination.

 About 5,000 factory workers in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> rallied Thursday, chanting `` Solidarity, Solidarity!'' and demanding pay raises to offset recent price increases, an opposition spokeswoman said. Activist <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubema </PERSON> said the rally took place in front of management headquarters of the sprawling <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> heavy machinery plant, 95 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. It employs 18,000 people. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtas </PERSON>, chairman of the factory chapter of the outlawed Solidarity trade union movement, read a speech listing workers' demands, including across-the-board pay raises of $ 50 a month, she said The average wage in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is about $ 90 a month. She said another demand was an end to harassment of union activists. The union threatened a strike at an undefined date if its demands are not met, she said. The union had called for the demonstration in leaflets distributed over the past two weeks, said Ms. <PERSON> Kubema </PERSON>. It began at 2 p.m., the end of the first shift, with a whistle from the factory's locomotive repair shop, she said. At that time, there were about 10,000 workers at the plant. After <PERSON> Wojtas </PERSON>' speech, she said, workers chanted `` Solidarity, Solidarity!'' and sang the national anthem, holding up their hands in V-for-victory signs. She said there were no arrests at the rally, but lawyer <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Liwak </PERSON>, secretary of the Solidarity committee at the factory, was detained at his home. Solidarity was banned after the 1981 martial law crackdown in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but local units continued to function clandestinely at many factories. In a shift of union strategy last year, new units were organized publicly, and dozens of them have unsuccessfully gone to court seeking legal registration under a 1982 labor law. Government price increases of 40 percent took effect this year, part of the government's program of economic reform. At the same time, workers in socialized enterprises received an automatic $ 15 monthly pay raise. Authorities expressed concern that factory managers, under worker pressure, will be too generous about awarding additional wage increases. They warned managers they could lose their jobs unless wage increases are merited by higher productivity.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Cuts Star Wars Spending, Approves MX, Midgetman
Spending</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted Thursday to cut spending for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' program, but also generally granted administration requests for the Midgetman and MX missiles, congressional sources said. The votes by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on strategic weapons and nuclear deterrence came behind closed doors as the panel began working on a bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. The panel voted to approve $ 4.6 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan is formally known, according to the sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, which is authorized for $ 3.9 billion in the current fiscal year. The panel also voted to generally approve <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request of about $ 200 million for research into the single-warhead Midgetman and $ 800 million for research into basing the 10-warhead MX weapon aboard trains on western military reservations, the sources said. The subcommittee decisions, if they are eventually affirmed by the entire <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and then the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, will set up another fight with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Although both chambers are controlled by Democrats, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense budget requests have generally fared better in the more conservative <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and Thursday's votes continued that trend The defense bills which separately pass each chamber will eventually go to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee to iron out differences. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will next week begin considering a defense budget bill which authorizes $ 4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, $ 600 million less than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, says he expects the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to approve the $ 4 billion figure after a fight by liberals who want to reduce it more and conservatives who want to raise it The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure also raises spending on the Midgetman from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request of $ 200 to about $ 500 million, while reducing the MX request from $ 800 million to $ 500 million. The Midgetman is the single-warhead missile which is backed by congressional Democrats but opposed by the Pentagon. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he wanted to eliminate the Midgetman program, but agreed to include $ 200 million at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to keep the program alive until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor can make a decision about the fate of the program.

 Italian authorities issued an arrest warrant Thursday for the leader of a Japanese terrorist group linked to the car bombing that killed an American servicewoman and four Italians outside a USO club. Meanwhile, investigators said a man arrested with explosives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> spent time in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the weeks prior to the April 14 bombing. The arrest warrant accuses <PERSON> Fusako </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON>, a 42-year-old Japanese woman, of massacre, attack on the security of the state and the transport and detention of explosive materials. Japanese officials say <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON> is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a terrorist group with ties to pro-Iranian terror groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> investigators say she acted as an accomplice in the April 14 attack, when a car filled with explosives blew up outside the <ORGANIZATION> USO </ORGANIZATION> club in downtown <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. The investigators allege that another Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist, <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, was the man who parked the car in front of the club. A warrant for his arrest was issued the day after the attack. The chief investigator, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON>, told reporters Thursday that several witnesses had spotted <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> in the days before the bombing. <PERSON> Argenio </PERSON> said three other men were believed involved in the attack.

 Gunmen who holed up in a bank after a foiled robbery in which five people died let their 42 captives go Thursday and were allowed to flee with three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers as hostages. Police said the gunmen released the hostages 15 minutes later, when they abandoned an armored car in which they left the bank for a stolen pickup truck and station wagon. Hostage <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON>, who drove the armored car, said only five gunmen fled, one of whom had an arm wound. `` I think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment of leaving the bank,'' said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>, 20. Most police officers had withdrawn from around the bank just before the seven men left, apparently as part of an agreement ending the 24-hour standoff. <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON> said the robbers had `` goats horns -LRB- sawed-off machine guns -RRB-, ammunition and dynamite sticks.'' When the armored car had roared away, a policemen shouted to hundreds of people outside the branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>: `` Thanks to you, the hostages are safe!'' Spectators had urged officials to end the crisis peacefully and some had shouted `` Freedom, freedom!'' in support of the gunmen. Gov. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> network's afternoon news program the agreement allowed police to pursue the gunmen `` We're not deceiving anyone,'' the governor said. `` We simply reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.'' The 42 hostages were taken to a hospital in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> ambulances. Soldiers were seen checking vehicles on highways leading from the city. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, a spokesman for the governor, said the gunmen demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air. Police said the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no political motives. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said there were no injuries in a shooting incident Thursday morning when the gunmen grabbed weapons from a pickup truck outside the bank. News reports had said one gunman was wounded by police gunfire. The standoff in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>, a city of 120,000 on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted police to the attempted robbery. Bank robberies and other crime has increased in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1982, when an economic crisis caused by plummeting oil prices began to erode purchasing power and drive up unemployment. <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> is known as a crime center, particularly involving the illegal drug trade. Red Cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15 wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing standoff. They said the gunmen freed two men and two women Thursday morning. Hundreds of police had surrounded the bank. `` We are all going to die,'' one gunmen said by telephone to a radio station in <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state. `` Let them give us the helicopter ... or we are going to blow up all of this. ... We do n't want innocent people to die, but if we are going to die innocent people are going to as well,'' said the man, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> had offered in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> to let the gunmen meet with a committee of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials, journalists, a Roman Catholic priest and state police to guarantee safety and due process of law. Another gunman, in an interview <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> broadcast Thursday morning, said all the hostages were being treated well. Asked where they could go if given safe passage, he replied: `` I would n't be able to tell you where we could go. We ca n't turn ourselves in. They want to kill us.'' Hostages told the media by telephone during the siege the gunmen were getting them food and beverages. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, a spokesman for the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said one of its rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday between police and the gunmen. He said the others slain were a customer, bank official and teller, and a policeman who was in the bank on business at the time of the robbery and tried to prevent it.

 The hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner originally planned to land in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, blow up the plane and keep the passengers hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mediator in the hijacking was quoted as saying Thursday. <PERSON> Malaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the plan failed because Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Assad </PERSON> refused to let the plane land in the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital, according to by <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Paese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power-broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has been torn by 12 years of civil war. <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON> acted as a mediator in negotiations with the hijackers when the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet landed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paese </PERSON> <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> released excerpts of an interview to be published Friday.

 Two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn operators were fined $ 600,000 each by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for transmitting obscene material across state lines and for not restricting access to their messages to children and non-consenting adults. `` Some so-called dial-a-porn providers are blatantly disregarding the law which required that access by minors be restricted pursuant to commission regulation,'' <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said in announcing the fines. `` We intend to enforce this law.'' The companies, <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, were fined for interstate transmission of obscene material and failure to restrict such transmissions from minors and non-consenting adults. The maximum fine is $ 50,000 for each day of violation. `` The ultimate in sleeze deserves the ultimate ... penalty,'' <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said. `` They need to know we mean business.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> common carrier bureau, said the $ 600,000 fines were based on the amount of money the companies made during the commission's monitoring process. In an 11-month period, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T received $ 5.5 million from calls made to one <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> line, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. Of that amount, <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> received $ 650,000, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> received $ 297,000 from its operation. The decision was the result of an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> investigation triggered by complaints alleging that unimpeded access to the sexually explicit messages resulted in the molestation of one 10-year-old girl and so disturbed a 16-year-old boy that he had to enter weekly psychiatric theraphy. The companies have 30 days to pay or seek reduction of the fines. Current FCC regulations direct the dial-a-porn companies to restrict their messages through access codes, message scrambling or use of credit card numbers. Upon being notified last December of the complaints, both companies said they did not have the capacity to provide access screening and denied that the messages were obscene. <PERSON> Intercambio </PERSON> also argued that it had not violated the regulation because it never intended to transmit to minors or on an interstate basis. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said its policy was `` to terminate service at the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s direction for any customer found in violation of laws concerning minor access to pornographic messages.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> paid $ 86,684 in 1987 income taxes on a total income of $ 308,396, according to a tax return released by his office on Thursday. That compares to the $ 115,486 that the Bushes reported paying for 1986 on total income of $ 348,594. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax bill amounted to 28 percent of his total income in 1987, down from the 33 percent he paid in 1986, showing that he, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and many other Americans, benefited from the sweeping tax-law changes that took effect for 1987 taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s income included his $ 112,633 salary as vice president and $ 2,048 in additional reimbursment from the government. His biggest chunk of outside income came from the blind trust he and his wife set up when he took office, totaling $ 169,600 _ including $ 26,075 in capital gains, $ 31,264 in interest and dividends and $ 112,261 in supplemental income. Precisely where this money came from was not detailed, under terms of the blind trust agreement. Aides have said previously that the trust is valued at about $ 1 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reported $ 20,773 in `` passive income'' from his interest in a liquefied natural gas barge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s salary was up from the $ 97,900 he received in 1986, reflecting a general raise in federal salaries. The main reason his total income was lower was because he had a much lower level of capital gains _ income from sales of assets, property or stock. In 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported total capital gains of $ 430,165, apparently reflecting a decision by the trustees of his blind trust to sell off assets before the new tax law changes took effect and increased the tax on such gains. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made returning to a lower rate of taxation on capital gains a prime campaign theme, saying the decision to tax capital gains at the same rate as other earnings stifles business investment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a capital gains tax of 15 percent. The Bushes claimed total deductions for 1987 of $ 53,314, including $ 12,225 in contributions to 35 charities. The contributions included $ 1,000 gifts to the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had made $ 89,588 in tax payments, including $ 32,588 withheld from his salary _ suggesting a refund of $ 2,904. However, the vice president elected to have the money held and applied to his 1988 taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reported $ 1,575 in royalties in 1987 on his book, `` Looking Forward,'' published by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON> last September. The vice president claimed $ 3,574 in deductions for business meals and entertainment and $ 6,880 in miscellaneous business deductions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has released his tax returns annually. In January, he also released 14 years of previous returns in a challenge to then-rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to do the same. Those returns showed that 1986 was his biggest income year, and that over the 14-year period he paid taxes ranging from 3 percent to 41 percent of his annual income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s interest income included $ 66 from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> credit union.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> launched a fresh attack Thursday on Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, played down talk of his own potential as a vice presidential candidate and courted blue-collar workers in a campaign visit here. Campaigning in advance of Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, the Democratic presidential contender cited the longstanding legal controversy surrounding <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` I want a Justice Department that stands for justice ... an attorney general that goes back and forth to court as a prosecutor for the people and not as a defender for himself,'' he said in a speech. At a news conference afterward, <PERSON> Jackon </PERSON> declined to comment on his chances of being named the vice presidential nominee. Some of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s top associates, including campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, have been raising the possibility of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a running mate for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emerged victorious in the struggle for the nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> he said he intends to do nothing to damage the party's chances of winning the presidency in November `` I seek to be a healer in this process, and a builder,'' he said. The candidate delivered the message of `` economic justice'' that has been a mainstay of his campaign. `` Profits are up, wages are down, factories are closing, and workers are abandoned,'' he told a crowd of about 4,000 people who huddled together and shivered in a downtown park as a cold wind blew off nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. `` Let's rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and put the workers back to work ... Do n't let the voices of the status quo break your spirit,'' he said. In other campaign contests, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been boosted by a coalition of economically struggling workers, farmers and students, and he was going after that mix here. `` I think that jobs for blue-collar workers is a very important issue at this time,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidler </PERSON>, 54, of Erie, a registered Republican. `` I believe he is for the people,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, 53, an Erie machine shop manager. `` He knows what the people really need.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he supports changes in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to make the agency a mediation service and not `` a strike-breaking board.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also brushed aside his defeat at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hands in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday. `` I always run against great odds,'' he said, adding that his campaign in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was `` very much alive.'' From Erie, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where he toured a drug-infested area.

 The crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane shot down by Soviet fighters in 1983 negligently made the flight knowing the navigation system was not working, a lawyer for the victims' relatives argued Thursday <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Madole </PERSON>, lead counsel for a committee that represents the relatives of those killed in the Sept. 1, 1983 crash of Flight 007, said there was abundant evidence to show that the crew chose to continue the flight even though it determined in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> that the navigation system was not properly set before takeoff from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. A total of 269 passengers and crew died when the flight, which originated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was shot down over the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after straying off course into Soviet air space. The plane `` ended up 320 miles off course'' because the inertial navigation system -LRB- INS -RRB- had been improperly set during a fueling stop in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. `` From the moment that airplane took off it was never, never on course,'' he told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` The crew deliberately attempted to conceal their failure to either properly stabilize the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> or set it up properly,'' <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. The pilot and crew knew the journey without navigation guides would lead the plane into a dangerous area where it could be shot down without warning if it strayed into Soviet airspace, <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. `` Obviously the crew knew the danger and chanced it anyway,'' he said. But KAL attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said these allegations were based on `` opinion, surmise, conjecture'' rather than evidence. `` There is no need for a trial in this case,'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> told <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who has presided over five years of litigation arising from the crash. <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said the plaintiffs should be given a chance to press their claim of punitive damages at a trial. Even before the flight had left the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for the long journey across open seas, the crew had violated a number of aviation regulations, <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. The plane should have flown directly over the radio beacon at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to check its position when the crew determined it was 15 miles off course, <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. But the crew members ignored their duty and did n't fly the plane over the radio beacon because they knew the navigational system was not functioning. Once the plane passed over the coast, `` there is no white highway line across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Byung-in </PERSON>, wanted to avoid returning to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to reset the nevigation system because such an emergency landing would force him to dump 100,000 pounds of jet fuel. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> knew this costly and time-consuming detour would anger airline officials and passengers, <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. He cited the deposition testimony of former <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON> who said he and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> had spoken the night before the ill-fated flight about four other incidents that year in which <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> crews had made emergency landings to reset navigation systems. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> had told Park `` if it happened to him he would go on'' to avoid losing face with his superiors and friends, <PERSON> Madole </PERSON> said. `` It would be a terrible disgrace in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> if they have to come back.'' Authorities have not been able to determine exactly how the plane ended up 320 miles off course because the cockpit and flight data recorders were never recovered. But aviation experts theorize that incorrect data was punched into the computerized navigation system before the plane took off from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. If the judge dismisses the case, the airline would only be liable for $ 75,000 per passenger under international aviation conventions. But the plaintiffs are seeking to collect far greater amounts by holding the airline liable for punitive damages.

 A man who threatened to loose a 500-pound <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger on the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus unless given a job `` snapped'' and deserves compassion, the school's basketball coach said Thursday. Coach <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> signed a $ 10,000 bail bond to free from jail <PERSON> Moacyr </PERSON> `` Gato'' <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON>, who locked himself in the outer cage of the LSU mascot for more than four hours Wednesday. Cezar, 48, was charged with criminal mischief and robbery. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> last summer had befriended <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON>, who worked in <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>'s basketball dorm and had demanded to speak to the coach during the standoff `` What happened to Gato could have happened to any of us,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> was freed from jail and taken to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation. `` His personal problems were overwhelming and he snapped.'' School officials wo n't make any decisions about <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON>'s future until the charge is settled, said university spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crain </PERSON>. The man filled out a job application during Wednesday's standoff, but officials made no guarantees. <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON>, a former star Brazilian basketball player, was befriended by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> when the coach visited <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paolo </LOCATION> last summer. He was a teacher in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and came to this country on a temporary visa. He supervised the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> basketball dormitory while taking courses to improve his English. Cezar, a father of two, needed money to send to his family and wanted a work permit because his visa was expiring, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` He is a frustrated, proud man who was just looking for a job, who did n't want charity,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Cezar seized the cage keys from a student trainer Wednesday, threatening the man with what turned out to be a toy gun, officials said. He entered only the barred outer cage that surrounds the main cage containing the tiger. An <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> basketball player <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, a native of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, talked Cezar out of the cage. At one point during the standoff, some of the hundreds of students who came to watch chanted: `` Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry raised at <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> sporting events when opposing teams enter. `` To those of you who shouted ` Tiger bait,' what can I say?'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` May you never experience sadness and loneliness and may you find a love that you could n't give last night.''

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday he meets the highest ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no factor `` right now that would cause me to resign.'' But the attorney general, in an interview published in Friday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, did not rule out resigning before the end of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term `` I've never set a particular limit of how long I would stay or how long I would n't stay. A lot would depend upon my own post-federal service employment situation and so on,'' he said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he does not believe he is a liability either to the administration or to the presidential bid of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I do n't feel that I'm tainted _ I feel that there have been false accusations and false charges,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been under criminal investigation for nearly a year by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who is looking into his ties to the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is also known to be looking into Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s $ 40,000-a-year job with the Multiple Sclerosis Society Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary is underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a tax-exempt philanthropy run by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate family. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that a partnership headed by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, the foundation's vice president, owned a building for which the government signed a $ 50 million lease for a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office building in May 1987. Thirteen days after signing the lease, the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership sold the building for a $ 22.6 million profit. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and said he did n't have anything to do with the lease. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined to answer whether he would resign if his presence in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet became a liability for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he said the only reason an attorney general should resign is if he is indicted or if the president asks him to step down. `` I do n't know of any factor right now that would cause me to resign,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. He said public officials should meet the highest ethical standards and added, `` I personally believe that, in my case, I meet that standard and that's why I'm interested in having the facts come out.'' The president has continued to express his `` total support ... and total confidence,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he usually meets with his personal lawyer after work or on Sundays: `` It ... is not taking me away from the office during office hours hardly at all, and in no way is it hampering the decision-making of the department.''

 The 1988 Democratic presidential marathon dwindled down to two survivors on Thursday as Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called it quits. Front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showing guarantees him consideration when it comes to picking a vice presidential running mate, but nothing more. `` If I were to finish second, it would n't entitle me to anything more than consideration, period,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before he flew off to campaign in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the next primary states on the calendar. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the day in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, buoyed by an endorsement from the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am the alternative in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. I am the alternative to Reaganomics,'' he said as he made the rounds on a hectic campaign day. `` We can win. We can win,'' he said. The ubiquitous public opinion polls suggested otherwise. A survey taken for television stations in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favored by 55 percent to 24 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 6 percent for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. That represented an improvement in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position since his big victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, which established his control over the presidential race. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> votes next week and offers 178 Democratic delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> at his side, toured a neighborhood notorious for drug sales on Thursday night, calling on hundreds of blacks and Hispanics who turned out to see him to stay away from drugs. `` When I become president, the drug pusher is in trouble,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> to campaign in advance of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s primary, a week after the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> contest He made a strong attack on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration trade and labor policies. `` We have a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that wo n't stand up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because we have got an attorney general who could n't tell the difference between anti-trust and antifreeze,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, meanwhile, exited the race with a quip. `` I was going great until I turned 40,'' he told a roomful of family members and supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said he would technically remain a candidate so his delegates can attend the Democratic National Convention this July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But, he said, `` I will no longer campaign in the hope of winning the nomination. ... I want no part of a stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or stop <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> movement. `` The only person I want to stop is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and we're going to stop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is clearly heading for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination, and the only suspense is when he will amass the 1,139 delegates needed for clinching it. The best guess is Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who sought the nomination as a Southern, moderate alternative to the other contenders, left the campaign at least $ 1.5 million in debt after failing to build on his Southern successes in any Northern or Midwestern states. His campaign had soared March 8 on Super Tuesday when he carried <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and he holds more than 400 delegates in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. Under <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rules, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have gained 34 of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegates right away and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have gotten 29 if <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had made a clean break and dropped out of the race entirely. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads in the delegate chase with more than 1,000 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> holds more than 800. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is the prohibitive favorite for the nomination, given his delegate lead and the momentum he gained with his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> triumph. But in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, he said it was too early to talk of picking a running mate. `` I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it's pretty well in hand,'' he said. Even so, he seemed to brush aside a prediction from party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> that the vice presidential running mate would be a senator from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or Southwest. `` I would n't make that judgement at all,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't ready to discuss the issue, others were. `` Obviously you look at regions where you could use some help,'' said former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` The South and West are the regions. You also look at a philosophical segment where you could use some shoring up and I guess that would be with moderate conservative voters.'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, who had urged Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to run for president, said he would like to see <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> as the vice presidential candidate but only if the senator were offered the opportunity to serve as secretary of defense at the same time.

 After 6 -LCB- years and an expense of $ 500,000, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> have a jury finding that they were slandered _ and a buck apiece in their pockets. `` I got my name cleared,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Wednesday after jurors ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, 73, slandered the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> during a disagreement over funds that was aired at a symphony board meeting in August 1981. All three were involved in fund-raising and operations of the symphony, a central part of the social scene in socially conscious <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 59, worked as treasurer for the symphony in 1981. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, 72, was on the board of directors. So it caused something of an uproar in the posh resort community when Mrs. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, accused each other of misappropriating symphony property and money. Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> sued the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> for defamation. The Hugheses countersued Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> agreed to settle her lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> out of court in December last year when <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' insurance company offered $ 150,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> plan to appeal that settlement. `` We spent over a half-million dollars,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, referring to their own lawsuit. In return for their time and expense, a jury awarded the couple $ 2 in damages. At that 1981 meeting, Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told the board _ in view of television cameras _ that the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION> had improperly handled symphony money. During the two-week trial, jurors watched tapes of the statements, which her lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> made after consulting with an attorney. After Palm Beach Circuit Judge <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> read the verdict Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said she thought she had been advised before the meeting by the best law firm in town. Despite the victory in principle for the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION>, trial analyst <PERSON> Kus </PERSON> <PERSON> Nell </PERSON>, who assisted attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> in representing the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION>, thought the six jurors ignored the damage done to the <ORGANIZATION> Hugheses </ORGANIZATION>' when they determined the $ 2 award. `` I'm stunned how $ 1 will compensate Mr. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> said, noting how much more Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> reaped in December from the out-of-court settlement by the insurance company. `` She never went to trial, she never proved a thing, and she got $ 150,000,'' <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> said. `` We went to court for two weeks and got this.'' The trial attracted attention for the years of bitterness and thick volumes of court documents it has generated. After the charges and countercharges were made in 1981, the <PERSON> Hugheses </PERSON> told the state attorney's office that symphony records and $ 100,000 in cash and donations were missing. After seven months of scrutiny, investigators criticized sloppy accounting procedures but found nothing of criminal substance.

 A 2-month-old baby found dead in a trash can Thursday was drowned by his mother the day she told police two men had snatched him from his stroller on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street, police said. <PERSON> Lucrezia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 36, was charged with murder in the death of her son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. She was awaiting arraignment Thursday night. The infant's body was discovered not far from the family home after a day of questioning in which the mother was given a polygraph test and told detectives where to find the baby, said Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON>. `` We believe that <PERSON> Lucrezia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> drowned her 2-month-old son <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> in the bathtub of their residence at approximately 9:30 a.m. yesterday,'' <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> then `` dressed the baby, placed him in a white plastic bag, put him in his stroller, walked several blocks ... and placed the baby in a green trash can,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 32, is a part-time employee of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office, had told police the baby was taken from his stroller Wednesday by two men in a sedan who had stopped her to ask directions. She said the abduction occurred as she was on her way to the grammar school attended by her 7-year-old son. About an hour earlier, Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> had said, a woman had called to say the son was ill at the school. Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, a police spokesman, had said shortly before the baby was found that no ranson demand had been made and police had no leads on who took the baby or why. A $ 5,000 reward was posted earlier Thursday by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a retired firefighter and longtime resident of the Gentiles' neighborhood `` I want the return of the baby, that's the important thing,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> had said. `` I just hope they do n't compound kidnapping with murder.'' `` I feel violated and so do my neighbors,'' said <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. `` You should see the parents today, holding onto their children, hollering at their children. The parents are scared.'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> has worked as a guard for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal's office for about a year, said Chief Deputy Marshal <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> had retired with a disability from the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> police force in 1984.

 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>'s `` junk bond'' business, who is under scrutiny in the Wall Street insider trading scandals, was subpoenaed by a congressional panel Thursday to testify next week, sources said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, Calif.-based architect of the nation's $ 100 billion `` junk bond'' market of debt securities that frequently are used to finance hostile takeover attempts, is scheduled to testify April 27 before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The chief executive officer of the investment banking firm, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, is scheduled to testify next Thursday, but a subpoena was not considered necessary in his case, one source said. `` <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> did not want to appear,'' the source said, adding that the subcommittee, led by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., then decided to issue a subpoena for him <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, the attorney at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> office who sources said received the subpoena for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, was not in his office Thursday afternoon and queries were directed to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, the firm's spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Asked about the subpoena, <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said, `` We ca n't confirm it, but we anticipate hearing next week.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> still is gripped by a `` climate of fear'' and building democracy will be difficult. `` No change can be made without resistance. Change does not take place in one day,'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said during his first news conference since taking office Feb. 7. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> also said that a government investigation into the violence that forced the cancellation of the Nov. 19 presidential election is going slowly. The investigaton had not reached any conclusions about who was behind the rampage that left 34 people dead, he said. `` We are simply lacking witnesses who have the courage to testify,'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said. `` The climate of fear from the time of the <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION> still exists.'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> took power in 1957 and ruled until 1971, when his son <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> took control. The younger <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986, in the face of widespread opposition. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was elected Jan. 17 in a government-run election boycotted by the main opposition parties. The Nov. 19 balloting was called off after gunmen shot into lines of voters at polling stations and other assailants hacked people to death. Witnesses said soldiers took part in the shooting, and main opposition candidates said the military organized the bloodshed to ruin the election, the first free balloting in three decades. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> tacitly anknowledged critics' complaints that the army still runs <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` This government has had an unquestionable desire to change things, but we ca n't break big interests and bad habits overnight,'' he said. But <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> he contended that his government is an improvement. `` We in the government are men of dialogue. Nobody will make us fall into the trap of the <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION>, pushing us to repressive tactics to stay in power,'' he said. He repeated his intention `` to put the army at the service of development.'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> had no comment on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last month of army Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is commander of the powerful <PERSON> Dessalines </PERSON> battalion of 700 soldiers quartered next to the National Palace.

 A grand jury indicted 10 men Thursday in an alleged kidnapping and gang rape March 26 of a young woman who told police that bystanders at a cockfight ignored her cries and joined in the attack. `` We got everything we wanted,'' <ORGANIZATION> Duvall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said in announcing the indictments.

The 19-year-old woman, a mother of two, told authorities she was abducted while walking home from a relative's house and gang raped over four hours. She said the attack began at a ranch north of town where a cockfight was being held. She said her attackers urged men at the cockfight to join in, and some did, despite her pleas for help.

 Riot troops hurled tear gas grenades and fired in the air Thursday night to break up a group of demonstrators headed for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The protesters had been part of a crowd of 1,500 to 2,000 people who marched peacefully to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier Thursday to demonstrate against the Honduran government and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in this Central American country. Two weeks ago protesters attacked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound, burning and sacking the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. Five people were killed in that riot, which was fueled by indignation over the deportation of an alleged drug trafficker to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thursday night, about 200 people shouting `` Embassy, Embassy'' broke off from a larger group of protesters and headed for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic mission on the eastern outskirts of this capital. About 50 soldiers and police threw tear-gas grenades, dispersing the protesters. The demonstrators regrouped, cutting off a small contingent of what appeared to be young and ill-trained troops, who fired long bursts of fire from their M-16s into the air. The sound of shots sparked panic in the neighborhood. Some demonstrators taunted and threw stones at the troopers, who at intervals would advance behind metal shields. At least one person was seen arrested. There were no immediate reports of injuries. During the milelong march earlier Thursday, protesters chanted slogans calling for the expulsion of the approximately 1,100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the removal of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and the defense of the Honduran Constitution. They condemned the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> and what they called his subservience to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Yankee garbage, out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' and `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> do n't get out, in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> they will die,'' shouted the demonstrators Both chants rhyme in Spanish. The marchers, most of them students, walked to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where they listened to speeches condemning <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 500 demonstrators proceeded from there to the nearby <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>, where they shouted for the release of inmates they consider political prisoners. A group then tried to go to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. One of the issues the marchers protested was the forced extradition of suspected drug trafficker <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>. Honduran police, working with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents, arrested <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> home on April 5 had him flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of Honduran citizens. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is in federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> estimates damage to the consulate building in the April 7 riot at between $ 4 million and $ 6 million and has asked for reimbursement from the government.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said farewell to the White House press corps Thursday night, saying he hoped the epitaph for his sometimes strained relationship with the media will be `` he gave as good as he got.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave the sentimental goodbye during his seventh and last White House Correspondents Association dinner appearance, after joking about the recent spate of books from former aides, the presidential campaign and the treatment he's gotten from the press corps. Looking over the crowd of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> elected officials, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and celebrity guests from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, he said, `` It looks like the index of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' book.'' He noted that <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had criticized his mental powers, when <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said in his recently published book that preparing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a press conference was like `` reinventing the wheel.'' `` I was around when the wheel was invented,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Even -LRB- White House chief of staff -RRB- <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is writing a book. It's going to be called ` Three By Five: the Measure of a President,''' he said, in a reference to his use of index cards in meetings. And joking about the frequent complaints that he does not hold enough meetings with the press, he said the presidential campaign has left him `` feeling a little lonely.'' `` I've been so desperate for attention, I almost considered holding a news conference,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. After the jokes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave a warmhearted toast, applauded by the press corps and guests, `` to this God-blessed land.'' He said presidents and the press could agree and work together `` to keep this great miracle alive because the world is a better place because of us. To the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said, raising his glass. `` Every president seeks to use the press,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The press can take care of itself and hopefully so can a president. I hope that my epitaph will be with relations with the White House press corps, ` He gave as good as he got.''' Several journalism awards were handed out at the annual dinner. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seib </PERSON>, White House correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, won two awards for his stories on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's approach to the December 1987 summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seib </PERSON> was presented the <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Award and the <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> Award.

<TEXT>
 At least three <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police officers were killed Friday in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, apparently by Melanesian separatists, the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. The station, reporting from <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the capital, quoted government radio as saying the gendarmes were shot on the outer island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, 90 miles away. It said a town hall was set alight earlier Friday in the French-ruled territory and a small bomb exploded in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the earlier attacks. The territory's indigenous Melanesians have vowed to boycott Sunday's regional elections which coincide with the French presidential election.

 Fired <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has defended the outspoken criticism of the slow pace of reform that cost him his job, telling the official press that he did what he thought was right. In another published report, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the Kremlin No. 2 man considered a conservative counterforce to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership, was reported to be in trouble with the Soviet leader. The respected <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> had been removed from his duties as the party's chief arbiter on ideological issues and head of party workers at an April 16 meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the Politburo voted to reduce <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s powers and ordered him to take a two-month vacation. It said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was forced to give up his role as a supervisor of Soviet press and television. The paper said that <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, had defended <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> during the Politburo meeting, which it said took place Tuesday. Unconfirmed reports circulating in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> recently had been given a reprimand by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but it was unclear when or why. The interview with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, along with a large picture of him and his grandson, was published in the first German-language edition of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which appeared Thursday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The article was not in the weekly Russian language edition that came out Wednesday. `` I spoke in a straightforward manner and said what I felt and thought was correct,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said in the interview, his first in the official press since his firing. `` Someone said correctly: each must think independently so that later not all suddenly see the light at once.'' He declined to say what he told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at an Oct. 21 meeting that led to his firing three weeks later. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was hospitalized with heart trouble in November, and since has been reassigned as a first deputy minister of construction. Even though <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News is intended primarily for foreigners, the appearance of an interview with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was unusual and could be a signal that he has recovered some prestige following his denunciation by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in mid-November for putting `` personal ambitions above the interests of the party.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, was considered to be among the staunchest supporters of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform the Soviet economy and allow more openness. In his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he criticized the slow pace of reform and the party's style of leadership. Some unconfirmed reports have said he attacked <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> personally. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was replaced as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief by <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>. In February, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was stripped of his position as a candidate, or non-voting, member of the ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s firing was taken by some <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intellectuals as an indication of the limits of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged that in a speech to writers and artists in January, but denied that it signaled a slowing of his reform efforts. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> industrial city of <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> to replace <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Grishin </PERSON>, reported to be <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s main rival for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said 102,000 copies of the first German-language edition were printed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and sold at kiosks. It said editors in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> provide all the material for the paper, which is composed, printed and distributed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It is printed in a larger format than the editions printed in five other languages. In its story on <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON> cited unidentified informed <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> sources as saying the Politburo turned over his duties to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, secretary of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the party's chief director of propaganda, press and cultural matters. The paper's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent described the action as a `` failure of the political operation against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'' by conservative party figures who attracted attention following the publication of a newspaper article defending Stalinist policies. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was said to have endorsed the article and guided through its publication in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda published a strongly worded condemnaton of the critical article April 5. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has indicated in speeches on ideology during the past year that he favors a less permissive attitude toward openness in publishing than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Conservative writers have cited <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s speeches in attacking the increasingly critical articles that are appearing in Soviet newspapers, including <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News.

 A computer hacker who sent messages to Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>'s computer can not be prosecuted under the country's counterfeiting and forgery laws, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest court ruled Thursday <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifreen </PERSON> were arrested separately in 1985 for breaking into the Prestel system, the information service of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's telephone company. Gold, of <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Schifreen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, were convicted in 1986 of nine offenses and fined $ 1,140 and $ 1,425, respectively.

If it is thought desirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislature rather than the courts.'' `` I knew from the start that the Forgery Act is not designed to apply to unauthorized access to computers and that has now been proved,'' said <PERSON> Schifreen </PERSON>. `` I am not saying computer hacking should be legal, but there should be a specific law to cover it.'' He said the messages left on Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>'s computer were not `` terribly interesting,'' mostly congratulations on the birth of his grandson <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON>, the elder son of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Second Jury Finds Man Guilty In Death Of Girlfriend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who led the search for his girlfriend after she disappeared while they jogged in a park was convicted of voluntary manslaughter Wednesday in her slaying. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, 27, could receive up to 11 years in prison at sentencing June 1 in the 1984 slaying of 21-year-old <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> `` Bibi'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who was found bludgeoned to death and buried n a shallow grave in Redwood Regional Park. Page remained free on his own recognizance. He was acquitted two years ago of murdering <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> but was ordered retried after the jury deadlocked 8-4 in favor of a manslaughter conviction. The trial centered on a statement Page gave police in which he said he had bashed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s head repeatedly with a rock after a lover's quarrel and dragged her body into the woods, then made love to the corpse before scooping dirt and leaves over it with a hubcap. Page took the stand to renounce his confession as the ramblings of a young man exhausted by hours of grueling questioning. He had told officers he thought he had two personalities, one of which could have committed the crime and blocked it out. According to testimony, the couple and a friend had gone jogging in the park. The friend became separated from <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and Page, but waited for them at a park gate. Page arrived alone and said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had gone down a different path. He said he had looked for her unsuccessfully for about 15 minutes. When one of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s roommates called Page the next day to say <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had not returned, he reported her disappearance to police and during the next five weeks distributed flyers with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s picture and description to news agencies. A month later, her half-nude body was found buried in a thicket.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Wednesday for freeing the gunmen who hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and killed two <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> passengers. `` They will have gone back into the mainstream of terrorism, and we can assume we have not heard the last of them. That is cause for concern in the airline industry,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, association security director. `` We now have the possibility that a number of trained hijackers could lead missions of their own,'' <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The 15-day-long hijacking ended Wednesday with the release of 31 hostages. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> allowed the pro-Iranian hijackers to escape. The terrorists, reportedly nine in number, had demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists convicted and imprisoned for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in December 1983. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is not a signatory to the international convention on hijacking, which calls on authorities to secure the safe release of passengers, recovery of the aircraft, and apprehension or extradition of the hijackers. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> succeeded in the first two parts but not the third. `` There was a requirement for all three processes,'' said <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, a former executive at <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our worries are now that you've got people who have experienced the seizure of an aircraft and the holding of hostages over a lengthy period, and they are now back in circulation.'' He noted reports that the hijackers told some of their hostages that the plane seizure was only the first of a series of planned hijackings. The Algerians should have negotiated from strength since the hijacking had gone for so long and the terrorists must have realized they could not achieve their goal, he added. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association representing 170 international airlines and headquartered in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, is investigating how the Kuwaiti aircraft was seized while it was en route from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. It has asked Thai authorities for permission to send a team to review security operations at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. `` We are awaiting a formal response.'' He said information received by the association indicates security was lax on the day of the hijacking but there is `` no definitive conclusion as to where the weapons went on board. The association has called for the establishment of an international court to try hijackers, an international detention center to jail them, and an international force to negotiate with hijackers and to mount a rescue attempt if talks fail.

 For three centuries, language has divided <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s two founding cultures. The novelist <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> prophetically called it the `` Two Solitudes'' of English and French. Despite some progress toward bilingualism at a federal level as promised in the 1982 constitution, language tensions have flared anew from French-speaking <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> to the western prairies, where English is dominant. A fluently bilingual Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, about to start his re-election campaign, has suddenly found himself diverted into quelling anglophone and francophone unrest. Three issues have converged to create the new turmoil: _ The province of <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> has repealed an 1886 act requiring it to issue laws in both English and French <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> is expected to do the same. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is about to rule on <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s controversial ban on English signs Quebec is 81-percent French but the vocal English minority in `` la belle province'' claims the ban violates freedom of speech and is unconstitutional. _ <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> faces opposition from members of his own <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the west over a proposed new Official Languages Act that would strengthen bilingualism in federal courts and institutions `` The populace will be seething and smarting as it pays for bureaucrats who communicate with one another in a language -LRB- French -RRB- which close to four out of five Canadians can not understand,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Byfield </PERSON>, publisher of Western Report magazine. Trying to balance historic sensitivities in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> with the need to keep his base of support in the west, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s first prime minister in 1867 had to handle the linguistic rift `` and I'm sure it will be the case 120 years from now.'' `` Language issues will always be there to trouble and upset us and even to divide us,'' he said. At stake for <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is the <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION> he negotiated with all 10 provinces last year, bringing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> into the constitutional fold as a `` distinct society'' and purporting to protect the rights of linguistic minorities elsewhere. Several provinces have balked at ratifying the deal and now complain that the accord reached at <LOCATION> Meech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> rings hollow when put to the test. Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> came in for particularly harsh criticism during visits in mid-April to <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, neighbors on the prairies. He refused to condemn the provinces for not honoring a Feb. 25 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that said their laws should be issued in both English and French under an 1886 statute. The historic failure to provide laws in French had prompted a French-speaking priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercure </PERSON>, to contest a <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> speeding ticket. He died before the case reached the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but it was a pyrrhic victory for the province's 25,000 francophones since the court suggested that <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> could repeal the old law and replace it with an English-only policy That's exactly what Premier <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> has done, arguing that the province can not afford to re-enact all laws in French. In the province of just over 1 million people, only 25,000 speak French, and they also speak English. Pressed to intervene, <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> told reporters: `` I am not a federal politician. I was not elected to represent <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ares </PERSON>, a francophone leader in <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>, blasted the premier as `` a traitor'' to the French cause outside <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. `` He's backpedalling,'' added <PERSON> Aurele </PERSON> <PERSON> Theriault </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francophones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Federation des francophones hors <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> chose to praise <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> for pledging to translate some laws into French and permit use of the language in the courts and <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, while setting up language classes for civil servants. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, meanwhile, told <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> that his actions had national implications and offered federal funds for expanding bilingualism in the province. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> is also under pressure at home, where he pledged in his 1985 election campaign to lift the ban on bilingual signs. But when an English department store, <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>'s, was firebombed last year after adding English to its signs, <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> retreated for the sake of what he termed `` social peace.'' With the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on signs pending, federal Languages Commissioner <PERSON> D'Iberville </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> stirred the controversy by accusing the French in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> of `` humiliating'' their English neighbors. <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, president of the English-rights pressure group <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION>, maintained that a new language crisis could prompt the exodus of 100,000 Quebec English speakers, who are a major economic force in the province. `` Frankly, I do n't think <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> can sustain that kind of loss.'' On another front, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s culture minister, <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, proposed new film distribution laws tightly restricting the number of English-language movies that can be screened in the province. Meanwhile, the government insists that its new Official Languages Act is merely an attempt to comply with the constitution, not a means of enforcing compulsory bilingualism in regions where it's not wanted. But opponents claim every federal court and agency will be required to have bilingual judges and staff, and those unable to speak French will be bypassed for jobs and promotions. `` It's a tragedy,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindy </PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. `` I think <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> is moving more and more towards unilingualism and the rest of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is going to be forced to be more and more bilingual.'' To French-Canadians, whose ancestors arrived in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> before the British, language preservation is their birthright. `` If the rights of francophones had been respected since the last century, maybe there would n't be so few of us now,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyr </PERSON> of the Acadian Federation of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, which has about 31,000 French speakers. `` Francophones have just as much right to be here as anglophones. We founded the country too.'' Ironically, all three major political parties support bilingualism as do major newspapers. But in the world's second most spacious country, the language issue falls victim to demographics. Of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 25 million people, about 6.2 million speak French. But 5.3 million of those live in one province, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, where French is the sole official language and a majority never speak English. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, the province bordering <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, is one-third French and the nation's only officially bilingual province. Of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>'s 9.3 million people, 425,000 are francophones West of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>, however, not even one in 10 of the area's 6.7 million people lists <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> as their native tongue. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> promoted bilingualism to defuse the separatist movement in his native Quebec, and English and French were declared the official federal languages in 1969. Federal documents are issued in both languages, government departments have bilingual names, and unilingual civil servants are paid to take language classes. In cities such as <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, anglophone parents have enrolled 200,000 children in French immersion schools, the most promising sign of real change. But in most regions, from <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, bilingualism has been slow to take root. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Levesque </PERSON>, the late premier of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, once said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> speakers in the rest of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were `` dead ducks'' who would inevitably lose out to the English majority.

<HEAD>A Little Greek Music From an Irish Cellist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> was a shaggy-haired Irish cellist when he left <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on a musical journey that followed the hippy trail to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Eighteen years later, he's an internationally acclaimed performer of traditional <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> music _ the plaintive kind that <ORGANIZATION> Westerners </ORGANIZATION> used to call `` weird'' and `` outlandish.'' `` It was n't enough, being in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and learning the sitar in a vacuum,'' the 36-year-old musician said. `` I wanted to find out how Eastern music really worked. That meant exploring, and it took a long time.'' On the road, <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> took lessons from traditional musicians wherever he could find them _ in workers' cafes or at Moslem weddings, even at the whirling dervishes' monastery at <LOCATION> Konya </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` There's a kind of camaraderie among musicians. They'd show me things, maybe not all the tricks, but enough to get me started on playing in an authentic way,'' he said. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> performs and composes on a dozen exotic stringed instruments, from the stubby Turkish `` oud,'' a member of the lute family, to the resonant Afghan `` rambaba'' and his favorite old-fashioned Cretan `` lyra.'' His two latest albums, one solo and another with an international group he formed and called <LOCATION> Lavyrinthos </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> spelling for `` labyrinth'' _ received first-rate reviews both in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and abroad. `` <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> is important for what he does to preserve the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> musical tradition ... and because he does n't just imitate, he innovates as well,'' said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> musicologist who heads <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview. A childhood spent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> what he said was `` an eclectic approach to music that meant I was n't stuck in the Western classical groove.'' His American music school training was useful for studying the structure of Oriental music and then dissecting its regional variations. `` We talk about Greek music being different from Turkish, or Syrian from <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION>, but in fact they're all part of a common musical tradition that stretches all the way from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and goes back centuries,'' he said. That's what <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> and his group _ which includes Turkish, Armenian, <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> musicians _ tries to illustrate in performances that attract sell-out audiences in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> clubs and cultural centers. Their music strips down traditional Oriental themes to reveal haunting, melancholy melodies or mesmeric rhythms. `` We do n't use amplifiers and we like to play to no more than a couple of hundred people. ... That means we ca n't really be considered a good commercial proposition for a mass market,'' <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. But after a dramatic rise in record sales over the past six months, <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> is preparing another album and also working on a documentary feature about traditional east Mediterranean music for British television. His time is split between performances and recording sessions in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, a home on the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> and concert trips to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But he still travels in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> several months a year to work on his repertoire and add to his collection of several hundred Oriental instruments. Among Greek composers and instrumentalists, who regret the loss of skilled techniques as the local music-making tradition declines, <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> is admired for his performing talents as well as his original work. `` He's a tremendously sensitive musician who's developed a deep feeling for our music. He extracts its essence in his compositions,'' said composer <PERSON> Manos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadjidakis </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award for scoring the film `` Never on Sunday.'' In <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> sometimes puts on a traditional black shirt to play the lyra at a village wedding which may last for 24 hours of feasting, drinking and dancing. He is famed for his ability to extract a rich, melodic tone from the pear-shaped, toy-size instrument which has three-strings and is played with a bow. `` People think the lyra is a peculiarly Cretan instrument but I've found it all over <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minor </LOCATION> and it must have been around since Byzantine times. I fell for it as soon as I heard it,'' <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. End Adv PM Tues April 26

<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal program to severely restrict pesticide use in the forests and farm lands where endangered species roam may itself be endangered because of a lack of federal dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> opened a 90-day public comment period March 9 on a plan to enforce the Endangered Species Act in areas where pesticide use overlaps with the habitat of endangered species. Remaining hearings are scheduled for April 28 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, May 3 in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, and May 6 in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The 1973 Endangered Species Act requires all federal agencies to ensure their activities or those they monitor do not harm critical wildlife habitat. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s problem, according to several officials close to the agency's program, is that it does n't have the funds to monitor and enforce pesticide restrictions. `` We do n't have the money,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We're hoping in the meantime that where there are endangered species that people would voluntarily protect them where that's possible.'' `` Most of the farmers would try to comply,'' said <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` But if one would look at the thousands of dollars it could cost, we might be asking a lot.'' <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said the presticide program `` is a joke'' without the money to monitor pesticide use and verify the presence of endangered wildlife. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION> contends the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is claiming empty coffers to avoid taking action that would affect farmers. `` I think hidden behind the excuse of money is a real reluctance on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to regulate pesticides that are seen to have a impact on agricultural production,'' he said. `` It's a lack of decisive action that plagues the agency, not a lack of resources.'' One example of an animal's potential impact on agriculture is the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> kit fox. This endangered creature roams 340,000 prime acres in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, an area with crops valued at $ 58.4 million that could be ruled off-limits to pesticides. The push to protect wildlife stems from a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> internal report that slammed the agency for failing to implement the Endangered Species Act. The report included hundreds of complaints filed by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> alleging the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had neglected to protect wildlife where pesticides are used, according to <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Asked about the report, <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said, `` What it said was that we were not implementing the Endangered Species Act for old pesticides.'' The report, coupled with criticism from environmentalists, prompted the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to propose strict regulation, within specific habitats, of any pesticide registered before 1978, <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said. Pesticides registered after 1978, when new rules required more complete chemical information, comply with the law, he said. Angry farmers last fall forced a delay of the program's scheduled February start because the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s maps of rare plants and animal habitat were inaccurate Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> wrote last October that enforcing the program based on bad maps could `` develop a backlash among pesticide users.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> plan affects 900 counties nationwide. Pesticide labels would list specific counties where chemicals could threaten endangered species. Growers then would obtain a map to determine restrictions on the chemicals' use. Violations of the law can be punishable by fines of up to $ 20,000 and one-year prison terms. Last year's plan proposed restrictions on: _ 24 chemicals for forestry use, affecting 58 plant and animal species. _ 9 mosquito larvacides affecting 78 species. _ 29 pesticides for use on rangeland affecting 182 species. _ 64 chemicals for croplands affecting 45 species. County agricultural commissioners would be a farmer's main source for chemical restriction information, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pesticide enforcement unit. As for money to implement and enforce this vast program on the local level, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said, `` That's one of the problems. Nobody in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has said anything about money. In fact, they said there is no money.'' Without federal funds, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> speculated the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would have to absorb the program's cost. The state would have to help with mapping and enforcement or divert federal funds now used for other programs. <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said it would probably take two years before the program gets into full swing.

It's work,'' said <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> on a recent visit to drizzly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I hasten to say that what we go through is nothing compared to what the veterans went through in real warfare, but I can at least appreciate it a little bit, at least a Peeping <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s perspective on being away from home in a hot place where it rains a lot and where you do n't really see civilians.'' `` Civilians'' for <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> and the rest of the cast and crew are the tourists who stay at the same <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hotel. There is no fraternizing. `` People come in waves of like two weeks in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, so there's no meaningful relationship to be struck up here,'' joked the young and single <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> `` Especially when people are in a zany kind of get-a-tan-in-two-days mentality. I mean, you ca n't even seduce anyone when they're thinking about a suntan.'' A typical 14-hour shooting day is often spent crawling around in dusty tunnels or muddy swamps. Sometimes across the island, the CBS detective series `` Magnum, P.I.'' would be filming, in a decidedly more genteel atmosphere where series stars do n't have to worry about being killed off in the name of authenticity. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> was the first casualty among the regulars on `` Tour.'' `` None of us is immune. I'm glibly sitting here munching french bread in a restaurant today, but we'll see,'' said <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, whose job is presumably safe since he has top billing. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> is deeply dedicated to the series, and frustrated by the lack of audience. `` Tour'' premiered last fall with a sophisticated, film-quality style, good writing and fine performances. But it has not prospered in the ratings. It spent most of the season opposite `` The Cosby Show'' on Thursday night at the unseemly early hour of 8 p.m. Eastern time. Its ratings improved somewhat in its new Saturday 9 p.m. time period. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> executives, who will announce the network's fall schedule in May, say they remain confident in the show. `` I still believe that if you work hard enough at something, it deserves a shot,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. `` You just wo n't believe how hard some of that stuff is to do and how dangerous _ nothing compared to what the real veterans went through. The technical advisers come out there who are veterans _ without exception before the end of their episode, they come up and say, ` We had no idea you guys worked this hard.''' The way <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> plays him, Sgt. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is a no-nonsense guy who has re-upped for the second time after finding a kind of success on the battlefield he could n't find in civilian life. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has no interest in politics, he just wants to get his men out alive. Veterans groups praised <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when it announced plans for `` Tour of Duty'' last year. The response from viewers who are veterans has been `` overwhelmingly positive,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. He said the show gets a lot of mail from veterans who say they were unable to talk about their experiences until they saw `` Tour of Duty.'' `` CBS did n't undertake this show as therapy for anybody,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. `` It was entertainment, going to be quality entertainment, and it has remained that. But in addition, it has become a great bringing together of these forces, people who had never talked about it -LRB- the war -RRB- before.'' Before `` Tour,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>'s best-known role was Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` St. Elsewhere,'' a role he thought would be a six-episode shot. But it developed into one of the most popular subplots on the critically praised series, when <PERSON> White </PERSON> turned out to be a rapist. He was later killed off. `` It made life hell in the singles bars for awhile,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said with a laugh. Before `` St. Elsewhere,'' he said, his biggest role was in a minor film `` starring a $ 70,000 <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> truck and myself _ and the truck was better than I was.''

 Driven by a mother's love and a penchant for publicity, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> defied all tradition of parental patience and forbearance in the wait for donor organs to try to save her 7-year-old son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>. One year after her only child's death despite three liver transplants, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> still is fighting. But public sentiment is no longer on her side, and her battle has moved into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s civil courts and attracted the attention of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legal authorities. `` I sit here with pictures all over the walls of my son. I sit here and I've lost him and I'm fighting for other people's kids and I'm being criticized,'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` To have people criticize me without knowing all the facts, it's very painful.'' With the first anniversary of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' death on Friday, falling coincidentally within National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, she said it hurts even more. `` April 29th is going to be a year and it has n't gotten any easier for me,'' she said. `` When I see kids playing, I get very emotional. Everything brings back memories. One thing I keep hearing over and over is <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> saying, ` Mommy, I love you with all my heart.''' The 32-year-old former public relations consultant, who is divorced from <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s father, has withheld $ 261,189 owed Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the world's leading liver transplant center. She alleges her son's third transplanted liver was defective and that a potential fourth liver was turned down the day he died. The hospital, which stands by its care of the boy, is suing Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> for the money. `` His treatment was beyond criticism. We still do n't succeed in all cases, although we do in the vast majority,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, director of transplant surgery at Children's and its affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian-University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't match the anguish a bereaved mother would have. But there's a very real pall of sadness that settles over us'' when a patient dies. The controversy surrounding <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s case `` only amplifies the scar'' and `` cheapens'' the boy's memory, <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. Hoping to spur a federal investigation of <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> last month released a series of internal memos in which anesthesiologists criticized the liver transplant program. The memos complained of poor communication among doctors, inadequate review of failed cases and general confusion. One memo cited a case in which two livers were `` switched about like peas under shells.'' A member of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s transplant oversight committee, an advisory group of two general physicians and six civic leaders, later explained the livers were swapped for medical reasons and that both operations succeeded. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, meanwhile, officials are investigating the way Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> handled the hundreds of thousands of dollars <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> received from countless Americans, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a fund that provided the initial $ 163,113 payment to the hospital. A state audit this year put the total amount Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> deposited in seven accounts at two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> banks at $ 980,310, a figure Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> says is far too high. The money poured in after $ 4,000 collected by <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s classmates was reported stolen in February 1987, a burglary still under investigation by <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police Even after arriving at Children's with her increasingly ill son, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> championed his cause like few parents before. On television shows and in frequent calls to reporters, she also stressed the need for organ donation and spoke out on behalf of others awaiting transplants. By the time <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died, the single bank account in his name had accumulated $ 509,913, according to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstein </PERSON>, chief of the economic crimes division in the Office of the State Attorney in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. As of mid-February, the balance was $ 239,288, he said. Those assets were frozen last month by a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge who appointed a curator for the estate. <PERSON> Kerstein </PERSON> says Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> spent at least $ 47,000 of the missing money on jewelry, clothes, furniture, a BMW automobile and a <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> apartment. He declined to break down that figure or elaborate on additional expenditures because of his office's investigation into possible fraud and other criminal violations Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> says she never squandered any of the donations and gave as much as $ 175,000 to families of transplant patients. She says she bought her 1984 BMW at an auction for $ 13,000 and her one-bedroom apartment doubles as her office, which she furnished with a computer and other equipment. The apartment rents for $ 850 a month, but she says her one-year lease includes three free months. Some of her own money was deposited with the donations, she says, and she used it to buy back jewelry she had pawned to pay medical bills. She says she also used some of the money to repay loans she took out to get <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` People do n't realize I was not an accountant and I was not an attorney and I did not have guidebooks,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is appealing a $ 1,000 fine for violating <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Solicitation of Charitable Contributions Act, which mandates that solicitations for single individuals go solely to the beneficiary She maintains she never asked for donations, but received them through sympathetic news accounts. Reacting to the furor, a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee approved a bill on April 20 to more strictly regulate charitable contributions. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has also been criticized for paying herself $ 300 a week as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ronnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeSillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was working 17 hours a day,'' she said in her defense. The doubts and bitterness raised by the DeSillers case have hardly been a boon to organ donation. `` It has made people even more suspicious of the transplant field in terms of fairness and equity, and I think therefore it has had a dangerous effect on the willingness of people to be organ donors,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. On the other hand, <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said, `` the case highlights the inadequacy of the way in which we fund innovation and progress in medical research. ... Families should n't need to beg for money or depend on charity.'' The DeSillers case has also made fund raising more difficult, according to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunde </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` It's sort of heart-breaking when you think about how this community -LRB- south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- responded to <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' needs.. and now it's having the opposite, negative impact,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lunde </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is chronicling her and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s struggle in a book she began writing four months ago. She says it includes `` everything that happened in the hospital: names, dates, circumstances.'' `` I know there's a reason for everything that happens and I know in the end, out of the ashes, comes the phoenix,'' she said. `` I know in the end, it will be for the good of other children that <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died.''

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>

 The scenery is magnificent: the snow-capped <LOCATION> Elburz </LOCATION> mountains rising majestically outside the capital. But cynical residents say the credit for that belongs to <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has been at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since 1980. In normal times, the <LOCATION> Elburz </LOCATION> mountains are often obscured by a curtain of smog. But since the `` Missile War of the Cities'' prompted a mass exodus from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, pollution has radically declined. `` <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> could become minister of the environment'' was the ironic comment of an Iranian interpreter who accompanied a Western press group on a recent visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. About half of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 6 million perople _ by private estimates 8 million plus _ are believed to have left the city after it became the target of long-range Iraqi missiles. Many who stayed are frightened. In the hope that reinforced concrete will offer protection against the missiles, the wealthy have packed the major hotels, paying a room rate of 6,100 rials a night. That is $ 91.50 at the official exchange rate and is more than one tenth of a worker's average monthly salary Some low-income families have moved into improvised air raid shelters, often underground parking lots, taking along carpets and other personal belongings. Anyone who loots an empty apartment faces an ancient punishment _ the right hand is cut off. The Iraqi missile attacks have already claimed more than 1,000 civilian lives in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, chiefly in the poorer quarters. Fears of a further escalation have mounted since <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s gas attack at <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, a Kurdish town in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, after it was captured in an Iranian offensive in March. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims that 5,000 civilians were killed and 7,000 injured in the attack. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recently acknowledged for the first time that it has been using chemical weapons barred by 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocols. Its claim that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is also using them has been emphatically denied by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and diplomatic sources here say they have no reason to question that denial. How long will the war continue? <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it will accept a cease-fire only if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is formally identified as the aggressor by the international community and is punished. It demands the ouster of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s president and several hundred billion dollars in reparations An Iranian businessman who spent several years in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> said most people are tired of the war but generally fail to understand why the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can not rule it was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that started it. `` That would be the first step to a solution,'' he said. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refuses to accept the blame, and the matter remains in dispute. `` We will fight until final victory,'' a crowd chanted during one recent Friday prayer service on the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with a population estimated at 46.6 million, three times that of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, has an inferior arsenal and airpower. It has already paid a heavy toll. By the end of 1986, the number of dead or wounded was estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at 750,000. It said the actual figure may be much higher. The economic costs of the war are staggering, chiefly because <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air attacks have slashed oil revenues and refinery capacities. In 1986, according to the local press, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had to spend $ 1.5 billion of scarce foreign exchange to pay for imports that otherwise would have been covered by oil exports. This was more than twice the total of revenues from non-oil exports, led by Persian rugs. Coping with runaway inflation has become a daily chore for the average Iranian. Basic food is rationed and most is still relatively inexpensive. The price of a kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- of bread is the rial equivalent of 60 cents at the official conversion rate, but a kilogram of rationed meat is $ 10.50. A worker making the equivalent of $ 600 a month has to moonlight to support a family. The prices of non-essential items are soaring. They range from $ 330 for a toy F-14 Tomcat fighter plane made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> _ with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military markings _ and $ 360 for a pair of Turkish-made blue jeans to $ 19,500 for a 13-year-old Paykan car, with a British-made Hillman engine and an unspecified number of miles on it. Quite a few Iranians apparently can still easily afford such prices and even greater luxuries, however.

<HEAD>TEHRAN: luxuries, however.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Private wealth has been widely left untouched by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic revolution and free enterprise is encouraged by the Koran, the Islamic holy book. The black market has become so much a part of the economy that the `` free'' exchange rates are regularly quoted by the national news agency, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. And although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the `` Great Satan,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar is the preferred currency and at the free-exchange rate one dollar fetches 1,165 rials, 17 times the official rate. `` I know of a woman who still flies to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> every spring to buy a new collection of clothes, spending perhaps $ 15,000 or more,'' said one European resident at a dinner party replete with whiskey, rock music and dancing _ all forbidden _ in <LOCATION> Shemiram </LOCATION>, the elegant section in northern <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Shemiram has been spared by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles so far. But even there, some villas and apartments are empty because their owners have fled to <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resorts or the <LOCATION> Elburz </LOCATION> mountains, where Islamic rules require men and women to ski on separate trails. The Shemiram section also includes the residence of the 86-year-old <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who looks in relatively good shape, according to diplomats who recently saw him at his mosque. Growing popular discontent with the unequal sharing of the war's financial burdens may have been at a root of his recent Fatwa, or binding religious guideline, that strengthened the hands of the government Up to now, key economic reforms have been blocked on religious grounds by the Council for the Protection of the Constitution, a watchdog body dominated by Islamic fundamentalists. Tax collection has been sluggish. Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Majedi </PERSON> said recently taxation capacity was twice that currently collected. A Western diplomat termed his estimate a gross understatement. `` God knows that even the filthy capitalist system in the West is not like that,'' a legislator, <PERSON> Sahed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahaili </PERSON>, recently complained in the Majlis, the 270-seat parliament. He was referring to a huge tax debt run up by one of the various foundations controlled by religious authorities. `` When someone moves to another state in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, all his records are checked to make sure he has paid all his taxes,'' the legislator added. The new parliament formed after the April 8 general elections is widely predicted to step up pressure for reforms, with the position of its pragmatist speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, strengthened further. Reformers may face an uphill battle. Official figures cited by the newspaper Etela'at suggest that black market trends are determined by speculative money worth tens of billions of dollars. There is little doubt, however, that the role of the mullahs, the religious dignitaries, will be reduced by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Fatwa. The Fatwa says the government may even prevent <PERSON> Hadj </PERSON>, the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, if the national interests demand a temporary suspension. Iranians already have noticed a certain relaxation in the enforcement of religious laws. Women wearing make-up or nail polish or who let part of their hair peek out from under a headdress are normally no longer stopped on the street by the Pasdaran, the revolutionary guards. But the chador, the all-encompassing outer garment, remains a must for women, even when skiing. `` When they come downhill, they look like bats,'' said the wife of a European ambassador.

<HEAD>Exhibit of Ancient Egypt's Last Great Pharaoh To Open In Boston</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Generations of workers and slaves transported granite blocks 600 miles down the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to erect the 57-ton Colossus of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. Nearly 3,200 years later, sophisticated engineers at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Museum of Science were perplexed about how they would handle the giant statue honoring <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the last great Pharaoh of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the empire's most prolific builder While preparing for an exhibit of artifacts from his 66-year reign, engineers grappled with methods to bring the 27-foot structure into the museum. Proposals to demolish a wall or cut a hole in the roof were deemed infeasible and too costly. `` So we decided to put it outside,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dussault </PERSON>, a project coordinator for the `` Ramesses the Great'' exhibit, which opens April 30 and runs for four months. `` I have to say it looks pretty majestic.'' Exhibit directors use the preferred translation of the Pharaoh's name _ Ramesses _ instead of the more accepted anglicized version, <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> The giant statue depicts Ramses wearing the cone-shaped crown of upper <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> royalty and a pleated skirt. Jewels adorn his neck and wrist, as he strides forward, left foot first. The colossus was uncovered by crews digging the foundation for a building in 1962 near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. It was broken into three large pieces and many fragments. About 30 workers began to reassemble the statue in 1985, doing the reconstruction in the area where it had been discovered. The Colossus of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> will stand outside the museum, encased in a 40-foot wood and steel structure resembling an ancient Egyptian temple. The monument is the centerpiece of the 72-piece exhibit, the largest collection of antiquities from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Golden Age ever on display in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Ramses show is larger than the 55 artifacts seen by more than 8 million people in the Tutankhanum exhibit, which toured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in the late 1970s and generated more than $ 50 million. Priceless antiquities from the reign of Ramses the Great were first seen in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in October 1985 at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. That show went on to be displayed at the World's Fair in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON>. The three sections of the colossus and dozens of crates containing other artifacts from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s Egyptian Museum arrived in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> last week from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The exhibit, insured by <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for $ 40 million, was designed to depict the grandeur as well as the simplicity of life under <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>. Ornate jewelry, including a 19-pound gold necklace with braided collar and 14 tassels, are displayed along with such prosaic items as a cosmetic case, a bronze razor and senet, a board game popular at the time. There's also the lid from the mummy coffin that contained <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' remains; the elaborate burial chamber of <LOCATION> Sannedjem </LOCATION>, a respected painter and artisan; and several statues of baboons from the temple at <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Simbel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> left a rich legacy of monuments and buildings, including his mortuary temple at <LOCATION> Thebes </LOCATION>, the temple of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Simbel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Nubia </LOCATION>, two obelisks in front of the Temple at <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>, his palace city at <LOCATION> Zoan </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Karnak </LOCATION> with the largest columns in the world _ they measure roughly 11 feet in diameter. Architects still marvel at the precision of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simbel </LOCATION>, where sunlight streams 160 feet into the temple on certain days to illuminate an inner chamber. <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>, reported to have sired 90 children, waged a long and successful battle against the Hittites of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and is believed by some biblical scholars to be the Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus. Like his prodigious family and his mammoth projects, tales of his life ring on a grand scale. Ancient records say <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> claimed his birth was signaled by the emergence of the star <ORGANIZATION> Sirius </ORGANIZATION> on the same day as Egyptians' began their religious and civil new years, a convergence which occurs once every 1,461 years. He ruled from 1279-1213 B.C. No one is quite sure when he was born, but he was in his 80s when he died. <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, his grandfather who founded the 19th dynasty after Akhnaton and <PERSON> Tutankhamen </PERSON>, ruled for one year. Seti I, <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' father, waged war against Libyans and <PERSON> Hittites </PERSON> and extended the boundaries of the Egyptian empire. <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> continued war against the <ORGANIZATION> Hittites </ORGANIZATION> _ an ancient people of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The Battle of <LOCATION> Kadesh </LOCATION> was one of the last battles with the <ORGANIZATION> Hittites </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> later signed a peace treaty with the <ORGANIZATION> Hittites </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' mummy remains in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> exhibit will feature Padihershef, a 2,500-year-old mummy owned by <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>.

 This town is <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a new community fashioned from an old <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of front porches and back yard paths, picket fences and brick streets, good neighbors and easy sociability. This town is also a different town: those porches and fences are mandated, and lawns, artificial siding and attached garages are forbidden. Seaside, pop. 203, is a small resort with a big ambition _ to revive a style of civic intimacy out of fashion since <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> moved to the suburbs. By bringing homes, offices, stores and play areas closer together, Seaside's tight grid of streets, paths and squares is designed to get people out of their cars and in touch. If this sounds familiar, it is. `` The newest idea in planning is the 19th century town,'' says architect <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Duany </PERSON>, whose firm designed Seaside's master plan and wrote its building code. `` Seaside is the only authentic American town to be built in the last 40 years.'' It's also one of the most celebrated. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, part of the pack of critics, designers and developers who have made the pilgrimage to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle, calls Seaside `` perhaps the most important new piece of architecture in the country.'' `` Seaside has no enemies,'' gloats <PERSON> Duany </PERSON>. `` It's the old American way of doing things.'' And he says that because the town plan and building code can be adjusted for any town, `` it's going to be the model for the new suburb.'' At the moment, however, Seaside is at least a decade from completion. Less than a third of its 300 planned houses have been built, and the spaces set aside for a school, church, inn and meeting hall are empty. The town square is a muddy lot. Because it has few year-round residents, Seaside is virtually deserted in winter. Although Seaside is designed to limit dependence on the automobile, there is little within walking distance besides a restaurant, a snack bar, a book store, a boutique and a one-room post office that houses the five-shelf public library. What has been built is charming: the pastel wooden cottages range in style from neo-Victorian to plain old <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cracker, but feel like parts of a whole; the skyline is enlivened by towers, widow's walks and pitched roofs, all encouraged by the code; the landscaping _ indigenous sand and scrub _ is natural. There are many nice details, such as a trellis-shaded chess board, a gazebo in an intersection, a balcony over the front door of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> shed. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> footpaths offer shortcuts between back yards. Houses bear signs with residents' names, instead of numbers This is how <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> dreamed it would be. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a 44-year-old <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, native, had visited this area as a boy, building castles in the white sand along the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In 1978, when he inherited 80 acres here, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> wanted to build again. But he was revolted by the cold condominium towers sprouting along the water. He drove around the Southeast, visiting gracious old towns. Equipped with tape measure, notebook and camera, he recorded street widths, building dimensions, architectural types. The result is Seaside. `` This is not an artistic endeavor,'' says <PERSON> Duany </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on some of the trips. `` What we've done has nothing to do with inspiration. We know how to design because we've studied cities and towns that work. American town planning and design traditions `` seem so dumb and simple,'' marvels <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Why would we ever have gotten away from them?'' Cheap cars, cheap gas and cheap land allowed those who engineered the post-World War II building boom to separate home, market and workplace as never before. Lessons learned by previous generations _ such as the proper ratio of a street's width to the height of its buildings, or how far an adult with a child will walk to a store _ seemed irrelevant. <PERSON> Duany </PERSON> complains that today's suburbanites must drive to buy a loaf of bread, play tennis, visit a friend, `` even to walk the dog.'' If they do step out front, their wide, meandering streets, many without sidewalks, afford an inhospitable meeting place. As a result, few residents stop to discuss the weather, drink coffee, gossip. If people do not talk, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duany </PERSON> believe, culture can not flourish. In its master plan and building code, Seaside looks to a more amiable past; it seeks not only to look like an old town, but to work like one.

<HEAD>SEASIDE: like one.</HEAD>

 Like a traditional Southern town, Seaside's design includes commercial buildings with sidewalk arcades and offices and apartments on the upper floors; on-street parking, but only one small parking lot; and straight, tree-lined boulevards that connect public places. Houses are required to have a front porch 16 feet from the street, to encourage conversation between porch sitters and pedestrians. Each front yard must have a fence, and it must be different from the others on the street. Garages must be in back, out of sight. The lines of fences and houses produce intimate, visually stimulating streets that feel like outdoor rooms. `` Human beings are programmed to feel space,'' <PERSON> Duany </PERSON> says. `` In the wrong kind of space, you feel, ` What am I doing here?''' `` Look at <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>,'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` People pay incredible prices for substandard plumbing, small rooms and parking three blocks away _ just to live on a nice street.'' When the weather is good, Seaside's residents stroll around, looking at new houses, chatting and generally enjoying themselves. Motorists do n't speed because the streets are narrow, slightly bumpy, lined with parked cars and filled with pedestrians. `` You ca n't help but meet people,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Koronkiewicz </PERSON>, an accountant from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> whose family vacations at Seaside. `` It brings out the best in you.'' The ultimate evidence of Seaside's success is financial. The cost of an typical 50-by-100-foot lot has risen from $ 20,000 six years ago to around $ 70,000 today _ twice as much as a lot the same size elsewhere along the coast. But Seaside is not perfect. In the heat of summer, for instance, most residents seem to prefer the comfort of an air-conditioned living room to the more social climate on the porch. And back yard cottages and upstairs apartments, forbidden in most new communities but encouraged by Seaside's building code, have become too expensive for the kinds of people supposed to live in them, such as domestics and students. This lack of a socio-economic mix, says <PERSON> Duany </PERSON>, is `` the one signal failure of Seaside. It's a rich person's town.'' That leads some to wonder if this seasonal, affluent resort _ still more theory than reality _ is an appropriate model for the new American suburb. <PERSON> Duany </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> have no doubt that Seaside, or at least its master plan and building code, can be transplanted. Even large communities should be broken down into small village clusters, they say. `` We're preaching to developers and architects that the same elements that go into suburbs can be reformulated into fairly dense little towns,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Duany </PERSON> and his wife and partner, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Plater-Zyberk </PERSON>, have fashioned a model ordinance designed to create a Seaside-like `` Traditional Neighborhood District'' wherever it is adopted. `` We just mail it out,'' he says. `` If you want to make an impact in this country, you have to kick into mass production.'' But Americans seem to love the privacy and comfort of their cars and suburbs. Given what <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> calls `` a national distrust of urban life and communal living,'' do they really want to get closer to each other? `` After generations of increasing privatization, Americans are starved for public life,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> insists. `` When you step outside your house you want to see people. It's scary for our culture that we've stopped seeing each other on the street.''

 For 20 years <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> has talked architecture, taught architecture, delineated architecture, designed architecture. Everything but built architecture. `` I do not build because I am an architect,'' he once wrote, meaning he would not compromise his principles and build in a world being rendered uninhabitable by industrialization, technology and modern architecture. When his plan for a school in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> came in 200 percent over budget, <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> gave up the commission rather than change his design. But now this consummate purist is building _ a wood cottage for vacation time in this new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle resort. `` He finally took a deep breath and plunged into the abyss,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, Seaside's developer. `` I'm honored he's willing to make an exception for Seaside.'' `` Seaside comes along at just the right moment,'' <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> native, said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` There's nothing new like it.'' As far as <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> is concerned, all the problems of architecture were solved before the Industrial Revolution; modern architecture and technology have served mainly to ruin the world's cities. Seaside, on the other hand, reflects his preference for small settlements, human scale, pedestrian activity and traditional buildings. Although <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> has no track record, `` his plans have been influential far beyond their unexecuted state for the way in which they have re-established a lost vision'' of a romantic past, according to architectural critic <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Huxtable </PERSON>. <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> also is a bit of a gadfly. At an architects' conference three years ago, <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> pointedly questioned <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, dean of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> architects, about a skyscraper he'd designed in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The building, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> admitted, was `` 2 million square feet of space that should not be in this part of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' Implicitly acknowledging <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>'s purity, he added, `` I am a whore and I am paid very well for high-rise buildings.'' In return for helping to lay out Seaside's plan and design the town tower, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> a building lot. But he attached one condition: <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> had to build on it. The three-room cottage, designed to resemble a classical temple, should be ready this summer. <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> wants to see how it turns out before completing his design for the tower. After years of designing on paper, he joked, `` I want to see how many mistakes I've made.''

 Maturing baby boomers are changing the rules for menswear as they look for clothes somewhere between jeans and T-shirt and the pinstripe suit. `` Most of the younger guys who are working grew up on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> and rock' n' roll,'' said award-winning designer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, whose label is starting its third year. This generation, he says, is `` breaking down barriers of how and where you wear things.'' The experimentation is evident in clothes now being shown for fall, soon to be sent to stores across the country. The look includes round, softer shoulders on sportcoats; high-waisted sweaters meant to be tucked in; mock turtlenecks to be worn under vests; buttery `` antique leathers'' and suedes. Browns, grays and blacks are popular, but some designers are throwing in reds, yellows and what one called `` vegetable colors.'' `` I think men are ready to wear color,'' said <PERSON> Ronaldus </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamask </PERSON>, a relative newcomer to menswear whose minimalistic designs in such shades as mustard, teal and wine have won acclaim. `` Men are becoming much more comfortable with experimenting.'' The classic Polo line by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, who's been designing menswear for more than 20 years, is trying out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Indian styles, suede shirts and `` antique ski and expedition clothing.'' Even the business suit is `` loosening up,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Julian </PERSON>, associate fashion director of the Men's <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Men are more aware -LRB- of fashion -RRB- today.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschlag </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Men </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportswear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buyers </ORGANIZATION>, says suits are appearing in a variety of silhouettes this fall and even the double-breasted suit will attempt a comeback. Men are moving away from the investment-dressing era and into a stage of experimentation, <PERSON> Herschlag </PERSON> says. He and others in the field attribute the development partly to the influence of movies and TV shows like `` thirtysomething'' and `` L.A. Law'' that feature smartly dressed young professionals. Business is helped when men see role models like <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> `` looking groovy'' on TV, says <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who describes his clothes as souped-up versions of American classics. `` It's not silly; it's not meant to make a statement,'' insisted <PERSON> Shamask </PERSON>'s sales director, <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON>. `` It's more for people who are tired of playing games. It's more: ` This is me.''' That's not to say the new looks are for everyone. Those who are sticking with jeans should know that this fall marks the beginning of the `` post-acidwashed era,'' <PERSON> Herschlag </PERSON> said. `` The pendulum is swinging back to very, very dark colors,'' said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON>. And the conservative business suit is not dead yet. `` There'll always be a <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> element in the society,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said.

Bond prices fell and the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond rose to 9.05 percent, although prices later recovered somewhat. Stocks also fell Wednesday, pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average down 14.09 points to 1,985.41, its third straight decline. The financial markets first were jolted last week when an unexpectedly high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for February sent the dollar plunging. A government report that wholesale prices jumped in March intensified investor worries. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which is counting on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to keep the economy growing through the November election, contended Wednesday that the inflation fears were overblown. `` Despite large increases for consumer and producer prices in March, the smaller increases in prices in previous months ... indicate that inflation remains under control,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Some private economists disputed that view. `` The CPI rise reflects an increasingly widespread inflationary environment,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The good news on inflation is over for this year and the question now really is ` how high will prices go?''' The March CPI increase followed a modest 0.2 percent February rise and was the biggest monthly gain since a 0.7 percent increase in January 1987. In another economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings, after discounting for inflation, fell 0.3 percent in March, the second consecutive monthly decline The changes left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 1.2 percent below a year ago.

 Profit-taking and quiet days in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> following Monday's combat have helped sustain a slide in oil futures prices. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled at $ 17.74 per barrel on Wednesday, down 29 cents from Tuesday, when they fell 49 cents.

<HEAD>Japan's Economy Booming, Surprising Economists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy is riding one of its biggest booms of the past five years, surprising many economists who just last year were predicting a recession. Economists say the boom _ fueled by low interest rates, tax cuts and massive public spending _ will continue for at least two years. Further into the future, they say, annual growth in the gross national product likely will exceed the government's 3.75 percent forecast for the next five years. `` The speed of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s recovery has surprised most commentators. This is really a remarkable pace,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerran </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> investment firm. `` The domestic economy is roaring.'' During the past 11 months, manufacturing output shot up 14 percent, a figure that took twice as long to achieve during the boom years of the 1970s, economists say. Government officials report that corporate profits rose 27.2 percent during 1987, while household savings rose by 11.8 percent. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose a near record 5.8 percent in February alone, second only to a 5.9 percent rise recorded in November 1975. According to the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, sustaining the current economic pace over the rest of 1988 would mean gross national product growth of 5 percent, corporate profit growth of about 18 percent and retail sales growth of 13.8 percent. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1987 growth alone could keep the economic boom rolling for the rest of this year _ making it a fertile market for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations wanting to boost their exports. A drop in Japanese exports because of the rising yen _ which makes Japanese products more expensive overseas _ cooled the economy somewhat last year, but exports affect only 17 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s GNP, <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said. `` The other 83 percent is not exports, and that did very well,'' he said. <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said the current boom is the best of the past four or five years, although the officially projected GNP growth rate of 3.75 percent is low compared to the 8 percent to 10 percent a year <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> achieved during the 1960s and part of the 1970s. Just last May, economists were saying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was headed for an economic downturn, with the yen's rapid rise inflating prices for the nation's export-driven economy. Industrial production fell to its lowest rate in years, and unemployment rose to a record 3.2 percent. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate is artificially low, because it counts as employed members of the armed forces and people who work more than one hour during the last week of the month. `` There was a lot of pressure to stop the yen from going up'' in 1986, <PERSON> Jerran </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> achieved this by cutting interest rates, fueling a domestic housing boom that contributed about one-third of the GNP growth.'' <PERSON> Jerran </PERSON> said the government also injected $ 48 billion into the economy through public works spending and tax cuts. At a news conference on Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said he was pleased with the economy's performance and said one of his biggest concerns is maintaining stability. <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said that without a sudden appreciation in the yen or a rapid rise in prices, economic growth was unlikely to slow. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will benefit somewhat from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prosperity, <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said the effect would not be that great Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports rose by 55.8 percent last month from a year earlier, exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> still accounted for less than 1 percent of gross national product. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to export not only to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but everywhere else to get out of the problems it is in now,'' he said. One downside to the Japanese economy might be in housing starts and the relative prosperity <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has enjoyed for the past year: things have been so good, economists say, there is bound to be a slowdown. The cost of housing has reached the point where it takes eight years of a worker's gross income to purchase a small condominium, which costs about $ 500,000. Four years is considered normal in most other countries. <PERSON> Jerran </PERSON> also says there is a danger of the Japanese economy overheating. `` Because of the rapid rise over the past year, industry is running out of capacity and labor,'' he said. `` This raises the danger that prices will climb upwards.'' In turn, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> may decide to push interest rates higher _ possibly by this summer _ to help curb inflation, he said.

<HEAD>Aeromexico Strike and Bankruptcy Raises Tourism Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prospects for a banner year in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s crucial tourism industry may have been grounded by the bankruptcy of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> airline A federal judge declared <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> bankrupt on Monday and ordered it into receivership, leaving its more than 9,200 workers jobless. The airline already had canceled most of its flights because of a strike triggered by <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for a cost-cutting restructuring. `` The disappearance of <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> will affect negatively the tourism sector and will hinder -LRB- it -RRB- from reaching the estimates of transportation of foreign visitors to the different national destinations,'' Tourism Secretary <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Savignac </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday night. Tourism vies with the `` maquiladora'' assembly plant industry _ in which foreign companies set up factories in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to take advantage of cheap labor _ _ as the nation's No. 2 source of foreign exchange after petroleum. Estimates had been that tourism would bring in as much as $ 2.4 billion this year, the highest since 1982, when the peso's drop in value against the dollar started a slide in tourism revenue. <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy after ground and technical workers went on strike April 12 in protest of management plans to reduce the fleet and route system to bring the money-losing airline into the black. <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Savignac </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mexicana </PERSON>, the other state-run airline which is unaffected by the bankruptcy or strike, carry 57 percent of the foreign tourists arriving by air. <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> was the only carrier serving 15 Mexican cities. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 7,250 striking workers, announced plans to seek a meeting with President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. `` We will ask the president for a restructuring of the company,'' <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejorada </PERSON>, the union's secretary for internal matters, said in a phone interview. He said the union still had not received formal notification of the judge's bankruptcy decision, which had been announced by the federal Communications and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The airline's 2,000 pilots and cabin attendants have their own unions that did not support the strike, which forced cancellation of all 223 daily flights to 42 domestic and international destinations. The union has charged that the decision to seek bankruptcy was politically motivated and not made on economic grounds. No plans have been announced for a replacement for <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION>. Mexicana on Tuesday started accepting <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> tickets for routes in which they operated with parallel service. <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> started business in 1934 and has been owned by the government since 1957. Mexicana has been controlled by the government since 1982.

<HEAD>Imprisoned Wall Street Felon's Lawyers Seek Reduced Sentence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s help in exposing other Wall Street felons is more significant than previously recognized and could spark new indictments by fall, his lawyers have indicated in a request to cut the convicted speculator's prison sentence. In seeking to reduce the three-year term, lawyers <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> also disclosed that federal officials physically protected <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> from a death threat before he began serving his sentence last month. They also claim <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has been tailed and harassed by others _ sometimes using telephone-equipped cars _ he has implicated in financial felonies. `` Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has been asked, and has volunteered, information about topics, people, relationships, transactions and securities that were not the subject of pre-sentence debriefing sessions,'' the document states. `` He has suggested new avenues of inquiry for government investigators.'' The document, filed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> last Friday and made available by his office Wednesday, marked one of the clearest public indications yet that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s disclosures will mean a broad range of new indictments. It also provided new insight on the extent of his cooperation. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s lawyers did not suggest how much the sentence should be reduced. They also asked <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> not to consider the request until about October, claiming by then `` the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation will become even more evident than it was at sentencing, or than it can be now.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney handling the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> case, would not comment on the request or other aspects of the document. But he said the government intended to file a written response with <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> by Friday. Once Wall Street's best-known speculator in stocks of companies targeted for possible takeovers, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> stunned the financial world in November 1986 when he paid the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million to settle charges he illegally used secret insider information to profit in securities deals. He was banished from the securities business for life. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has since cooperated in a massive federal probe that has resulted in four criminal charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, seven in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, four guilty pleas and nine civil actions by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. In return, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was allowed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. He was sentenced to three years in federal prison by <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> on Dec. 18 and began serving it March 23. Five days after sentencing, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was back in debriefing sessions with federal prosecutors, his lawyers said in the document filed with <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>. In addition, the document said he has attended more than a dozen other meetings since then with agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. It also said the sessions covered `` new topics, new transactions, new relationships, and new securities growing out of Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s earlier cooperation and other governmental investigations.'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> also helped investigators in analyzing hundreds of documents involved in its criminal and civil investigations, the plea contended. His lawyers said <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> cooperated despite a death threat from former friend and fellow speculator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>, who was arrested Feb. 18 with a loaded assault rifle, two pistols and a shotgun after making death threats. Federal prosecutors have since said that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> implicated <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> in illegal conduct. In a previously undisclosed detail, his lawyers said federal officials `` took a number of public and private steps to protect Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s safety.'' They also said <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>'s death threat came `` at a time when other subjects of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s Boesky-related investigations had Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> under physical surveillance.'' They said those people, who were n't identified, hired agents who `` watched Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s movements from telephone-equipped cars, followed him on the streets, questioned other patrons at establishments he utilized and harassed him in various other ways.''

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Lifts No-Smoking Assignment From Ad Agency</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is putting another advertising agency in charge of creating commercials for its smoke-free flights to relieve tobacco industry pressures on the agency that created the first ads for its program. <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compton </ORGANIZATION>, a huge New York-based agency, created the first ads for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s no-smoking program and remains the airline's agency for other general advertising. The commercials showed passengers applauding <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to ban smoking on nearly all its domestic flights. Shortly after the ads started airing last month, <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> was fired from its longtime job making cookie and candy ads for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also makes cigarettes. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was moving the no-smoking program assignment to the <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON> agency, based in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The agency already handles <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s ads in media aimed at the travel trade. The job involves about $ 2 million of the estimated $ 50 million in Northwest billings handled by <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> had cited `` philosophical differences'' for pulling its cookie and candy assignments from <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION>, but those familiar with the decision said privately that <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> executives were troubled <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> had created the no-smoking ads and failed to tell them about it. `` We are extremely disappointed that a reactionary faction of the tobacco industry continues to put literally dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> professional careers in jeopardy,'' A.B. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON>, executive vice president for marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said in explaining why it moved the no-smoking assignment to another agency. He said that while the <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, Minn.-based airline was happy with <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s work, it wanted to make sure that <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> `` can continue to serve us with total objectivity and enthusiasm.'' <PERSON> Magary </PERSON> declined in an interview to be more specific about what pressures <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> was under from the tobacco industry, but said the airline had been told the agency continued to feel pressured. <PERSON> Magary </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> offered to reassign the no-smoking job to another agency `` in hopes of solving their problem and they accepted our offer to do it.'' He said it was up to the agency to elaborate on whatever pressures they feel they continue to be under. But agency spokesmen declined the opportunity to do so. `` We understand <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s decision with regard to the no-smoking assignment,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeshan </PERSON>, executive vice president and management director in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> account at <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION>. But he declined to say whether <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> supported or solicited the action, adding only that, `` We are anxious to put this matter behind us.'' <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> also is the advertising agency for <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s True cigarettes. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, said the cigarette company was not putting any pressure on <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> no-smoking ads.

 Newly elected Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has a `` new sense of urgency'' and is committed to sustaining its strong first-quarter profit increases. `` No officer of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is feeling content and complacent,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told shareholders Wednesday at the company's annual meeting. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 53, was elevated to chairman and chief executive by the board of directors late Tuesday, a day after the death from colon cancer of his 62-year-old predecessor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. Also on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T announced a 10.6 percent increase in its first quarter earnings. Its earnings per share rose 15 percent because of a redemption of preferred shares that lessened the amount that had to be skimmed off for preferred dividends. Asked at a news conference whether <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could keep up the 15 percent growth in earnings per share for the rest of 1988, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said: `` That's our firm commitment.'' At the meeting, shareholders rejected a white supremacist group's resolution that sought to phase out <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's affirmative action but also rejected a proposal to expand affirmative action. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who was president and chief operating officer, is a thoughtful, soft-spoken contrast to the forceful <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. But the two men were close and <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> had groomed him as a successor. `` This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told shareholders with a slight quaver in his voice. `` I sincerely wish it were under different circumstances.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> tackled questions about whether he had the steel to continue <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s legacy. He said he was proud of his style of developing trusting relations with colleagues. `` First and foremost, I'm a team player,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told reporters. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to $ 492 million, or 46 cents a share, from $ 445 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.8 percent to $ 8.35 billion from $ 8.12 billion. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's earnings statement indicated continuing difficulties in selling computers and office equipment. Revenue was flat in the category of data products, network equipment and business communications products. In contrast, revenue from services, mainly long-distance, was up 8.2 percent. While noting that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T had done a good job of cutting costs, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the company must work harder on increasing sales. `` No business can live by cost control alone. It must grow,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Rawleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, the retired chief of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> director, told shareholders that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> spoke with him by phone two weeks ago and said that `` should anything happen to him, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was his natural successor.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> had served as president and chief operating officer since 1986. Before that he had held top finance jobs in the company and had a long career in the Bell telephone companies. The resolution against affirmative action was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a white supremacist organization based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Poinsett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, spoke on its behalf, contending that blacks are less intelligent and affirmative action hurts the morale of whites The resolution earned votes of 8.6 percent of the shares. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T considered the proposal `` highly objectionable'' and tried three times to get the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to keep it off the ballot. The resolution calling for more affirmative action was introduced by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, a black manager at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T says a white supremacist group hurt employee morale with its proposal to phase out affirmative action, even though the proposal fell far short of victory. The resolution by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> _ which contended that minorities were intellectually inferior to whites _ drew 8.6 percent of shares voted at Wednesday's annual meeting of shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. It might have won fewer votes if shareholders had realized the negative impact it had on the morale of the company's `` family of employees,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlingame </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for human resources. An opposing resolution to increase affirmative action, proposed by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, a black manager at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, won just 6 percent of the shares voted.

<HEAD>Federal Regulators Plan Texas Thrift Industry Revamping</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plan to clean up the state's troubled savings and loan institutions has gotten an overwhelming response from thrifts ready to participate, according to a spokesman for federal regulators. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said Wednesday it would announce later this month the first consolidations in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts. The <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> announced the program in February and requested proposals from interested parties by March 31. `` We have received about 150 proposals from parties interested in participating in the Southwest Plan,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` This is an overwhelming response of parties interested in the plan.'' Of 279 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts, 104 were insolvent as of Sept. 30, 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION>. Those endangered institutions will be consolidated, closed or sold, said <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON>. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> chairman, has said that roughly half the problems of the nation's thrift industry are in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has been hit hard by an energy and real estate slump in recent years. Investors would provide up to $ 1 billion in capital for the plan. Much of the expense will be paid by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was expected to provide $ 7 billion at first and up to $ 2 billion annually. `` We believe, overall, we need a fair and equitable analysis for each proposal,'' <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON> said. `` That analysis must balance the interests of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> and private investors. We anticipate the first consolidations to be available in late April.'' Colgren would not say how many S & amp; Ls would be involved in the first announcement but added that `` a geometric progression of consolidations'' would be made thereafter. Industry officials had said earlier that the state's thrift crisis increases with every delay, along with the cost of remedies. But <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON> said: `` We will not rush into any deal that is bad for <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> and bad for the industry. We do not want to create more problems. Otherwise, today's solutions become tomorrow's problems.'' On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> officials reported that the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s insurance fund shortfall almost doubled in 1987 to an estimated $ 11.6 billion. `` We anticipate the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION> to cost <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> somewhere between $ 6 and 7 billion,'' said <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON>. `` Through <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> recapitalization signed by the president in August of last year, we will raise $ 10.8 billion over the next three years ...'' `` Through <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> notes, and other sources, we anticipate having about $ 20 billion to work with,'' he said. Insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts will have lost at least $ 895 million in operating expenses in the first four months of this year, according to one analysis. `` We believe through consolidation of the industry through the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, interest from private investors, reducing the cost of funds that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions must pay to attract deposits _ the ` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> premium' _ and using <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> sources, we can solve the problems in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>UAW Wants Japanese-Style Pay For Japanese-Style Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> would consider <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to adopt corporate-wide Japanese-style production methods if its executives accept a less lucrative Japanese-style pay system, a union official says. Workers and union officials joined <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> on Wednesday in sharply criticizing the multimillion-dollar wages received by top <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executives, particularly Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, as the union and No. 3 automaker continued talks over a new labor contract. `` What we're wanting is what's fair and equitable for all of our members in relation to the standing of the corporation,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1413 in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` When we hear the type money these guys are making, then that indicates the standings of the corporation.'' Negotiations entered their fourth day today over a contract to replace the one expiring Sept. 14. The pact would cover 66,000 active and laid off workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, the union's chief negotiator, targeted <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> the day after <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> disclosed the chairman received $ 17.9 million in 1987 in salary, cash and stock bonuses and money earned exercising stock options. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> in 1987 was the highest-paid auto company executive for a second straight year. In 1986, when he earned $ 20.6 million, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also was the nation's highest-paid executive. `` Executive compensations have gotten completely out of hand,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. `` It makes it extremely difficult for us to sit down in a rational manner and try to negotiate a decent contract.'' Word of <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s pay prompted calls from workers demanding that union officials seek higher pay or other benefits in their contract, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. Under the Japanese system cited by <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, managers earn six to eight times more than workers. American managers earn about 18 times more and, in <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s case, 27 times more, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers earn $ 14.43 an hour including cost-of-living adjustments, or gross base pay of about $ 30,000. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> also said that before Japanese workers are laid off or their pay is cut, Japanese managers take a pay cut. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> raised the pay comparisons a day after <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s chief negotiator, said the automaker has asked union leaders to support its efforts to adopt so-called Modern Operating Agreements at all plants. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s Local 1413 is one of six plants where MOAs are in effect. The Japanese-style MOA production system organizes workers into teams, uses them in a variety of jobs instead of a single defined task and reduces the number of workers needed to cover for absentees, inspect products and correct mistakes. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> also asked for a committee comprising union, company and outside representatives to study the effectiveness of job security provisions in the new contract. The committee also would look at ways to increase productivity and improve quality, another weapon in the push for MOA adoption. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the union would consider that proposal if the committee also could study and adjust top executives' compensation to bring it into line with the Japanese managers-to-workers pay ratio. `` We think it is only fair that since they ask us to go to a Japanese production system such as MOAs and team concept ... it is fair for them to go to the Japanese system in terms of compensation,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said.

 The founders of the <LOCATION> Banana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> chain of `` adventure clothing'' stores have resigned from the company because of differences with its owner, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, who founded <LOCATION> Banana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1978 and sold it to The Gap five years later, announced Wednesday they were leaving because of `` fundamental creative and cultural differences'' with Gap management The company also announced it was discontinuing `` Trips'' magazine, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s latest venture. The magazine was an offbeat look at the world of travel, which touted itself in its March inaugural issue as the only honest travel industry magazine. In a prepared statement, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Banana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s acquisition by The Gap `` allowed us to take our concept further and faster than we ever imagined We never expected to stay with this forever.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> early this morning reached a tentative three-year contract agreement which will be considered at a union meeting today as a possible model for pacts with <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The contract was reached at 2:30 a.m. Union contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> expired at midnight. A majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s 15,000 union members and a majority of the 11 plants represented by the union must approve the pact in order to achieve ratification, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perduyn </PERSON>, public information director for <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>. The contract provides for wage and benefit increases, though precise figures will not be available until the contract is presented to union members. The agreement provides for cost of living adjustments in each year of the contract, along with increases in pension benefits and medical benefits, <PERSON> Perduyn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> vice president of human resources and chief company spokesman at negotiations, said the contract, `` is equitable in that it provides an excellent wage and benefit package while not jeopardizing the company's competitive position.'' The contract provides for <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> to meet to discuss job security, <PERSON> Perduyn </PERSON> said. The pact also provides for a successor clause that ensures continuation of the contract if a plant is sold. International <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will review the proposed agreement today for consideration as a pattern settlement for the rubber industry. The advisory committee and the <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> must approve any tentative contract before it can be presented to union members for a vote. The <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> in April targeted <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> as the pattern-setting company for negotiations in reaching the three-year master contract for all three tire companies. Of the 26,000 union members affected by the contract, 15,000 work for <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, 6,500 for <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION>, and 4,700 for Firestone. Talks began in mid-March for a master contract covering workers at <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> plants in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marys </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>; Sun Prarie, Wisc.; <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Neb </ORGANIZATION>.; and <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GM Wants Healthier Workers, Plans Expansion of Fitness Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to expand a program aimed at improving the health and fitness of workers, especially those who suffer from obesity, high blood pressure, mental stress or substance abuse. `` It's already in place in some areas right now. It will be intensified in July,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s health director. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union will run the program, which will cover roughly 450,000 workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said Wednesday. The No. 1 automaker decided to push the program after reviewing the results of pilot projects that began in 1985 at four auto plants. <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said the plants were in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION>. Screening and counseling could cost up to $ 24 million if all employees participate, says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Erfurt </PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Industrial Relations at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s potential savings, however, could be much greater. <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> estimates 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s workers suffer some type of health problem. The first step will involve blood pressure checks and a review of each employee's medical history. Employees can either enter classes for fitness, losing weight or stoping smoking; adopt self-help programs, or choose one-on-one counseling. Six months later, health care workers will contact employees to check progress. In the pilot program, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> paid the entire cost of initial screening and two-thirds of the follow-up programs, with employees paying the remainder. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s share amounted to roughly $ 53 per worker each year, <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> said. The results of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot project were mixed. In two plants, less than 10 percent of the workers entered the health classes, he said. In the other two factories, nearly half the employees did so, but those workers could choose among self-help programs, counseling or full-scale classes _ unlike employees in the other two plants. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has supported various health programs for years, mostly on a plant-by-plant basis, but this one is broader and more ambitious, <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> said.

 The stock market staged a broad advance today, rebounding from its recent slump. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.92 to 2,000.33 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the early tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 628 up, 307 down and 478 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 22.79 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said a relatively steady showing by the dollar in foreign exchange and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market helped to attract some buyers. Fears of further increases in interest rates appeared to diminish amid signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was n't taking any immediate action to tighten credit.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of shareholders turned out for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting today, where the consumer products giant squared off against <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in a highly visible takeover battle. The two companies waged a proxy war at the meeting, held at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s manufacturing center in this town 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> sought four seats on <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, but <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> hoped a coalition of loyal shareholders and last-minute support from large institutions would render enough votes to repel the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> group. Results of the election are expected later this month. Since <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> went public Feb. 11 with plans to seek control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, the two rivals have traded barbs in the press and the courts. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s board candidates have pledged to support the divestiture of the worldwide empire <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> built around personal care products in an effort to increase profitability and boost the company's stock price. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> contends <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is still mired by the nearly $ 580 million paid to <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to abandon its repeated takeover attempts. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, however, has pointed out to its nearly 27,000 shareholders a steady rise in earnings since the company laid off 2,400 workers and the sale of several unprofitable divisions after signing a 10-year no-takeover pact with <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said it might close some North American plants to further streamline operations. The takeover contest will likely be decided by institutional investors, which own between 60 percent to 65 percent of the 115.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which has run newspapers ads attacking <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s `` greenmail'' payment to <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>, claims to have the support of several major shareholders, including two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pension plans with about 2.1 million shares and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state retirement plan with nearly 2 million shares <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> proxy solicitor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> declined to name supporters, but he suggested many large shareholders will wait until the last moment to make a decision. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON> said that since the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> bid does not seek a complete change in control, some large shareholders may be willing to take a risk for greater profits. `` They look at the short-term gains,'' said <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON>. `` This is only four people on a 12-member board saying they'll push for a sale. It's not a complete switch in management.''

 The stock market rallied sharply today, rebounding from its recent slump. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 29.18 to 2,014.59 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 793 up, 418 down and 477 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 53.25 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said a relatively steady showing by the dollar in foreign exchange and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market helped to attract some buyers to stocks. Fears of further increases in interest rates appeared to diminish amid signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was n't taking any immediate action to tighten credit. Brokers also said traders found some `` bargains'' among the many stocks that have n't responded much so far to generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Gas System led the active list, down -RRB- at 28 -LCB- on top of a 1-point loss Wednesday, when the company cut its quarterly dividend from 79.5 cents a share to 50 cents a share. <ORGANIZATION> Bankamerica </ORGANIZATION>, also among the volume leaders, rose -LCB- to 11. The company reported higher first-quarter profits.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter earnings jumped by 19.2 percent over the same period last year, boosted by an almost two-thirds growth in revenue from its oil exploration services. The world's largest oilfield services company reported a profit of $ 101.01 million, or 37 cents per share, on sales of $ 1.3 billion in the three months ended March 31. That compared with $ 4.99 million, or 2 cents per share, on $ 1.1 billion in revenue during the same period of 1987. Strong world economies helped increase sales, despite weakness in oil prices during the quarter, said <PERSON> Euan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman `` In particular, <ORGANIZATION> Schulmberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the electronics and metering businesses, posted record profits, revenue and orders,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said the company benefitted from a 24 percent gain in sales by the company's oilfield services division, and a 61 percent revenue gain by another division that provides services to locate and evaluate oil and gas. Schlumberger is controlled by the founding French family. It is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and incorporated in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>.

 In the 1800s, the story goes, immigrants coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> believed the streets were paved with gold. Nowadays, it is foreign retailers who are arriving on these shores in search of their fortunes. They are lured by the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market and the American passion for foreign styles and goods. Several are already reporting success. `` We could get a large slice of the apple'' by selling in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirman </PERSON>, who helped introduce the <ORGANIZATION> Sock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, a chain of British hosiery stores, to this country. The most prominent of the new arrivals is <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Canadian concern bought out <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and is in the process of taking over <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. To help finance its purchase of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is selling Allied's <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> chain to another foreign retailer, Marks and <ORGANIZATION> Spencer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Meanwhile, the Australian developer <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> moved into retailing with the purchase last year of the Bonwit Teller, <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> chains. Buying an American company is not the only way to get here. Some smaller companies are striking out on their own. Sock Shop is among them; so are Fil a Fil, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweaterie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tricots </PERSON> <PERSON> Caroll </PERSON>, apparel retailers from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A foreign presence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing industry is nothing new. In 1973, <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, swept in with the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and the now-closed <LOCATION> Gimbels </LOCATION> chain. And the fashionable streets of cities like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have been graced for years by names such as <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Courreges </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>. But what is different about many of these latest arrivals is they are appealing to a larger and different market segment. Many offer moderately-priced merchandise, giving more consumers a chance to buy and wear clothes with foreign labels. With such prices, the new transplants `` have enormous development potential in this market,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Aug </PERSON>, whose company, <ORGANIZATION> Garrick-Aug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, scouts foreign retailers and helps them set up shop here. Many of the retailers are drawn to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in hopes of equaling the success of the Italian retailer <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>, Aug said. <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> has grown to 760 stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ out of more than 4,500 worldwide _ since the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> store with its now-familiar bright green sign opened in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in 1979, said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Italian retailer. Said Aug: `` The rapid growth of <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> generated the interest of the other European merchants to come over here and start moving.'' <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> stores are operated under licensing agreements with the Italian company. The stores sell only <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> fashions, and buy the clothes from <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. Other retailers break into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market through franchises, in which they can profit from an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> operation without having the expense and problems of opening and managing stores. Printemps, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> fashion retailer, is a franchisee of Au Printemps, a French department store chain. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> store, which opened in November, operates autonomously of its namesake, but turns over to Au Printemps a percentage of its sales, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, president of the American company. The Denver store sells French fashions, but is `` Americanized for practicality,'' said <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. `` We've used the name, but -LRB- the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> store is -RRB- not a reflection of the store in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' Some retailers own their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outlets. Sock Shop opened three stores in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in December, and `` we're delighted with the way they're going,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mirman </PERSON>, chairman of the company. Because of its size, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was one of several markets Sock Shop wanted to explore, Ms. <PERSON> Mirman </PERSON> said. The company hopes to open nine more outlets this year and eventually expand beyond <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The retailers generally get some assistance from American advisers or brokers before setting up shop. Ms. <PERSON> Mirman </PERSON> said Sock Shop's entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was facilitated by a minority stockholder who lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweaterie </PERSON> was brought into the American market through a joint venture with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Genser </PERSON>, the company's president here. Unlike many other foreign retailers, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweaterie </PERSON> did not try <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> first, opening instead in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, where <PERSON> Genser </PERSON> lives. The retailer now has 29 stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including several in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The weakness of the dollar since 1985 has helped some foreigners, Aug said, explaining, `` Installation costs would be a fraction of what it would have cost them a few years ago.'' But the lower dollar can be a double-edged sword. `` It's cheaper to set up shop, but that's offset by the fact that the market for goods at these price points does not grow ... when the dollar is buying less,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Garelick </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Rodier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the American arm of the French clothing chain <PERSON> Rodier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genser </PERSON> agreed. `` It has hurt us,'' he said of the dollar's decline `` All of our clothes are made in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' and become more expensive as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency slides. One way to fight the impact of currency fluctuations is to become a more American company. <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> has started manufacturing some of its merchandise in <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` But the style will remain something that's Italian and French _ what <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies have to offer,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who scored a public relations coup over City Hall by rebuilding the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> skating rink, today offered the same deal for repairing the closed <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. The real estate mogul took a tour of the decaying, 85-year-old span, then said he would be willing to put up an estimated $ 250 million, which the government would repay, for repairs. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> rebuilt the Wollman Skating Rink under a similar arrangement. `` An easy solution is to spend a lot of money but if you can spend a little money and get the same results for it, or a better result, that's what I'd be here for,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. The bridge was closed last week when city transportation officials found cracks in its beams. An inspection is under way to determine the extent of the damage, and officials have said the bridge will be closed at least three weeks. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON>, head of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, had invited <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to examine the bridge, and joined him for today's tour. In a letter to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dellibovi </PERSON> lauded him as a builder whose projects come in `` on time, under budget and built to last.'' In 1987, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> showed up the city bureaucracy when he took over repair of the skating rink and finished the job in five months and under budget. The city had spent 7 -LCB- years and $ 12 million on what was supposed to take 2 -LCB- years and $ 4.5 million.

 Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on improved prospects for rain in dry growing regions. Reports of good progress in the Brazilian soybean harvest and weak demand for soybean products on European markets added to the losses in soybean futures, which were down more than 7 -LCB- cents a bushel in early trading. But rain was the major factor affecting all the grain markets, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There are forecasts for systems to come in and get some moisture to the western corn belt states of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and that's important because they've been dry,'' <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said. `` There's also the prospect for some of this moisture getting up into the spring wheat areas'' of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, he said. In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.15 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.03 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 5 \ cents to 7 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 6.61 -LCB- Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .22 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 70.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 79.35 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June at 49.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .05 cent higher with May at 53.40 cents a pound.

Without the change, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings would have been $ 868 million, down 5.9 percent from a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday earnings rose for two of its subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but fell for the third, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because of low interest rates to consumers. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide vehicle sales were down 5.2 percent from first-quarter 1987, but its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of domestic and imported cars rose more than 12 percent. Quarterly truck sales jumped 24 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market grew 4.1 percentage points in the first quarter from the final quarter of 1987 and it gained 2.2 points in truck market share. Overseas sales rose 15.5 percent in the first quarter, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The automaker's operating earnings fell 4.3 percent to $ 657.6 million in the first quarter from $ 687.4 million a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it made improvements in manufacturing efficiency and engineering, but the gains were not enough to offset lower sales, <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s lower earnings and other cost increases. `` We're going to continue to cut costs and improve the efficiency of our plants and the quality of our products,'' the company said in a statement attributed to company Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON>. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> trimmed $ 3.7 billion from its costs under the first phase of a four-year plan that calls for $ 4 billion in cost cuts in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it cut $ 1.3 billion from its costs in first-quarter 1988. The company said it was encouraged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales, which rose against year ago figures for each month of the third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s lineup includes its new mid-size siblings, the Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal and <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it had record truck sales during the quarter.

<TEXT>
 The huge production of American farmers developed at first from a land mass that seemed limitless to early settlers. Until about 1950, when more food was needed, larger crops were planted. But from that point on, farmers relied on boosting the productivity of their land to get more bushels from fewer acres, says <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private, non-profit research organization based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> And to do that, he said, farmers rapidly became hooked on oil _ the fossil-based energy that provides fuel for tractors and irrigation pumps. The fossil fuels, which include natural gas, also became a giant provider of chemical fertilizers used to boost per-acre yields. The basic problem, says <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in World Watch magazine, is that where once there were lakes of oil beneath the surface of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, there are now only puddles. `` In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which produces nearly one-fifth of the world's grain, 80 percent of the oil discovered to date already has been burned,'' he said. `` Current proven reserves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> total 36 billion barrels, enough to supply domestic needs for less than nine years at current rates of use.'' The problem is not confined to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Third World countries which have rising food demands, no oil reserves and limited funds for expanding imports could be headed for traumatic times. The Indian subcontinent, which has nearly a billion people to feed _ and, according to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> projections, another billion on the way before population growth stops _ has less than 1 percent of the world's oil reserves. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which also has a billion people, is expected to show only modest population growth and is in somewhat better shape. But it has only 3 percent of the global oil reserves. `` The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, with reserves of 398 billion barrels, lies at the other end of spectrum,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` It has 56 percent of the world's oil reserves and only 4 percent of the people. Moreover, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s share of the remaining world oil reserves is rising as reserves outside the region are rapidly depleted.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that while <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> _ has had difficulties agreeing on production strategy, `` the growing <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> control of the world's oil is setting the stage for prices to rise in the not-too-distant future.'' He added: `` With petroleum reserves concentrated in one region and with food production becoming more oil-dependent, food security and access to oil are becoming closely entwined issues.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that as the 20th century began, the world's farmers were almost entirely energy self-sufficient. The sun provided energy for crops to grow, livestock provided fertilizer and animal power for tillage. Farmers supplied labor for planting and harvesting. Today, on the average, the world's farmers use the equivalent of more than a barrel of oil to produce a ton of grain. Each year, he said, it takes more. `` Since 1950, agriculture's use of fossil fuels has multiplied sixfold,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Between 1950 and 1985, the farm tractor fleet quadrupled, world irrigated area tripled, and fertilizer use increased ninefold.'' Despite agriculture's heavy reliance on oil, its share of world oil use remains small, so a shortage of oil for food production is not of immediate concern, he said. `` The economics of food production are, however, increasingly shaped by the price of oil,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Moreover, in contrast to some other important oil-using activities _ such as electricity generation, which is reducing its dependence on oil _ agriculture's reliance on oil is rising, making it more vulnerable to future price increases. Some observations: _ Draft animals are still used extensively for tillage in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but the real workhorses of modern agriculture are tractors As much as two-thirds of the world's cropland may now be plowed with tractors. The global tractor fleet has increased from fewer than 6 million in 1950 to 24 million today. _ World use of chemical fertilizers soared from 14 million to 131 million tons between 1950 and 186 As cropland area per person declined, fertilizer use per person increased. This increase was largely reponsible for world grain production climbing to 1.66 billion metric tons from 624 million during the same period. However, in some agriculturally advanced countries fertilizer use is leveling off. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example, fertilizer use peaked in 1981 and then dropped as land prices and the farm economy weakened. _ Irrigation today ranks third behind tractors and fertilizer as an energy user In 1900, world irrigation encompassed an estimated 100 million acres. By 1950, it grew to 230 million acres. Today, the irrigated area is about 670 million acres and has contributed greatly to record advances in global food production. That includes the use of both surface water and underground sources, which require energy-intensive pumping to get it to crops. `` The worldwide production of oil and grain has moved in opposite directions since 1978. Both moved steadily upward from 1950 to 1978, but since then, oil production has fallen while grain output has continued to go up,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` More importantly,'' he added, `` the demand for grain is projected to rise until at least the middle of the next century, while oil production is projected to decline over the same period.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the challenge to the world's agricultural scientists is to devise less energy intensive methods of expanding world food output. Recent moves by American farmers to `` minimum till'' and `` no-till'' crop production is a step in that direction, he said. Another move has been <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s use of more tractors using ethanol, or fuel alcohol made from sugarcane. `` Agriculture can not expand its use of petroleum indefinitely in a world where oil production is falling,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices closed higher in light trading Thursday after the market turned bullish when Wall Street opened higher. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up 5.1 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,791.9. Volume was a light 397.9 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 451.4 million shares. On Wall Street Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average opened higher and moved up more than 30 points by the time <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading wound down. Some traders in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> had predicted that Wall Street would open sharply higher because stock index futures closed at a premium Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and would trigger computer-generated buy programs. `` We were expecting Wall Street to come in stronger to give us the lead we've been looking for all week,'' one equities salesman said. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> reported larger-than-expected bank lending figures which disappointed the market and caused a brief afternoon sell-off, dealers said. Traders cautioned that volume was extremely low, which can magnify price movements. `` It only takes one or two trades to knock prices around in a market such as this one,'' a dealer said.

<HEAD>Profit Up at Time, Times Mirror; Loss Reported at Houghton Mifflin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter profit jumped 43 percent while another publishing and broadcast concern, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its earnings climbed 29 percent from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the publisher <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said normal seasonal sluggishness in educational book orders produced a wider loss for the company in the first quarter. Time, which is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said its magazine, books, programming and cable television operations each turned in improved results. It reported a profit of $ 66 million, or $ 1.13 a share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with earnings of $ 46 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. First-quarter revenue rose 13.4 percent to $ 1.07 billion from $ 939 million a year earlier. Time said the pretax operating profit from its magazine group rose 19 percent to $ 70 million because of a rise in advertising sales that was attributed in part to the Olympics and an increase in circulation revenue. Time publishes Time, Life, People, Sports Illustrated, Money and Fortune magazines, among others. Time's books group broke even in contrast to an operating loss of $ 3 million a year earlier. The group's results reflect a seasonal loss at the Scott, <PERSON> Foresman </PERSON> educational book subsidiary, improved profits at the <ORGANIZATION> Oxmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and Little Brown units and a smaller profit at Time-Life Books. Operating income from the Time programming segment rose 8 percent to $ 39 million, as <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported subscriber growth and the release of several successful HBO videocassettes, including the film `` Platoon.'' In cable television, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s operating profit from its 82 percent-owned <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unit rose 24 percent to $ 42 million, mostly due to new subscribers and price increases. Times-Mirror, which is based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said its results were boosted by strong cable television perfomance and sales of assets. The company reported net earnings of $ 75.1 million, or 58 cents per share, up from $ 58.2 million, or 45 cents per share, in the first quarter of 1987. Revenue for the quarter ended March 27 was $ 797.1 million, up 11.4 percent from $ 715.8 million in 1987. Operating profit improved 17 percent, paced by a 20 percent rise in cable television revenues, absence of losses at the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which was sold in December 1987, and sales of timberlands and the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Times-Mirror publishes the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Courant, the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Sun Newspapers and others. It has interests in broadcast and cable television, book, magazine and other publishing. <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said its loss widened to $ 10.3 million in the first three months of 1988 from $ 6.7 million a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter fell 4.7 percent to $ 37.8 million from $ 39.7 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said the loss reflected the normal seasonal ordering pattern of educational institutions, and said he expects the sluggishness to continue through the second quarter. Educational publishing sales were off 9 percent in the quarter, while early book returns pushed down net sales in the college division by an unspecified amount. General publishing sales were up 3 percent, led by strong sales of juvenile books.

 The stock market put together a broad advance today, rebounding from its recent slump. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 29.84 to 2,015.25 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 967 up, 465 down and 478 unchanged. Analysts said a relatively steady showing by the dollar in foreign exchange and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market helped to attract some buyers to stocks. Fears of further increases in interest rates appeared to diminish amid signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was n't taking any immediate action to tighten credit. Brokers also said traders found some `` bargains'' among the many stocks that have n't responded much so far to generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Gas System dropped -RRB- to 28 -LCB- on top of a 1-point loss Wednesday, when the company cut its quarterly dividend from 79.5 cents a share to 50 cents a share.

The company said the gain was offset by expenses related to restructuring activities and the cost of retirement of high-interest debt. Tobacco sales were up to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.4 billion despite lower domestic volume, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> credited dollar exchange rates internationally and higher prices domestically for the increase. Food sales were $ 2.28 billion, up from $ 2.1 billion, the company said. `` We are especially pleased that these gains were achieved while we continue to invest in strengthening our businesses for future growth,'' Chairman <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. RJR manufactures such products as Winston cigarettes and <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> and Planters foodstuffs.

 Billionaire couple <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, in a repeat of last week's state court appearance, pleaded innocent today to federal charges stemming from an alleged $ 4 million tax scam. Their pleas of `` not guilty'' _ the only words they spoke during arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ were followed by a date with federal marshals for fingerprinting and mug shots. The 79-year-old <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his wife, whose combined estimated net worth of $ 1.4 billion makes them among the world's richest couples, sat in court with several defendants in the `` Pizza Connection II'' heroin smuggling trial. At the government's recommendation, the Helmsleys were released without bail, but must surrender their passports pending trial. The same applied to two former <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees who are co-defendants and also pleaded innocent. The couple's lawyers have charged that the wealth and prominence of the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>, who have vast commercial real estate holdings including a string of hotels, was a factor in their indictment. `` The fact that the prosecutors themselves have stated that their investigations were triggered by articles in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> newspaper has led many to conclude that both the state and the federal indictment are motivated by the prominence of the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>,'' lawyers <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> said in a statement. The federal charges, a 47-count indictment that accuses the Helmsleys of improperly claiming $ 4 million in deductions, are part of an `` unfair and groundless'' attack, the lawyers said. The indictment alleges that the couple masked expenditures for home renovations and other personal purchases as business expenses. The attorneys accused prosecutors of leaks involving the case; singling out the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> due to their high profiles; and basing state and federal charges on false allegations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> last week announced twin indictments for tax fraud against <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his wife, the self-proclaimed `` hotel queen.'' The couple was named with two <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees in a 188-count state indictment and the federal indictment for masking the renovations and several purchases as business expenses. They pleaded innocent April 14 in state court after they were booked and fingerprinted. The federal indictment additionally charges Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 67, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with attempted extortion of <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees and contractors. In addition to <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, former <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> financial manager <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION> was named in both indictments.

 <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its first-quarter earnings dropped 36 percent because of a $ 20 million arbitrator's award against an insurance subisidiary and early payment of high-interest debt The aerospace, commercial products and financial services company reported Thursday it earned $ 38.7 million, or 43 cents per share, down from $ 60.2 million, or 72 cents per share, during the first three months of 1987. Revenue for the quarter ended April 2, 1988, was unchanged from the year-earlier period at $ 1.8 billion. The earnings drop was attributed to the $ 20 million award against <ORGANIZATION> Balboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Avco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

Earnings also were reduced by a one-time $ 9.7 million expenditure for early redemtion of $ 130 million in high-interest debt. Without those charges, income from continuing operations was up 11 percent. Referring to gains in aerospace propulsion and finance divisions and a reduction in the company's federal tax rate, Chairman <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said, `` the favorable first quarter earnings from continuing operations get us off to an excellent start this year.''

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter profit fell 15 percent from the same period of 1987, when the giant financial services company recorded a big one-time tax-related gain. The company, however, said its <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> division, which runs its credit card business, had record earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also posted strong income during the period, the first to include <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> results, it said. For the first three months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> netted $ 266 million, or 62 cents a share, on revenue of $ 5.3 billion. That compared with a restated profit of $ 314 million, or 71 cents, and $ 4.1 billion in revenue a year ago. Last year's net income included $ 49 million of deferred income tax benefits recorded to comply with new accounting rules. Excluding those benefits, the first quarter earnings that year would have totaled $ 265 million, about the same as this year. Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called `` most impressive'' the latest quarterly results of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> units. At <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, earnings climbed 18 percent to a record $ 171 million from $ 145 million. Revenue totaled $ 1.6 billion, up 17 percent from last year. The company said its credit-card charge volume and average travelers checks outstanding all posted `` double-digit gains.'' <ORGANIZATION> IDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> had a 19 percent jump in earnings to a record $ 31 million from $ 26 million, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said. The company said annuity and life insurance operations led the increase and that earnings also were helped by higher management fees. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 811 milion, compared with $ 78 million last year. The results included <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, which was acquired by the securities firm late last year. Revenue totaled $ 2.5 billion, up from $ 1.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said its share of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION>'s first quarter net was $ 52 million, reflecting the company's reduced equity interest. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reported first quarter net income of $ 27 million, after absorbing a one-time after-tax charge of $ 3.8 million related to staff reductions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In 1987, first quarter net income totaled $ 56 million, including a $ 19 million gain from accounting changes. `` Although <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s net was down from a year ago, its emphasis on private banking and other fee-generating activities continues to yield positive results,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The company said its banking unit `` continued its orderly exit from cross-border term lending.'' Its provision for loan losses, particulary those from troubled Third World countries, rose 56 percent to $ 7.8 million from $ 5 million.

 The stock market turned upward today, rebounding from its recent slump. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 10.45 to 1,995.86 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 862 up, 595 down and 483 unchanged. Analysts said a relatively steady showing by the dollar in foreign exchange and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market helped to attract some buyers to stocks. Fears of further increases in interest rates appeared to diminish amid signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was n't taking any immediate action to tighten credit.

 Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as rain dampened the dry fields of the western Corn Belt and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean harvest accelerated.

<TEXT>
 Aboard thousands of airline flights the smoking lamp is about to be extinguished. The federal ban on cigarette smoking on domestic flights of two hours or less _ about 80 percent of the total _ takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Beforehand, some avid smokers are reconsidering train travel while others search for ways to keep their tobacco urges under control, at least for a few hours. Government and airline industry officials said Thursday they expect the new smoking restrictions to cause few problems, although some confusion may exist for the first few days. `` On the whole I think we're in reasonably good shape on this,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>, whose departmentissued the new restrictions earlier this month in compliance with a law enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have come under some criticism, however, for not pushing the airlines hard enough to publicize details of the new restrictions and avoid passenger confusion. `` The airlines do not have a uniform policy to inform the public'' about the new rules, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>, president of the 21,000-member Association of Flight Attendants. She said at least one airline inserted details about the new requirements into flight crew manuals only this week and four airlines are continuing to book seats in smoking sections of no-smoking flights. The airlines said they hope a series of announcements to passengers _ both before and after boarding a flight _ will limit the confusion and perhaps head off any disturbances. Industry spokesmen noted that a smoking ban on flights within in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has been largely accepted since it went into effect at the first of the year. An estimated 13,600 domestic flights a day will be affected by the no-smoking edict. International flights are not affected and the length of a flight will be determined by the time shown in the airlines' official schedule. Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes beyond two hours, smoking will be prohibited if the schedule has it as lasting two hours or less, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The government has defined a flight as being any single segment between two cities. Thus, for example, a traveler flying from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with a stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> would not be able to smoke on the first leg of the flight, but would be allowed to do so on the second, longer leg. One major carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, is prohibiting smoking on all its flights within the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but so far no other airline has followed suit. `` We do n't think our customers want us to become a non-smoking airline. If they tell us to do so, we will,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and himself a heavy smoker, said recently. The battle over whether airline passengers should be allowed to smoke has been raging for nearly two decades, and forces on both sides of the issue say the fight is far from over despite the new restrictions. Anti-smoking groups promise to push for a total ban on smoking aboard airliners, while the tobacco industry and many of its most loyal customers are gearing up to have the limited smoking prohibitions reversed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation enacted last year calls for the issue to re-examined in two years. `` Believe me, we're working full speed ahead and so is the tobacco industry,'' says <PERSON> Ahron </PERSON> <PERSON> Leightman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is halftime in a football game. We're up 6-0, and during halftime the forces are regrouping. `` We remain very opposed to the two-hour ban,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the industry trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Two-thirds of airline passengers favor a smoking ban on airlines, according to a study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said they instituted their ban on all flights after a survey showed only one in 10 passengers wanted to sit in the smoking section. Neverthelss, some heavy smokers may find the adjustment difficult, said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, which has worked with hospitals and corporations to help people deal with stress management including smoking problems. ` Certainly when people fly there's a sense of loss of control. When we feel lack of control we feel stress, so the urges of a smoker to smoke are more pronounced among people when they fly,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. He suggested a few tips to battle the no-smoking pangs: _ Stay away from alcohol because it increases the desire to smoke Also avoid coffee or soft drinks containing caffeine. _ Close the ashtrays near your seat to eliminate the smell of tobacco that is likely to linger _ Walk in the cabin when the smoking urge become acute _ Keep your mind and hands busy by reading, working a crossword puzzle or playign with a deck of cards _ When the urge peaks, take a deep breath, hold the air for 3 seconds and slowely exhale _ Place a rubber band around the wrist our your smoking arm and when the urge hits `` give yourself a little zap. `` We're trying to keep people from climbing the cabin walls,'' said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its earnings jumped 62 percent in the first quarter, marking the third straight quarter of profitability for the recovering banking giant. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's third-largest bank holding company, said its first-quarter earnings totaled $ 109 million, or 56 cents per share, up from $ 67 million, or 34 cents per share, in the first three months of 1987 Operating profit, which excludes one-time gains or losses, also was on the positive side for the third straight quarter, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, chief financial officer. He declined to give a dollar value for operating profit. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> returned to profitability in the third quarter of 1987 after six straight quarters of red ink blamed on loan losses, high expenses and reserves set aside for foreign debt. Net losses from 1985 through the first half of 1987 totaled $ 1.92 billion. `` <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s solid performance in the first quarter clearly demonstrates that our recovery is continuing,'' said A.W. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON>, the bank's chairman. `` We're making steady progress toward our goals, but many challenges still lie ahead.'' Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31 reached $ 775 million, up from $ 729 million in the same period last year. Non-interest income during the first quarter this year was $ 424 million, down from $ 715 million in the first quarter of 1987. Net credit losses were $ 92 million, down from $ 315 million in the first quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s assets stood at $ 94.3 billion. Last month's $ 28 million settlement of a class-action suit by stockholders who said the company concealed information about its financial problems was provided for earlier and did not affect first-quarter results, the company said. The company is expected to eliminate about 5,000 jobs this year from its workforce of approximately 59,500.

 Evidence presented in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>'s closely watched `` cigarette trial'' indicates tobacco companies conspired to hide the dangers of smoking, and the jury trial should continue, a federal judge declared today. At the same time, however, Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> dismissed a claim that the three companies sued in the liability case _ <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ caused <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lung cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette. Attorneys for Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> argued that the companies knew they could develop a safer cigarette that had less potential of causing cancer. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, died in 1984 after 40 years of smoking. But the judge said the attorneys for Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s estate, carrying on a lawsuit filed before she died, had not presented evidence to support that claim. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said the jury trial will continue over whether the three manufacturers conspired to misrepresent and conceal facts regarding the dangers of smoking. He also said Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s estate could continue seeking punitive damages. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said that the evidence indicates that the cigarette industry `` entered into a sophisticated conspiracy. `` The conspiracy was organized to refute, undermine and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical community and, at the same time, to confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence smoking,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> also said `` a jury might reasonably conclude ... that the defendants in particular, and the industry in general, intentionally and willfully ignored the known health consequences to consumers from the sale of their products.'' `` The evidence presented also permits the jury to find the tobacco industry conspiracy vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and devastating in its results,'' the judge said. But <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> dismissed claims that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> of the dangers of cigarettes. The judge said Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> did not start smoking cigarettes manufactured by those two companies until she was a veteran smoker and the companies had no duty to warn her about any dangers until she became a consumer of their products. Similar claims against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, however, were allowed to continue. The trial, which began Feb. 1, is viewed by both the industry and smoking opponents as critical in the tobacco companies' efforts to defend against future liability cases.

 A sudden afternoon downdraft wiped out an early gain in the stock market today, leaving prices little changed from Wednesday. Analysts said swings in prices of stock-index futures prompted professionals engaged in program trading to sell the futures and buy individual stocks in the early going. At midafternoon, they said, the balance abruptly reversed and selling programs hit the stock market. Brokers said the effect was especially pronounced because many other investors have been shying away from the stock market lately, and thus contributing to its potential volatility. They noted that many stocks have n't responded much so far to generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter.

 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the nation's biggest chain of fast-food restaurants, said Thursday its first-quarter profit rose 18 percent from a year ago as its revenue climbed 15 percent. First-quarter earnings rose to $ 125.8 million, or 67 cents a share, for the first three months of 1988 compared with earnings of $ 106.9 million, or 56 cents per share, in 1987. Total revenue for the first-quarter climbed to $ 1.23 billion from $ 1.07 billion in 1987. Systemwide sales, which represents sales at franchised and affiliated restaurants as well as those that the company operates, rose 15 percent to $ 3.59 billion in the first quarter from $ 3.12 billion in 1987. McDonald's recently opened its 10,000 th restaurant in <LOCATION> Dale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The company said the systemwide sales increase resulted from higher sales from existing restaurants, new restaurant expansion and the effect of stronger foreign currencies against the dollar. Domestic sales, helped by new product introductions such as `` Cheddar Melt'' hamburgers, climbed by 10 percent to $ 2.53 billion, the company said. The company, which recently opened restaurants in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, said the decline in the dollar helped it post a 30 percent gain in sale outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to $ 1.06 billion during the quarter from $ 811.6 million a year earlier. Without the decline in the dollar, foreign sales would have risen only 17 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Dollar Narrowly Higher; Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The dollar moved narrowly higher against most major currencies Thursday in uneventful trading. Gold prices fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 454.65 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 456 late Wednesday. Traders said the dollar remained in a narrow range throughout the session, and volume was light. `` It's the same pattern we've seen the last couple of days,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that the dollar continued to `` take somewhat of a back seat against the British pound,'' with the pound testing the $ 1.90 mark against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. A report of faster-than-expected growth in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s money supply led market participants in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to believe sterling interest rates will not be lowered. `` That makes the pound an attractive alternative to the dollar,'' <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that market participants remain bearish about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. But most traders believe fears of central bank intervention keep investors from trying to aggressively sell their dollar holdings. The dollar also rose earlier in uneventful European dealings. Foreign exchange dealers said an absence of fundamental news kept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency in a narrow range for mostly technical reasons. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 124.30. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a slightly lower 124.18 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 124.27 yen, up from 124.15 yen on Wednesday. One British pound cost $ 1.8990 in the British capital, slightly more expensive for buyers than $ 1.8930 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.8973 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.89125 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.66715 West German marks, up from 1.66485; 1.37675 Swiss francs, up from 1.3764; 5.6605 French francs, up from 5.6540; 1,238.625 Italian lire, up from 1,237.875, and 1.23505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.22905. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.6660 West German marks, up from 1.6635; 1.3755 Swiss francs, up from 1.3745; 5.6550 French francs, up from 5.6490; 1.8675 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8630; 1,238.50 Italian lire, up from 1,234.50; and 1.2329 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2283.

 A sharp afternoon selloff wiped out an early gain in the stock market Thursday, leaving prices little changed from the day before. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 30 points at its midsession peak, closed with a 1.99 gain at 1,987.40. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 688 up, 801 down and 501 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 168.44 million shares, against 147.59 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index edged up .10 to 145.23. Analysts said swings in prices of stock-index futures prompted professionals engaged in program trading to sell the futures and buy individual stocks in the early going. At midafternoon, they said, the balance abruptly reversed and selling programs hit the stock market. Brokers said the effect was especially pronounced because many other investors have been shying away from the stock market lately, and thus contributing to its potential volatility. They noted that many stocks have n't responded much so far to generally strong earnings reports for the first quarter. For all its erratic behavior, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was able to break a three-session losing streak during which it fell 28.52 points. Observers noted, however, that many investors were still in a very touchy mood a week after the Dow took a 101.46-point drop on April 14. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 -RCB- to 46 -LCB- in active trading. Analysts cited disappointment over some aspects of the company's financial results for the first quarter. Among other prominent computer and technology issues, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 -RRB- to 99 |, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> lost -LCB- to 112 -RRB- By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 | to 45 -RCB- The company introduced its version of a line of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> personal computers. A few issues did benefit from positive earnings reports. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, which posted a profit in the first quarter against a loss in the like period a year ago, jumped 2 -LCB- to 30 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> added -LCB- to 36 -LCB- with a boost from sharply higher quarterly earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -LCB- to 41 -RCB- as traders awaited the outcome of a proxy fight between the company and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> for four seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 1.74 billion, or 0.07 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 194.56 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose .33 to 298.66, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .29 at 256.42. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 1.04 to 373.20. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 296.71, down 1.01.

^Eds: New with bill passing.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House today passed sweeping trade legislation, ignoring fresh veto threats from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and defiantly upholding the measure's embattled plant closings provisions. `` Our future is not in the past,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said as he urged approval of the bill with the plant closings feature intact. `` We can regain our competitiveness ... We can be No. 1 again.'' The bill passed by a vote of 312-107. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on the road in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said he would veto the legislation if it arrived on his desk with the plant closings provision included in it. He also sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., saying, `` I want a trade bill. `` I will work vigorously to secure one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And I will urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill immediately after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sustains my forthcoming veto'' of the current trade bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected 253-167 a move by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> to return the trade bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee with orders to drop the plant closings provision. Critics of the provision warned that it would not only trigger a veto but that if it went into law it would cripple American business by drying up capital for investment, frightening off customers and causing other problems. The measure would require all but the smallest employers to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. The provision completely overshadowed the centerpiece features of the legislation which would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs to aid industries threatened by foreign competition and retaliate against international trade violations. Scores of other features range from repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies. Republicans portrayed the measure as doomed to a veto with the plant closings provision still part of it. `` I'm more interested in plant openings than plant closings,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` We can exorcise this demon,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. The legislation would overhaul the system under which the government retaliates against international trade violations and uses import curbs to aid American industries hurt by surging foreign competition. These provisions have figured little in battles over the bill in recent weeks, however. The White House has issued numerous threats of a presidential veto if the plant-closings provisions remain. Efforts to whisk the bill through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday were stalled for hours over Democratic concerns that <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> would muster the strength on the floor to send the measure back to the committee. `` It is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for him to go ahead with his plan. The idea of a veto over plant closings is proving less than appetizing to lawmakers with a host of narrow election-year items tucked into the trade bill, ranging from repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday to try to rally <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to oppose the measure if the measures on plant closings remained in. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday the administration was `` pessimistic'' about chances that lawmakers would send the president legislation he would sign. `` I would say we are not too optimistic at this point,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The indications have been that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not going to relent on plant closings as well as some of the other provisions, so I would say that we are pretty pessimistic that we will get a bill that we could sign.''

 Assets of the nation's 421 money market mutual funds fell $ 850.6 million in the latest week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The decline to $ 273.93 billion in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $ 2.02 billion drop in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the latest week, assets of 210 general purpose funds rose $ 1.01 billion to $ 83.24 billion while assets of 97 broker-dealer funds rose 246.1 million to $ 117.55 billion. But the trade group said assets of 114 institutional funds fell $ 2.10 billion to $ 73.14 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds slipped in the week ended Tuesday to 6.09 percent from 6.10 percent the previous week, according to <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield edged up to 6.07 percent from 6.06 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 41 days, down from 42 days the previous week, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. Separately, the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to 5.68 percent as of Wednesday from 5.67 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, fell to 5.13 percent from 5.14 percent. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.85 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.82 percent the previous week. Yields were 7.17 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.14 percent; 7.59 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, up from 7.57 percent; and 8.04 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.01 percent

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Fall With Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as rain dampened the dry fields of the western Corn Belt and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean harvest accelerated. Grains also finished lower. On other markets, energy futures advanced; stock-index futures plunged; precious metals were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Rain in western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where spring planting has just begun, melted fears that dry conditions would delay germination of seeds, analysts said. Soybean prices came under additional pressure from the Brazilian soybean harvest, now more than 50 percent complete, and the beginning of the Argentine soybean harvest, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They should be 80 to 85 percent finished in May,'' he said of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> harvest. `` Then our crush and export rate will tail off, and you do n't get as much domestic meal feeding anyway as we get into the warmer weather.'' Further pressure on the soy complex came from an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> statement that it did not expect the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to offer the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 170,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil under its Export Enhancement Program, <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.14 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 2 \ cents lower with May at $ 2.02 \ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.63 \ a bushel; soybeans were 7 \ cents to 11 cents lower with May at $ 6.59 Energy futures staged a broad rally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on reports that seven non-OPEC countries would meet with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price committee next week in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> to discuss production cuts. `` It seems the announcement and confirmation that the cartel would be meeting with non-OPEC producers was a very positive sign,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 36 cents to 38 cents higher with June at $ 18.36 a barrel; heating oil was .76 cent to 1.23 cents higher with May at 50.54 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .70 cent to 1.03 cents higher with May at 52.45 cents a gallon Stock-index futures plunged late in the afternoon on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news that the federal budget deficit for March was a lower-than-expected $ 29 billion, analysts said. `` It was just like the good old days, very volatile,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, executive director of financial futures for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, referring to the relative calm in futures trading since the stock market crash. Technically-based selling accelerated the dive, he said. The contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.7 points lower at 256.20. Gold futures finished modestly lower on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, basically following the lead of platinum futures, which posted steeper losses, analysts said. Silver was marginally higher. The markets reflected concerns that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wants to force interest rates higher to bring in more foreign investors to prop up the dollar and ward off a recession, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Recession fears have been absent recently from the metals markets, which have generally been trading higher on expecations of increased inflation. But <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said traditional indicators of inflation _ such as widespread price increases for goods and services _ have not surfaced. `` One has to seriously question this whole idea about inflation,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may be using inflation as a scapegoat to say we have to tighten money and get the interest rates up higher.'' Platinum settled $ 5.40 to $ 5.90 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with July at $ 526.70 a troy ounce. On the Comex, gold was $ 1.60 to $ 2.20 lower with June at $ 457.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent higher across the board with May at $ 6.46 a troy ounce. Cattle futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in position-evening ahead of two <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed reports due out after Friday's close. Analysts expect the monthly seven-state and quarterly 13-state reports to show active placement of cattle onto feedlots, but only moderate marketings, which would translate into greater cattle supplies in coming months. Pork futures finished mostly lower on lower cash prices, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .60 cent higher with June at 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 79.40 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 48.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent lower to .05 cent higher with May at 53.12 cents a pound

<HEAD>Tandy Announces Fast PC And Breakthrough Compact Disk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stepped up in the big leagues of both personal computing and music Thursday with a fast new PC and a new kind of re-recordable compact disk. Analysts said both announcements demonstrated the evolution of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> as a leader in technology. `` These guys are changing their image from being just a retailer to being an innovator,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 2.62 -LCB- a share to $ 45.75 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading The new personal computer is due for volume shipments in July and is likely to be the first on the market that follows the design of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old Personal System-2. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, announced a PS-2-compatible machine on Monday, but said it would not be available until the final quarter of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s version has technological advantages over <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s own computer. While a new personal computer was widely expected, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> pulled a surprise with its announcement of an unusual compact disk that can be repeatedly erased and re-recorded. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said the compact disk, known as the Thor CD, would have the advantages of huge storage capacity and high fidelity without the disadvantage of being unalterable. It will be available for music in 1 -LCB- to two years and for data about a year after that, once recording and playback devices are built, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said. The Thor CD could also be played _ although not recorded on _ in standard compact disk players. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> will make Thor CD equipment and license other companies to make it and expects that some day the invention might yield the company `` hundreds of millions of dollars'' a year in additional profits from sales and royalties, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference. The announcement drew a critical response from the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> because it would allow people to make high-quality recordings of commercial compact disks at home. The group has been battling against digital audio tape, another technology that is ideal for copying. `` We're always concerned about technologies that threaten to enable consumers to infringe on copyrights,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Trish </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimers </PERSON>. Indeed, opposition from the recording industry might hold up the <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> invention, said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Laub </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Vision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based consulting firm. As with music, the Thor CD would allow computer users to create their own data libraries. On its new Tandy 5000 MC personal computer, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> tried to assure potential customers that the machine would not be knocked down by a patent lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The company said the computer was covered by an existing patent cross-licensing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, although it said certain PS-2 patents that may be issued to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in the future are still subject to negotiations. Analysts are betting that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will not try to block <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>. They say <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s quality is high enough that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be embarrassed by shoddy goods. And they say the companies are not direct competitors, with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> focusing on the Fortune 1000 and <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> focusing on what it calls the `` Unfortunate 6 Million'' small and medium-sized companies. In addition, some big <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> customers have been telling <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> they would feel more comfortable buying the Personal System-2 if they knew there was another company that could serve as a second source for the product. Tandy seems to have shaken off its image as a company for hobbyists, tinkerers and bargain hunters. `` Tandy is a class-act company,'' said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, editor of Release 1.0, a computer newsletter. The suggested price for one popular configuration of the Tandy 5000 MC with a 40-megabyte hard disk drive is $ 6,499, compared to $ 6,995 for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s PS-2 Model 80 with a 44-megabyte hard disk drive.

 All three of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s measures of the nation's money supply rose in early April, the central bank said Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 1.1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 766.2 billion in the week ended April 11 from $ 765.1 billion the previous week. The central bank said the measure known as M2 rose $ 7.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 2,991.2 billion from $ 2,983.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 3.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,756.6 billion from $ 3,752.9 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 1.36 billion in the week ended April 13 compared with a gain of $ 1.76 billion the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 515 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 167 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 275.3 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 274.0 billion two weeks earlier

 Both <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the investor group battling to win four seats on its board hinted at victory Thursday as the scramble for shareholder votes gave way to the ballot count that will determine the winner. Shareholder proxy ballots were filed Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, a key step in the four-month effort by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> force a sale or merger of the Boston-based personal products company Although preliminary results are not expected for at least a week, both <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> executives expressed optimism they would prevail. `` Obviously, we think we will win,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said after the three-hour annual meeting at which several shareholders drew applause for criticizing New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think we're ahead and we're looking forward to the results.''

The contest likely will be decided by institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, which own between 60 percent to 65 percent of the 115.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> controls 6.76 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, about 5.8 percent of the company's shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> also claims to have the support of several major shareholders. Since early March, both sides have been battling in the courts and the press while seeking support from the company's nearly 27,000 shareholders. In a final presentation at Thursday's meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told nearly 800 shareholders their investments would produce large financial dividends through the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate empire. <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> would remove provisions designed to shield the company from takeovers and to protect top management posts. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said the group seeks to sell the company as a whole entity, except for the possible divestment of some divisions. In the meantime, he pledged to devote more corporate resources to research and development and product marketing. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said no potential buyers have approached <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> so far, although he indicated the group would consider a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 abandoned repeated attempts to take over <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> after receiving a nearly $ 580 million stock repurchase, and signed a 10-year pact not to seek control of the company <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON>, one of the directors whose seat is being challenged, denied published reports that six suitors hade signed an agreement to purchase the company. <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> officers gave presentations stressing the company's worldwide growth and increased profitability since its restructuring and dismissal of 2,400 workers after signing the <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> pact. No mention was made of plans to close plants or further reduce its 30,000-member workforce. In addition to the proxy fight, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> are entangled in legal battles. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is attempting to have the results of the shareholder vote invalidated, and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> has sued <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly using false and misleading information in its campaign to win shareholder votes. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> nominated <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollust </PERSON> and former cable television executive <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassler </PERSON> for three-year director posts. In addition to <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON>, the company placed <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> directors <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouraker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> on the ballot.

 <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose 132 percent and its revenue rose 108 percent in the latest quarter, the mushrooming maker of personal computers said Thursday. Among other technology companies, semiconductor maker <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said its profit fell 4.9 percent and minicomputer maker <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Westboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said it made a profit in contrast to a year-earlier loss. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> announced separately that <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Junkins </PERSON> will take on the title of chairman upon the retirement of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, which was previously announced. <PERSON> Junkins </PERSON> is already president and chief executive. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, which reached the Fortune 500 and the $ 1 billion annual sales mark faster than any other company, continued to skyrocket in the first quarter. The Houston-based company attributed the gains to international market growth, a strong brand image and sales of its top-of-the-line products, including the Deskpro 386-20. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose to $ 47 million, or $ 1.21 a share, from $ 20 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 439 million from $ 211 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, which makes computer chips, defense electronics and other products, said its profit fell to $ 85.5 million, or 95 cents a share, from $ 89.9 million, or $ 1.12 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15.4 percent to $ 1.47 billion from $ 1.27 billion. Data General said net income for its second fiscal quarter totaled $ 17.2 million, or 57 cents a share, a reversal from a $ 42.6 million loss in the same period last year. The computer maker reported revenues of $ 349.7 million, a 10.9 percent increase over last year's $ 315.2 million. The company attributed part of the rise to the $ 5.9 million sale of a company facility in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, during the quarter. For the six-month period ending March 26, <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 29.6 million, or $ 1.01 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 39.3 million in the same period a year earlier.

 Corn syrup maker <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rejected as inadequate a $ 1.33 billion takeover bid from a British company Thursday but indicated it might entertain a better offer. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which made the $ 32-a-share cash tender offer April 8, declined comment on <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s decision but one analyst said he expected the British sugar refiner to increase its bid. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> did announce it has arranged a $ 1.3 billion loan agreement wiht a group of 14 banks to finance a takeover. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> stock rose 75 cents to $ 37.50 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, the nation's second-largest refiner of corn sweeteners, said it would consider various alternatives for enhancing shareholder value. The options include a financial restructuring or recapitalization, issuing stock to a third party, selling all or part of the company, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said in a letter to stockholders. Spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON> said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> had held discussions with at least one other party but added that the company wanted to remain independent. `` I think the board has asked management to look at all the various alternatives because as part of its fiduciary responsibility they've got to be able to make the best judgment possible for shareholders,'' <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON> said. One option likely to present itself is a higher offer from <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think they officially put the ` for sale' sign on the company,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. `` But from a shareholder's point of view, they said all the right things: That they're contemplating alternative moves designed to enhance the value of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s stock beyond the $ 32 that <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> offered.'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> probably was worth about $ 40 a share. But he said he doubted a bidding war would develop. `` I do n't think there's a line of bidders that want to get into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sweetener industry,'' he said. `` It's a competitive market and it takes special managerial skills.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s second-largest sugar refiner. An acquisition of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> would give it a foothold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sweetener market and make it the only supplier of all three types of sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s owns nearly 5 percent of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s 30.4 million outstanding shares of common stock and is offering to buy all outstanding shares of all classes of stock in a deal it valued at $ 1.33 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s chairman, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, has said he would move the company's headquarters from suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, the site of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s largest corn-processing plant and the company's home until three years ago <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is a holding company formed in early 1985 for the A.E. <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a food-service supplier.

<HEAD>House Passes Trade Bill by Wide Margin Despite Veto Threat</HEAD>

House-Senate conference committee</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Thursday passed a sweeping trade bill, delivering a sharp blow to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as supporters of the hotly disputed measure piled up enough votes to override his threatened veto. `` Our future is n't in the past,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, declared as he fought a move to return the bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and drop a plant-closings provision that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he could not approve. `` We can regain our competitiveness. ... We can be No. 1 again. The final tally, 312-107, contradicted numerous forecasts that the bill's sponsors would fail to produce the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto. But many lawmakers, even if they had their doubts, appeared to have no taste in an election year for going on record against a measure billed as a plan to upgrade American competitiveness. The bill was a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise on two competing measures that passed both chambers last year. The measure now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, planned to begin debate He was shooting for a vote on final passage early next week. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure after defeating, 253-167, a move by Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., to throw the bill back to the conference committee and drop the plant-closings provision <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on the road in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said he would veto the bill if it came to him with the plant-closings provision intact. He also sent a letter to <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, saying, `` I want a trade bill.'' `` I will work vigorously to secure one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And I will urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sustains my forthcoming veto'' of the current trade bill. Controversy over the plant-closings provision overshadowed central features of the bill, which would streamline the way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs to aid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries and retaliate against international trade violations. Scores of other provisions ranged from repeal of the windfall profits tax to billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies. Dueling over plant closings provision went on almost to the last minute. `` I am more interested in plant openings than plant closings,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. However, Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., said it would be a mistake to allow such an important measure to become hung up on one provision `` It is so modest, so watered down, so full of exceptions'' that it probably will not have as much effect as lawmakers intended, he said. Debate focused heavily on the provision that would require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of upcoming plant closings and large-scale layoffs. The measure contains a number of exceptions for companies that sudenly find themselves in an emergency. The centerpiece provisions would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs and other means to aid industries threatened by foreign competition and retaliate against international trade violatrions. Scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in new agricultural subsidies. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., said the bill for the first time `` establishes a policy that will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a winner in international competitive markets. But Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., whose amendment to roll back Japanese trade surpluses was dropped earlier, said the measure did not go far enough in forcing open foreign markets Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said that with the ink barely dry he had discovered that the 1,000-page bill would increase the amount of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> ethanol allowed in duty-free `` I thought we were going to try to create jobs, I thought we were going to create markets,'' <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> said. `` But here we are trying to give away some of our own jobs and give away some of our own markets, just exactly the oppsosite of what we said we were trying to do.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said `` This bill will put pressure on our trading competitors to open up their markets and play fairly and squarely with the trading system that we already have. Republican critics of the plant-closings provision cited business fears that plant-closings notice would reduce credit, frighten customers, cut productivity and perhaps lead to sabotage among disappointed employees facing layoffs. They also said it had no direct connection with the trade issue.

<HEAD>NBC Employee Survey Finds Anxiety About GE</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> employees are skeptical of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to continue ownership of the network, according to results of a survey conducted by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and described in a letter sent to employees by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday. `` GE is viewed with skepticism and uncertainty. More employees feel that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will not continue its <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ownership, even with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> performing well, than believe GE will be around for the long haul,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. He said even more employees believe <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will not allow <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to operate independently, and many do n't like the effect the new corporate owner has had on their working environment. GE, which is based in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, acquired <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 as part of its purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> executive before taking over as <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer. A `` high percentage'' of employees do not feel their jobs are secure, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, he said, they feel better off than people in similar jobs in other areas of the industry. `` While almost half of the employees say they are not encouraged by the direction they see <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> taking today, a majority of employees say they are not likely to leave the company because of dissatisfaction,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in the letter. `` All of this anxiety is understandable,'' he wrote. `` Change is always stressful and the vast changes that are taking place in the broadcasting business have understandably resulted in considerable employee anxiety and insecurity. The survey clearly reflects this.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said most employees said they were happy with their jobs and a majority were felt their salaries compared favorably to the rest of the industry. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> concluded the letter by assuring employees that `` you have been heard.'' He said next month employees would be asked to participate in discussions of problems mentioned in the survey. `` Creating an atmosphere in which we can go forward with far less doubt about <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s goals and intentions is the first priority of our management team for the coming year,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> bank director and her husband have settled insider trading charges by paying more than $ 1.25 million in profits and fines to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The commission said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, radiologists from <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, surrendered the money without admitting or denying the allegations, which stem from her former position as a director in now defunct <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, acquired by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> last year. The couple agreed to pay $ 774,302 in profits from the trades and a one-time penalty of $ 480,916 under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged that Mrs. <PERSON> Leone </PERSON>, through her privileged position at the bank, learned last summer of the impending merger with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> and shared the secret with her husband. He in turn allegedly leaked it to others, who were n't identified by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The couple bought thousands of shares of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> in the over-the-counter market in the weeks prior to the merger announcement at a price of about $ 54 a share, well below the $ 77 market price when the merger was announced Aug. 5, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged. The final merger price was $ 82 a share. The agency said it investigated after the surveillance department of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors over-the-counter trading, noticed unusually heavy trading activity in <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> prior to the merger announcement. National Westminster is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported its first-quarter profit rose 53 percent because of increased volume, higher selling prices and relatively stable raw material prices in the chemicals and plastics business.

The company said sales for the quarter rose 16 percent to $ 1.95 billion from $ 1.6 billion in the same period last year. The current upswing in the chemicals and plastics industry is unprecedented in recent times because it is not driven by an energy crisis, high inflation, or major inventory building, said Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

<HEAD>USG To Let Shareholders Vote On Lowering Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would allow its stockholders to decide whether the company should drop its `` poison-pill'' takeover defense, which is a major impediment to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> group's $ 1.63 billion takeover attempt. But <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> said the offer was conditioned on the willingness of the investor group, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, to extend the deadline for its takeover bid, a provision criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. Desert Partners's offer of $ 42 a share cash for 85 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s stock has been spurned as inadequate by the company, a maker of building materials. USG's poison pill seeks to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing management to issue more shares if a bidder acquires more than 20 percent of the company's stock. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 9.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock, repeatedly has called on USG to rescind the poison pill, and issued a statement that it was pleased <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> was putting the issue to a shareholder vote However, the group criticized <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s request for it to extend its offer through June 16 from its current expiration on Friday. Desert Partners said USG provided no assurance that it would refrain from taking other defensive moves during that time. `` The partnership reiterated that it is willing to negotiate all aspects of its offer, including price,'' the statement concluded. Efforts to reach Desert Partners for further comment beyond the statement were unsuccessful and a message was not immediately returned after business hours late Wednesday. USG announced late Wednesday that it would submit the poison-pill question to a special shareholder vote on June 6 if <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> extended its tender offer to June 16. If 85 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> shareholders voted to rescind the poison pill, USG would do so by June 16, stated <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Day, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. `` The <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has previously concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' offer is wholly inadequate, coercive and not in the best interests of USG and its stockholders,'' Day said. `` We believe that by submitting the rights plan to a stockholder vote in a free, non-coercive atmosphere, the stockholder vote will support the board's conclusion,'' he said. Desert Partners, which is controlled by oilmen <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, also is trying to circumvent the poison pill by waging a proxy fight to fill six spots on <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member board of directors at the company's May 11 annual meeting
