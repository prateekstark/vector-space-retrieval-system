<TEXT>
 Activists in the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> towns where the nuclear freeze movement was born are attacking `` Star Wars'' with the tactic they used so well eight years ago: town meetings. So far, residents of 13 communities have voted to order their town clerks to notify President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of their displeasure with the satellite-based missile-killing system also known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. The anti-SDI article failed in two other towns and was tabled in a third, but activists said Monday they were heartened by the results thus far. Fifteen to 20 towns are expected to debate the question in May and June. `` <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> said nuclear technology should be discussed on the village square,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northampton </ORGANIZATION>, who is helping to organize the drive against SDI. `` These town meetings are really the most democratic way of letting the people discuss and decide about nuclear issues,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. She and others in the Coalition to <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 35 area activists, hope to use the town meeting votes to get an anti-SDI question on the statewide referendum in November. In western Massachachusetts, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by better than 3-1, towns have never been shy about their opinions on global matters. The nuclear freeze movement began on the floors of town meetings in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the spring of 1980. It spread to the ballot box that fall, when voters in the four westernmost counties instructed their state senators to favor a resolution asking the president to propose a mutual nuclear weapons moratorium to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> passed a freeze resolution by a 2-1 margin. Anti-war activists have since turned to the town meetings, a 350-year-old institution, to tell the president their thoughts on such matters as nuclear test ban treaties. Anti-war sentiment runs deep in towns such as <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, where residents have voted in town meetings against hostilities involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces since the War of 1812. To get a question on a town meeting warrant, a resident need only collect 10 signatures on a petition. The Coalition to Stop Star Wars went town to town to find sponsors for anti-SDI articles, and held seminars explaining SDI's cost to each community. The 1,502 residents of <LOCATION> Ashfield </LOCATION>, for example, unwittingly contributed an estimated $ 24,990 to `` Star Wars'' in fiscal 1988, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Holroyde </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Traprock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, a non-profit, privately funded group. Since the SDI research project began in 1983, he said, <LOCATION> Ashfield </LOCATION> has contributed $ 91,000. Voters at <LOCATION> Ashfield </LOCATION>'s town meeting approved the anti-SDI article in a voice vote. `` For people who have to fight hard to pay for schools and police and fire departments, it puts the whole thing into perspective,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, a member of the national board of directors of Physicians for Social Responsibility. However, some of that money comes back. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, whose main campus is in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, was the 20th-largest SDI contractor in the nation, according to `` Star Wars: The Economic Fallout,'' by the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities. The book said that that in fiscal 1985 and 1986, the university received $ 1.24 million in SDI contracts. The SDI issue has sparked much heated discussions in town meetings, but rarely have voters questioned why the matter is before them, <PERSON> Holroyde </PERSON> said. `` What we are talking here about is programs we are paying for,'' he said. Only Whately voters rejected the resolution as an inappropriate topic for their town meeting in a 35-28 vote, <PERSON> Holroyde </PERSON> said. At the <LOCATION> Whatley </LOCATION> meeting, resident <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> questioned the arguments of SDI critics. `` You're criticizing the government,'' he told them. `` To me it sounds like propaganda.'' Besides <LOCATION> Ashfield </LOCATION>, the articles were approved by voice vote in the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> towns of <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Shelburne </LOCATION> and were denied by voice vote in <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> voters approved the articles by ballot, hand vote and lineups in <LOCATION> Colrain </LOCATION>, 56-50; <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, 42-13; <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> 59-4; <LOCATION> Shutesbury </LOCATION>, 42-4; and <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> 96-35. In <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the articles passed on voice votes in <LOCATION> Cummington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the articles passed in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, 48-16, and by voice vote in <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were less sensitive to pain after seeing scenes from a war movie, according to a study which gives a glimpse into the complex biology of the disorder. The finding may also be a step toward new treatments, scientists said. `` This may well be getting at some basic core biological aspect of PTSD,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> and colleague <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> did the work with <PERSON> Bessel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> was interviewed before speaking Monday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Post-traumatic stress disorder is estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of people who have survived battle, airplane crashes, earthquakes and other extreme stresses. Often appearing several months or years after the event, the disorder causes sudden memories of the event that can be so vivid that the person thinks he is going through it again. Powerful nightmares, onslaughts of emotions that appear to have no cause, and avoidance of close relationships can also appear. The condition is treated with psychotherapy, and some drugs appear to help. Researchers hope that by understanding biological underpinnings of the disorder they can find more effective medications. Animals exposed to extreme stress, such as inescapable electric shocks, typically lose sensitivity to pain, <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said, because their bodies release natural painkillers called endorphins. When animals are given a substance called naloxone that blocks the action of endorphins, sensitivity to pain returns to normal, he said. The same phenomenon has been reported in humans exposed to electric shocks, he said. The new work involved eight <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans with the disorder and eight combat veterans who did not develop the condition. Researchers applied heat to their forearms and asked them to rank the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 100. The experiment was done at several temperatures and the ratings were averaged. The veterans' pain sensitivity was measured before and after they watched 15 minutes of an ambush scene from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> movie `` Platoon.'' The experiment was done twice. One time the veterans received the endorphin-blocking substance naloxone, and the other time a placebo. Neither the veterans nor the researchers knew which was being administered at the time. Six of the eight veterans with the disorder showed a decrease in pain sensitivity after viewing the ambush scene and getting the placebo. The decrease averaged about 30 percent. Naloxone prevented the decrease in sensitivity, showing it was due to endorphins, <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said. Even with the placebo, no change in pain sensitivity appeared in seven of the eight other veterans. <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said he doubts the endorphins themselves cause symptoms of the disorder, but that their appearance in response to the movie reflects a learned response caused by the severe stress of the original combat experience. The finding is new evidence that the disorder `` does indeed have a complex and unique biological basis,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and chief of the psychiatry service at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt </LOCATION>. It supports the theory that the disorder is associated with biological alterations in the brain's endorphin system, affecting the brain's emotion and arousal centers, he said. In another study reported Monday, researchers found that nine post-traumatic stress disorder patients tended to have a different hormone profile from that of seven depression patients. Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> found the difference by studying each patient's levels of cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone, norepinephrin, testosterone and thyroxin.

 A jury Monday convicted a man accused of being <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> rapist of 14 counts in connection with assaults on six women. The seven-woman, five-man jury convicted <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON>, 27, of five counts of rape, one count of attempted rape, six burglary counts and two counts of theft. District Judge <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufnagel </PERSON> set sentencing for Friday. <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> could be sentenced to a maximum of 350 years. <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON>, who acted as his own attorney throughout the trial, his second, was charged with five rapes and one attempted rape in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood in 1985 and 1986. His first trial ended in a mistrial because of his behavior while acting as his own counsel. District Attorney Norm Early said, `` The jury saw that justice was done. It was a very swift verdict.'' <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON>, who took more than two hours during closing arguments on Friday trying to convince the jury of his innocence, showed no emotion as the verdicts were read Monday. <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> had claimed the victims misidentified him. One woman who testified against <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> in both trials told reporters following the verdict it had been difficult to look him in the face. `` I did n't do it often; but when I was called on, it reaffirmed my conviction he was the man.'' <PERSON> Hufnagel </PERSON> disallowed results of a new DNA test that prosecutors say proved that <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> raped a woman in 1985. The judge said admission of the scientific evidence would not be fair to <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> and could result in a reversal of a conviction. <PERSON> Hufnagel </PERSON> said no appeals court had yet approved DNA testing and only five states, not including <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, accept it.

 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> urged a high-level <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation Monday to end protectionist measures that have forced some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies `` to question the wisdom of pursuing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> made his comments as he greeted Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON> at the start of the sixth meeting of the two governments' joint commission on commerce and trade <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is `` unswervingly pursuing the policy of reform and opening to the outside world,'' as part of its program `` to build a socialist political system with a high degree of democracy ... a system that it is effective and full of vitality.'' During the day, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hosted <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> at a dinner at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the restored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official guest quarters. The vice premier was scheduled to meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> told the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is making progress in reducing trade deficits and asserted that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has recovered from the shock of a wave of imports that swept the country ...'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, meanwhile, over the past year has overcome challenges to its economic reforms and reaffirmed its commitment to reform, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. However, he noted, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at the same time has expanded import controls and raised tariffs. In the past two years, he said, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has restored some confidence in the climate for joint ventures with foreign firms, but still, `` high cost and uncertainty of doing business ... are forcing some -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- companies to question the wisdom of pursuing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recently announced first-stage foreign trade reform is a major step in promoting competition, but he complained that `` trade restrictions appear to have increased ... a significant number of new import barriers have appeared ...'' `` A policy which stresses exports while heavily protecting the domestic market will also lead to increase friction in the bilateral trade relationship'' between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he added. Tian, in a speech released by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries should recognize that there is `` fierce competition'' to sell to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and that he hopes they will become more competitive by improving quality, technical features and terms of trade. He called for `` eventual removal of all undue restrictions'' on selling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-technology products to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not to impose any new controls against import of Chinese textiles, his country's major export. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would work with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to smooth its entry into <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on terms that would bolster <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s efforts to promote open market conditions and competitiveness. The secretary also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to expand transfer of high technology in its <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trade. A basic objective of the three-day commission meeting was to increase that trade, which last year reached a $ 10.4 billion total in both directions. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> indicated the session would air measures to improve the business environment for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms trading with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in such areas as patent and copyright protection, contract and dispute procedures and profitability.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> showed strength among <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats in the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> presidential primaries Tuesday, a good sign for him in November should he win the Democratic nomination. Nearly a quarter of the Democrats voting said they backed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, but about three-quarters of them said this year they would support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could bring home the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. He noted that the finding has been consistent since <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> started asking the question in its <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> exit poll March 29. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll Tuesday said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored one of his best showings of the primary season with white voters in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, winning 24 percent of the white vote. He did better only in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, where he won 32 percent in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll. Still, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won all white subgroups in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and won overwhelming majorities of voters of all groups other than blacks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even made some inroads into the small black vote, winning 32 percent of the black vote in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 11 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Blacks made up 4 percent of the total in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 5 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and the margin of sampling error is high for such a small group in a poll. Among all voters, the error margin was 5 points in the surveys. As in other recent contests, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared acceptable to voters across the spectrum of political ideologies in his party, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. A majority of liberals, a majority of moderates and a plurality of conservatives said his views were `` just right'' as opposed to too liberal or too conservative. `` In a sense, ideologically <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a Rorschach test,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` Voters of different ideologies look at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and are seeing what they want to see. In a sense he's all ideologies to all voters.'' Still, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> noted that a sizeable share of voters _ about 30 percent _ said they did not know enough about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ideological stand to answer the question on ideology. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who appealed to distressed farmers in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> for their votes, ran somewhat more competitively there than in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. About a quarter of the voters said the poor and elderly were a key issue to them, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won that group, 52 percent to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Another quarter said an ability to bring changes was key, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won them 50 to 42, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. The key issue to the most voters in both states was job protection, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won a majority of that group. Most significant for the fall, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> suggested, was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 23 percent of the primary voters told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> they backed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, and 73 percent of them said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 22 percent of the total said they voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, and 78 percent said they would take <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 The leftfielder wore a .38 - caliber pistol on his hip, and the sandlot baseball game was held on the obstacle course of an army But the Jewish settlers, most American emigrants, intently pursued the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pastime on a sunny afternoon in May and saw little strange in the setting. In fact, they viewed their ball game as a symbol of the normalcy of life in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` This could be anywhere in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> on a summer afternoon,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 46, said, surveying the field where about 30 Israelis aged 5 to 50 had gathered to watch and play. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who wore a <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astros </ORGANIZATION> T-shirt, quit a job as a men's wear salesman in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> two years ago to move to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION> nearby, where he opened a pizzeria. `` I guess you could say this is a sign of how normal life is here,'' he said, tossing a softball to his 4-year-old son, <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON>. Maybe so, but <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Zeev </PERSON>, a physician who had jogged over to the field from <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION> to watch his teen-age son play, carried a .357 Magnum on one hip. He said the gun was insurance against being ambushed by Palestinian youths. `` I wear it in case there is a sudden shower of stones. Thank heavens I have n't had to use it yet,'' said <PERSON> Ben-Zeev </PERSON>, who was listening to rock music on a radio-cassette player. He stood along the foul line that led past a large piece of board used to train soldiers to scale walls. The flames of an explosion were painted on the wood in fading red and orange. Settlers maintain that media concentration on five months of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> riots has given a distorted picture of the actual situation in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They say daily life continues largely unaffected for the 65,000 Jewish residents of the occupied territories. While there is no evidence that settlers are leaving their homes in the occupied lands, government and settlement officials agree that the unrest has affected potential residents. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON>, a housing ministry official, said the impact has been greater on the `` commuter settlers'' who live just outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1967 borders and are lured primarily by the chance to live in a house with a yard instead of in an cramped urban apartment. `` There has been some decline in purchases of homes in towns'' near the Israeli border, <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> said. `` But deeper into the territory, where the idealists live, there has n't been a change.'' He estimated that housing sales have declined by a few percentage points, but stressed there has been no mass departures from the area. `` Some perhaps have left the -LRB- large settlements -RRB- for personal reasons, but -LRB- the Palestinian uprising -RRB- has n't been the dominant factor,'' he said. Even before the riots began Dec. 8, the settlement building program had slowed. Since 1984, the government has approved six settlements but people are living in only four. Government spending on settlements, which totaled $ 2 billion between 1968 and 1986, has declined from a 1982-83 peak of $ 250 million a year to $ 150 million at the end of 1986, according to <ORGANIZATION> Meron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benvenisti </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>. The studies by the independent center are funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and Rockefeller foundations. In <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION>, eight miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, town manager <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said the settlement's bulletin board had notices from prospective buyers seeking houses. But he said many of the 300 families who have moved in the hilltop community since 1983 have begun to wonder what will happen as a result of the unrest. `` If it continues, there is no doubt it will affect the idea of people moving here,'' said <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, an immigrant from <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. `` My feeling is that after it calms down the interest in people moving here will resume.'' <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON>, chief rabbi of <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION> and a driving force behind its founding in 1983, said he was pressing ahead with plans to expand the settlement with 450 more houses and a religious education center. `` This was just stones,'' <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON> said, pointing to <LOCATION> Grape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on which is built a cluster of villas with red tile roofs. Rows of houses under construction are going up on nearby <LOCATION> Pomegranate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and more units are planned for <PERSON> Date </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, he said. For <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON>, the attachment to this land is rooted in modern and ancient history and this lure is felt by residents, most of whom are Orthodox Jews. `` The young shepherd boy <PERSON> David </PERSON> raised his flocks here in <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION>, and the book of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> takes place here in the city of <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON>, who emigrated from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At the same time, he maintains there is a national consensus to stay in Gush Etzion, the bloc of settlements that includes <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION>. This stems from the killing of 200 Jewish settlers there in the 1948 war of independence. The unrest, he said, had strengthened settlers' commitment. `` If anything, it has drawn us more closely together,'' <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dairy Group Protests Further Cuts In Milk Price Supports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dairy farmers are being asked to join a lobbying effort by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> to head off a further cut in federal milk price supports scheduled by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> next year. The 72-year-old federation, which represents most of the nation's dairy cooperatives, wants <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> to use authority in the 1985 farm law to cancel the next reduction in milk supports on Jan. 1, 1989, in favor of an alternate plan to cut production. `` Enough is enough,'' federation president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` Dairy farmers are tired of suffering continual price reductions after having done more to address federal policy concerns than any segment of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. agriculture.'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has the authority to set up a new whole-herd buyout or a diversion program, both of which have been used in recent years to trim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk production. However, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has been steadfast against reviving the buyout and diversion programs as an alternative to the reduction in price supports. Camerlo and other federation officials told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that the 50-cent reduction scheduled for next Jan. 1 would put the milk support level at $ 10.10 per 100 pounds of milk, the lowest since 1979. `` Dairy farmers will have to live at 1979 income levels with 1989 costs,'' he said. Milk price supports have been lowered progressively from a record high of $ 13.10 per 100 pounds since 1983 to help discourage surplus production. A diversion plan to pay farmers for cutting back production, and a whole-herd buyout, or Dairy Termination Program, also were used. The 18-month whole-herd buyout program began April 1, 1986, and continued through October 1987. More than 1.22 million dairy cows, heifers and calves were sent to market by thousands of producers who agreed to quit dairying for at least five years. About 38 percent of the buyout program's cost of $ 1.8 billion was paid by dairy farmers themselves who were charged assessments on milk they sold. Similar arrangements helped hold down costs on the earlier diversion plan. <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said the 50-cent reduction next Jan. 1 would come as milk production costs, including feed, are on the upswing. The two-way crunch would add up next year to a 37 percent slide in dairy farm income from 1987 levels. Dairy farmers have contributed $ 2.9 billion in assessments since 1983 to reduce the costs of their programs by 50 percent, overall, <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said. Federation leaders have met frequently with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, in an attempt to persuade them to abandon the path of lower milk supports. `` The secretary has been consistent, as has his staff, that they will cut the price,'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said. `` They do not intend to utilize the authority that they have in the'85 act to implement a whole-herd or Dairy Termination Program.'' <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> stated that policy at the federation's annual meeting in December 1986 and has not budged. `` Another 50-cent cut in the dairy price support level on Jan. 1, 1989, is simply unsound policy,'' he said. `` It will increase, not reduce federal dairy program costs. And it will be as costly _ and perhaps more costly _ to the government than another limited, dairy termination program.'' The previous DTP in 1986-87 was designed to reduce milk production by 12 billion pounds. <PERSON> Camerlo </PERSON> said a limited DTP could be set up to cut production by 4 billion or 5 billion pounds, which would serve as a stopgap measure until new legislation is worked out. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures, milk production in calendar 1987 declined about 1 percent to 142.5 billion pounds from a record of 143.8 billion pounds in 1986. But production is rising again and is expected to gain 1 percent to 3 percent in 1988 to another record level.

 Visitors to national forests may soon find it easier to enjoy the scenery, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Officially, stretches of road selected will be called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Byways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Monday. `` Scenic driving is the single most popular form of outdoor recreation on the national forests,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` Many of the 105,000 miles of roads we have designed and maintained for passenger car travel pass through some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most spectacular scenery.'' Designated byways will have interpretive signs, some overlook and parking areas, and other facilities such as rest stops and short-loop walking trails, he said. `` There are 156 national forests across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and we want to showcase their beauty with these byways,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The agency will seek partnerships with groups and organizations to identify suitable roads and to assist in placing signs, developing interpretive materials and constructing facilities, he said. Some examples of scenic roads that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said could be included in the program: _ <LOCATION> Talimena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scenic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Ouachita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which follows the top of Winding Stair Mountain _ <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scenic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loop </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which runs from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, around <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, and into the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Eldorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which covers 25 miles in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> mountains _ <LOCATION> Kancamagus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scenic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, which covers 32 miles with overlooks that view the Presidential Range

 Farmers idled about 59.9 million acres of cropland under 1987 acreage reduction programs, an area larger than all of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> combined, according to new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. The preliminary report for compliance in the 1987 programs said Monday the acreage represented about 87 percent of the base acreage for wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice. In 1986, by comparison, farmers idled 44.6 million acres, or 82 percent of their total base for those crops. Wheat farmers idled 23.8 million acres last year, followed by corn, 23 million acres; sorghum, 4 million; barley, 2.9 million; oats, 800,000; cotton, 3.8 million; and rice, 1.6 million.

<HEAD>Mondale Urges Dukakis To Use Different Strategy Than His For
Picking Veep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> says the interviews he held four years ago with prospective running mates proved a `` damaged strategy'' and he thinks <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ought to find a different way of selecting the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee this year. Four years ago, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> interviewed a succession of candidates before he chose <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, then a congresswoman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as the first woman on a major party's national ticket. One by one, the vice presidential hopefuls visited <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> at his home in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. In retrospect, `` I do n't think it built confidence,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said of the process. The 1984 Democratic presidential nominee's comments came in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> law office on Monday `` I do n't think the way that process played out reassured Americans,'' he said. `` It's a damaged strategy even though it was not a bad idea.'' He suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` pursue a different way of looking at vice presidential candidates.'' Asked if he thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who now appears likely to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination before the July convention, should choose a Southerner for his running mate, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said, `` I would n't say he has to. But what I ca n't figure out is how you get the numbers if you do n't run strong in the South.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was optimistic about the Democrats' chances of winning a presidential election for only the second time in the last six. `` We've got a shot at this deal,'' he said. Republican Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is a troubled candidate,'' he said. `` I think he gets off in an uncertain way. I think there are going to be vulnerabilities on both sides. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looks strong as a person and I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said there is a need to `` constantly reassure Americans that you possess that special presidential strength of character and independence and resolve to serve the public interest.'' In recent campaign appearances, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> often has seemed to be campaigning against <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, under whom <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> served as vice president. `` I believe that's a sign of weakness,'' said <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. `` Here's a guy who ought to be filling in the blanks where people are worried about him, which is character and vision and direction and presidential status `` Instead, he's out there hacking around against a president who's been out of office for eight years.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> also suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> avoid following his example of declaring that if elected president he would raise taxes to reduce the federal deficit. `` I think it's too bad ... that we ca n't talk about our real problems,'' he said, but `` I think the verdict is in on that.''

 As Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> prepares for a likely fall campaign, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't the only one going after him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the likes of <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> to contend with too. <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON>'s dispute with the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is strictly a local affair. But she _ like other political enemies of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ intends to do what she can to disrupt the governor's presidential bid in order to make her point As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> comes under increasing scrutiny, that task becomes easier and easier. <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> is a member of the board of selectmen in the tiny western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed building a 500-bed prison. She has led the fight against it. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> late last year to tell struggling farmers he was concerned about their plight, <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> went too. `` He would n't acknowledge me, but I was blocking the only entrance to the pigpen,'' <PERSON> Thomas-Vitrac </PERSON> said. `` I think I made my point.'' Former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor who has switched parties, is making his point too. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is bankrolling King's travel around the country criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. King turned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> out of office in 1978; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defeated King in 1982. King made a speech Monday, attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' image as a competent manager. `` I do n't think it's based on facts,'' he said. `` I think it sharply contrasts what he has done.'' A Dukakis presidency, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, would bring `` an ever expanding, more costly government, more regulation, more taxes.'' Another vocal <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opponent is <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the director of the anti-tax group <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>. The group has successfully battled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' efforts in the last five years to create additional exemptions to a voter-passed property tax cap. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> takes credit on the presidential campaign trail for cutting taxes back home in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> fumes. `` He was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` The reputation is a fabricated myth.'' When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> heads to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> later this week to campaign, he likely will be reminded of a policy in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that effectively bans homosexuals from becoming foster parents by encouraging placements of foster children in `` traditional'' families. The Washington-based National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> since last year has organized protests of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> events, and activists and newspapers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s gay community have criticized the policy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a supporter of a gay rights bill languishing before the state legislature, but the foster parent policy has tended to overshadow that. `` He's responsible for a very discriminatory social policy,'' said task force spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics are dominated by Democrats, but not all of them shower praise on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I've always felt that he's spent too much,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've spent all this money and we have n't addressed our major problems, overcrowded prisons, unfunded pension liability and the need for more money to clean up hazardous waste. Flood was quick to add: `` Of course <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a lot of baggage of his own.'' <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, meanwhile, is relishing his job these days. As the top spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> gets a lot of attention when he talks about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said he has been fielding an `` incredible'' number of telephone calls from out-of-state reporters in recent weeks. Not only does <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> take every opportunity to rap the governor _ he calls the thought of a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidency `` scary'' _ he's always willing to steer journalists toward other critics of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> In fact, he has a new card in his desktop Rolodex _ just for numbers of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enemies. `` I made it just for moments like these,'' he said with obvious glee.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held one in a series of meetings with congressional leaders and renewed his demand that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> detail his knowledge of alleged drug trafficking by Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not campaign this week for today's primaries in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He took the weekend off and spent Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> paid visits to both <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> last week, however. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he is still focusing on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the remaining primaries, but his comments about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the meeting with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> were signs he is looking increasingly toward the fall campaign. `` I think that the American people deserve an overall explanation about who in this administration was doing business with him -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- and why,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday. `` I can tell you one thing: If I'm the president we wo n't be doing business with drug-running Panamanian dictators,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he left his Statehouse office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Monday that the vice president was aware before <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment on drug charges in February of speculation that the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government was involved in drug trafficking. But <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said the information was not substantive. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> told reporters that his meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> centered on U.S.-Soviet relations. He said the topic of the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket did not come up during the meeting, adding he was not interested and would be a poor choice anyway. `` That's not in the cards,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said as he left <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' office `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> do n't go well together.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he did not think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of foreign policy experience would hurt him in his expected general election campaign against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although the vice president has already raised the issue. `` Experience is no substitute for ability and he's got real ability,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to defeat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s primary June 7, the same day as the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he and <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> `` had a good discussion.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on Thursday for meetings with congressional leaders including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 Security police raided the headquarters of an underground dissident publishing operation and seized 1,500 copies of a newsletter critical of Communist Party policies, an activist said. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, an underground book publisher and editor of the newsletter known as The Message, said police on Monday seized the publication and printing equipment in a house near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balaton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON> said the publication contained articles from several groups and was timed to coincide with the May 20 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference. `` They are trying to make an example of us,'' <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> apartment, `` but they wo n't succeed in stopping us.'' A growing number of independent non-Communist and activist groups have been calling for more openness and representation in Hungarian society. <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON> said the latest issue of the newsletter contained articles and commentaries on the policies of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A shipment of 402 boxes of Girl Scout cookies will finally reach sailors aboard the USS Midway after being blocked once by Japanese officials and returned to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` That's good news for our sailors and for the Brownies from Troop 807,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday while announcing that the dispute with <PERSON> Japanee </PERSON> customs officials had been resolved. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the cookies should be on their way sometime today now that Japanese officials have relented. Japanese customs officials initially blocked the shipment of cookies from the Brownie troop in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> and assessed a $ 2,000 duty fee, which <ORGANIZATION> Brownie </ORGANIZATION> officials said was too steep for the children. The cookies were shipped April 26, then spent four days in a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> customs warehouse before being returned to the airport in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. Thirty-five servicemen aboard the aircraft carrier had ordered cookies from the Brownies, who had sent the men Christmas cards and a Valentine's Day box of candy. The Midway's home port is <LOCATION> Atsugi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense on his two biggest campaign liabilities, the Iran-Contra affair and alleged drug dealing by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, is the same: a plea of ignorance. On both counts, the Republican presidential candidate sounds alike: _ Although he once headed the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a presidential task force on drugs, he says he did n't know <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in alleged drug trafficking until this past February, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment was handed down in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ Even though a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, he says he had no hint that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms were being sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to free hostages, or that proceeds were funnelled illegally to the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> The vice president's continued denial of advance knowledge in both instances has hung over his campaign like a two-edged sword. Either he knew more than he's admitting, in which case he's not telling the truth; or the candidate who claims vast experience in foreign policy was kept in the dark on two matters of crucial international importance. Either way, it's a no-win political situation for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president has stock ways of dealing with the twin issues. Of Iran-Contra, he says he fully expects Democrats to exploit it as a major campaign issue, but claims that's only because they have little else to talk about. And the political fallout so far has been minimal, he claims. `` It's been tried. It was used against me in the -LRB- GOP -RRB- primaries,'' he told reporters during a campaign stop last week in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` It does n't show up _ unless they -LRB- Democrats -RRB- have got data that I have n't seen _ as a great vulnerability. `` I certainly ca n't say it's a plus,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded. `` But, fortunately neither of them -LRB- Democratic candidates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- has any experience at all in international affairs. So I can offset the criticism by talking about the rest of the world. That's what I've tried to do.'' On <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintains he lacked clear knowledge that the Panamanian general was involved in alleged drug dealings before the indictment three months ago. Campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was aware of rumors of such activity but viewed them as unsubstantiated. `` We heard all sorts of accusations about the government in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` But the question is, when do you get concrete evidence that something of this nature is indeed true?'' As recently as last Thursday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his denial of any advance knowledge of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug dealings. Asked whether he ever had been told of reports of ties between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Not that I was ever aware of.'' Seeking to deflect criticism, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice `` once we found out he had gone bad.'' He also has made an anti-drug theme a major thrust of his race, calling for a Western Hempishere drug `` summit'' and for an international anti-drug force under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. And he has challenged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to show they're as serious as he is by joining him in supporting the death penalty for `` drug kingpins. Thus far, the Democrats have not gone for the bait. Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accuses the Reagan-Bush administration of `` dealing with drug-running Panamanian dictators.'' And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asserts: `` The reason Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not led the charge to fight drugs is because he knew of the administration's dealings with the drug dealers.'' The question of exactly when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged role in drug-dealing was first raised in the Republican primaries by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been hit with the question by reporters at nearly every campaign stop since. The accusations go to the core of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, since he trumpets repeatedly his experience in international affairs _ with a resume that includes serving as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, envoy to the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and heading the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a federal drug-interdiction effort in the early 1980s. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Latin American affairs, has said he would be surprised if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't have advance knowledge of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug trafficking, given his extensive `` If he did n't know, that's almost as disturbing,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> says. But <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Monday: `` The Democrats have nothing to attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on. They ca n't attack him on unemployment, inflation, interest rates; they're all down. Personal income is up. Real wages are up. Taxes are down. There is a new arms-control treaty. So they are going to be looking for issues like this -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and Iran-Contras -RRB- to attack him on.''

 Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has been challenged to back up his criticism of a bipartisan report saying Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> violated White House ethics policy. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., urged <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> in a letter Monday to `` kindly inform us'' of any incorrect information in the 244-page report issued by his subcommittee The report accuses <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> of violating White House ethics policy by helping the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> obtain a $ 32 million no-bid Army contract while he was counselor to the president. Reynolds on Sunday called the report `` sleaze,'' and said the policy went into effect after `` the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> thing was referred over to the attorney general.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report noted that memos sent to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from his longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> seeking help for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> came to then-White House counselor <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in 1982 as well as in 1981. The White House policy barring contact by White House staff with procurement officers about a contract in which a friend has a financial interest took effect in October 1981. In addition to asking <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to back up his criticism of the report, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> pointed out that it was the work of four Republicans as well as five Democrats. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> `` will respond in due course'' to <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s letter. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has acknowledged intervening on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor, in connection with the $ 32 million Army contract. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> subsequently won the no-bid contract. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he merely wanted to assure that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> got a fair hearing.

 Powerful winds ripped through the center of a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town Monday, causing widespread damage and killing one person, while hail storms battered homes and cars in a four-state area southeast of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. A day earlier, as many as 82 tornadoes swept through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, wind gusts blew roofs of downtown buildings, shattered windows and leveled the top floor of a furniture building, officials said. `` It's not just a few shingles, it's entire roofs,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION> Fire Department. `` The buildings we can see -LRB- from fire department building -RRB-, the roofs are gone.'' One person was killed and there were numerous injuries, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> England </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Middlesboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. ` Oh Lord. When I was on the floor, I just saw my life, I just thought I was gone,'' said <PERSON> Lemodee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 20, who is six weeks pregnant. `` Well I've got a bunch of cuts and bruises, but you know, thank God I'm alive. I just thank God I did n't lose it.'' Mayor <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> declared an emergency and was trying to reach the governor's office to ask for help from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Weather officials said they could not immediately determine if a tornado had struck. The city of 11,000 is in southeast <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, bordering on <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A low-pressure system over the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and north of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> produced the tornadoes and threatened to stir up more twisters or thunderstorms Monday in southeast lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and north-central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, forecasters said. `` It was unusual to have so many reports of tornadoes in one day as occurred yesterday,'' <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said Monday. The weather service received 82 reports of tornadoes Sunday in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, but some may be downgraded after further investigation, he said.

<HEAD>Rare Tortoises Breeding, Growing In Stress-Free Captivity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Aldabra tortoises rarely breed in captivity, but three have been born at <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> in the last two months because of its stress-free environment, a breeder says. <PERSON> Zoomer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, born March 31, has almost doubled his 40-gram weight and now weighs 78 grams. His brother, the month-old Hatchback, has increased in weight from 31 grams to nearly 67 grams. <PERSON> Caylith </PERSON>, born last week, weighs 40 grams. The hatching is a rare event in captivity, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> breeder of rare reptiles. The marine park's success can be attributed to a soothing environment where the tortoises do n't have to worry about goats eating them or about being served up as a delicacy, as in their native <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said recently. `` Stress is an important thing with reptiles,'' he said. `` It affects their growth, and it affects their fertility. If wild tortoises are disturbed, they will still lay eggs, but the eggs wo n't be fertile.'' In the wild, tortoises take about 25 to 30 years to reach their adult weight of 500 pounds, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping that by feeding them lots of good vegetable protein, such as cactus, they'll reach their full size in about 15 years,'' he said. `` If we can get them to mature and reproduce faster than they do in the wild, then we will have learned something valuable for tortoise breeders.''

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says that despite the wishes of almost the entire <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, state and local governments are in a better position than the federal government to handle the nation's drunken drivers. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> attended a news conference Monday at which several lawmakers handed the surgeon general a letter signed by 99 senators asking that he declare drunken driving a `` national crisis.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> acknowledged that intoxicated drivers are `` the direct cause of far too many tragedies in our homes and neighborhoods.'' But he said he believed there was little the federal government can do. `` We can talk about things that can be done about it, but unless we have on every level of state and municipal government a tougher policy with those people who are guilty of drunk driving, then we are never going to succeed,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` And the people who can bring that about are the grass-roots people in this country,'' he said. In their letter, the senators wrote that about 24,000 people are killed and 43,000 seriously injured in alcohol-related automobile accidents each year. `` We urge you to focus national attention on this slaughter on our highways by declaring drunk driving to be a ` national crisis,''' the letter said. Such a declaration would have no legal force, but would focus publicity on the problem. The letter was signed at the news conference by 12-year-old <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyette </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, whose father was killed in an accident involving a drunken driver in 1986. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said that on June 15, a member of his staff will begin developing a plan his office can use to support efforts by citizens groups to reduce drunken driving. He declined to say what the initiative would be. When pressed by reporters on whether he would declare the `` national crisis'' requesed by the senators, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think it takes a surgeon general to declare a crisis when everybody knows there is a crisis. He also said he felt `` a little bit put upon by people not in the government to assume responsibilities that are not mine and that I do n't believe I can usurp.'' Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who wrote the letter to <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, both said at the news conference that they were satisfied with what the surgeon general said he would do The only senator who did not sign the letter to <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> is <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., who is recuperating from surgery on an artery that leads to his brain

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Numero </PERSON> will get his <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> law school diploma Sunday, 60 years after a bureaucratic technicality prevented him from joining his classmates at graduation. `` I expected to graduate with my class and get my diploma,'' said the 91-year-old <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> resident, who went on to a successful career in business. `` I even bought a cap and gown, you know.

<HEAD>Rebels Due To Get Cash Instead of Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to send cash payments to <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that will enable them to buy food locally while a dispute over resettlement keeps them from receiving food and other supplies, an administration official says. The payments will range between 50 cents and $ 1 a day for thousands of <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> fighters _ `` enough to keep body and soul together,'' according to the official, who spoke Monday on the condition that he not be identified. A final decision will be made later in the week by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the official said. After the Contras and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government signed a temporary truce on March 23, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 47.9 million humanitarian aid package for the rebels, consistent with a provision in the truce agreement. The legislation permits deliveries of food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies and medical care for children who are war victims. The agreement specified that the rebels receive the aid after resettling in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones. However, no food or other supplies have been sent inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> because a dispute over ground rules within the zones has prevented the resettlement from taking place. This has left some <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> units with acute food shortages. Air drops have been ruled out because of fear that <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> fighters might shoot down the planes used to transport the food. At the time of the truce, there were an estimated 12,000 Contras inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but many have fled into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in search of food. The monthly cost of the payments is expected to be between $ 60,000 to $ 450,000, depending on availability of Contra couriers based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to deliver the cash and the number of rebels inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that can be reached at any given time. Most of the payments will be in cordobas, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s currency. In addition, AID has earmarked more than $ 300,000 per month in family assistance payments to rebels with technical skills. Part of the funds are being assigned to resistance personnel who work at Contra offices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Nicaraguan authorities maintain that any humanitarian assistance sent to the Contras without prior inspection by an officially designated verification commission would be illegal under the truce agreement. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has objected vigorously to an interim program under which U.S.-sponsored aid is being sent by truck or air drop from <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> to Contra camps on the Honduran side of the border. The bulk of this aid _ 262 metric tons _ has been sent by truck, the official said. The administration has denied <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s claims that the shipments have contained lethal equipment, insisting that the deliveries have received prior inspection from Honduran church officials. The cease-fire began on April 1 and is schedued to last for 60 days. During this period, the Sandinistas and the Contras are to negotiate terms for a permanent cease-fire. But little progress has been made in the talks.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has set a June 21 deadline for committees to draft legislation to step up the government's fight against illegal drugs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, denied the move was an election-year ploy, saying he hoped the package would build upon the anti-drug programs <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed two years ago, just before the last election. `` Anything we do that people like'' is denigrated as motivated by election politics, he said on Monday, but that should not deter lawmakers. `` We can not sit by as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> loses the war against drugs,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the legislation to be completed next month would be similar to proposals the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has attached to other legislation, with money for programs such as treatment of addicts, law enforcement and prison construction. `` We'll see how much it takes and then we'll find ways to pay for it,'' he said.

 Foreigners, like Americans, are titillated and amused by revelations in former White House official <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book, but some experts say the out-of-school memoir is more than a laughing matter for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abroad `` There is no doubt that his type of so-called revelations are harmful because ... they give foreigners the impression that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are not to be trusted,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. `` This tends to erode their credibility.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was White House chief of staff until he was forced out in early 1987, reportedly after a feud with first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. His book, `` For the Record,'' depicts President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a passive president loathe to make decisions and manipulated by a wife held hostage to the stars. Books like <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s `` diminish the president's stature, and for the rest of the Western world, so much depends on the president's prestige,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>, longtime <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and now a visiting scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank With a U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> less than a month away, one Soviet scholar said the book _ particularly details of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s penchant for astrology _ provides fodder for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> propaganda machine. Perhaps more damaging, though, is that the revelations may reinforce the perception Soviets have of Americans as a weird, superstitious and somewhat untrustworthy breed, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the author of a just-published book, `` <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and the West: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Politics of Reform.'' The stargazing passages `` confirm a picture of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is a strange and, in many respects, a not totally rational place,'' <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> said. Daily horoscopes are not a regular feature in the Soviet newspapers, as they are in many American and European publications. Soviets have long been concerned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` not a reliable partner'' because of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' failure to ratify the SALT II treaty, among other things, <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book wo n't make it any easier for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to accomplish their goals at the coming summit, he said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> said the administration has lowered expectations about the summit to such a degree that <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book could have little impact. Several people said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s often scornful picture of what goes on behind the gates at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> comes too late in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency to do any real harm to his administration or to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many foreign governments are biding their time until the next president takes office anyway, they say. The Soviet Embassy was closed Monday to celebrate the World War II victory over <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, the chairman of Novisti, the government-controlled press agency, made that point in a recent interview. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is virtually crippled with indecision during an election year because no one knows what the future holds, he said. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> disagreed. `` There is no reason why he ca n't make foreign policy decisions,'' he said. Put in context, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book is not nearly as serious for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy as, for instance, the Iran-Contra affair in which weapons were secretly sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with profits diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels, said <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>. Diplomats at several embassies declined to be quoted by name in talking about the <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> flap for fear of offending the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A few chuckled, but none considered the damage to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> image to be too serious. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> might joke about it on the golf course with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>,'' said an Australian, referring to the secretary of state and the <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> prime minister, respectively. `` It makes you look a bit silly,'' he said. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said books like <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s are `` not helpful in a general sense'' to Americans trying to carry out the administration's policies abroad. At the same time, he said foreigners understand that `` people with a grudge tend to tell their stories.'' While diplomats were cautious, foreign reporters had a heyday with the story. `` People abroad think this is just another giggle,'' said <PERSON> Elgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, who writes for the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. `` It's just one more hilarious thing about the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, is n't it?'' Europeans have often mocked the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> for their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tastes and their `` glizerati friends at the White House,'' she said. `` What are we going to do for kicks if kiss-and-tell books are ever barred?''

 The gang film `` Colors'' was the box office winner last weekend despite a sluggish period that saw moviemakers preparing for the Memorial Day holiday blockbuster blitz. Moviegoing traditionally slows down in the weeks before Memorial Day and `` business was flat'' last week, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which surveys box office revenues. `` This is one of the slowest periods of the year. Everything is standing neutral until the blockbusters come at the end of the month,'' said <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>. Booming attendance is anticipated with the release later this month of the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas-Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> film `` Willow'' and two sequels, `` Rambo III'' and `` Crocodile Dundee II.'' Meanwhile, ghosts and cops were the themes for five of the weekend's top six films. `` Colors,'' with <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> as a cocky rookie cop teamed with the savvy veteran <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, took in $ 4 million in its fourth week of release. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s role as an exorcist in the hereafter comedy `` Beetlejuice'' was second with a $ 3.3 million take. `` Shakedown,'' featuring <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> as an undercover cop helping to expose corrupt colleagues, was third with $ 3 million and `` Salsa,'' a torrid romance throbbing to a Latin beat, was fourth with $ 2.6 million. `` Dead Heat,'' a story about a policeman killed in the line of duty then brought back to life for 12 hours to find his killer, rang in $ 1.6 million to place fifth and `` Above the Law,'' featuring a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cop's drug-ring battle, was sixth with $ 1.44 million. `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> as an Army private, took in $ 1.4 million to place seventh. `` The Last Emperor,'' <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s epic that won nine Academy Awards, with eighth with $ 1.2 million. The teen-oriented film `` Casual Sex?'' was ninth with $ 1.18 million and rounding out the top 10 was `` Moonstruck,'' which took in $ 1.1 million. Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in release, and estimated production costs when available. 1. `` Colors,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4 million, 1,386 screens, $ 2,891 per screen, $ 25 million, four weeks, $ 12 million. 2. `` Beetlejuice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3.35 million, 1,569 screens, $ 2,104 per screen, $ 51.22 million, six weeks, $ 20 million. 3. `` Shakedown,'' Universal, $ 3.01 million, 1,580 screens, $ 1,910 per screen, $ 3.01 million, one week, n-a. 4. `` Salsa,'' Cannon, $ 2.62 million, 1,125 screens, $ 2,335 per screen, $ 2.62 million, one week, n-a. 5. `` Dead Heat,'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.66 million, 1,012 screens, $ 1,647 per screen, $ 1.66 million, one week, n-a. 6. `` Above the Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.44 million, 822 screens, $ 1,761 per screen, $ 13.97 million, five weeks, $ 14 million. 7. `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' Universal, $ 1.4 million, 1,009 screens, $ 1,390 per screen, $ 36.1 million, seven weeks, $ 16 million. 8. `` The Last Emperor,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.25 million, 817 screens, $ 1,557 per screen, $ 37.41 million, 25 weeks, $ 25 million. 9. `` Casual Sex?,'' Universal, $ 1.18 million, 900 screens, $ 1,315 per screen, $ 9.23 million, three weeks, $ 9 million. 10. `` Moonstruck,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.17 million, 830 screens, $ 1,419 per screen, $ 70.79 million, 21 weeks, $ 17 million.

 A <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple says relatives thought they had gone off the deep end when they began commuting 625 miles to weekend jobs at the Opryland <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> amusement park. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Twila </PERSON> <PERSON> Uzmack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, leave their home every Friday morning and drive to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, where they work in an Opryland information booth on Saturdays. `` Some people think we're crazy, but we really love it here,'' <PERSON> Uzmack </PERSON>, a 62-year-old retired education, said recently. The Uzmacks have been dividing their time between <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for eight years. <PERSON> Uzmack </PERSON> saw an Opryland help-wanted ad a few years ago and suggested to his wife that they apply. `` I told him they would n't hire people our age, but within 15 minutes we were hired,'' said 58-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Uzmack </PERSON>, who taught elementary school for 25 years. `` We told them we wanted to meet people so they placed us in the information booth.'' Last year, the couple stayed at their <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> retirement home. But a few months ago, <PERSON> Uzmack </PERSON> was asked to act as temporary superintendent of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> school district. `` That is one of the reasons we are commuting this year,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Uzmack </PERSON> said the drive `` is n't bad. We enjoy it. It's a break and gives us something different to do, but occasionally we fly.''

<HEAD>Marriage Poll Shows Most Would Remarry Spouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only 7 percent of married women surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> say they would n't marry their mate again. The poll of 608 women released Monday found that 88 percent would wed the same man again. The rest were undecided. Their husband's sense of humor was cited as the reason for falling in love by 49 percent of women surveyed while 39 percent said they decided to marry him because `` he shared my vision of the future.'' The most common reason given for opposing the idea of remarrying the same man was that the couple had nothing in common, according to the poll published in the June issue. The magazine said this complaint was most often heard from readers ages 45 to 59. Other problems cited as interfering with marital bliss included communication problems, a lack of emotional responsiveness and opposition to a spouse's independence. The magazine said the last complaint was most often made by women younger than age 30. A particular protest of <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> women who said they would not remarry their husbands was, `` he's boring.'' The Roper organization conducted the poll for the magazine with telephone and street interviews. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>American Hostage Thought Freedom Was Near</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest held Western hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was convinced a week ago that he would soon be released. Instead, diplomat <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and two other Frenchmen were freed. `` I am very sad, because I spent the last six months with <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> told <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, during a meeting Monday at his home outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> thought he would be let out before me. And I told <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> to tell my family what I am telling you now.'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors Wednesday along with fellow diplomat <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>. The three returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Thursday after nearly three years in captivity. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and one of nine Americans missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was abducted March 16, 1985, in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` They -LRB- the captors -RRB- said either <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will be out first or <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> will be out first,'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. On May 3, a guard told <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to prepare his things, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. `` At midnight, they took <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> away and I stayed alone in the room. At two in the morning, somebody came and asked me if I knew. I said no. He said: ` Well, you'll be free this morning at 7 o'clock.''' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, looking thin and pale, said he felt fine. He told of his experiences in the living room of his home with his wife and three sons. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said the greatest fear he and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had was that their governments would attempt a rescue raid. `` When somebody knocked on the door, two guards immediately stepped in, pointed guns at us and waited for whoever was going to come in. There is no chance that any commandos would ever get in without us being killed.'' Another fear was falling ill. `` We had no right to see a doctor,'' he said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> does not know that his father and brother have died. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said he himself knew, because he had heard it earlier on the radio, but he did n't tell his cellmate because he did not want him to be depressed. `` For <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, his father is still alive.'' Once last year, in a fit of frustration, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> beat his head against the wall until the blood flowed down his face. `` I could n't stop him because he is strong. I called the jailers who were stronger. I told <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> to think of your wife and think of your family.'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said none of the hostages received letters. They were not allowed to read newspapers or listen to the news on television or radio. They did, however, watch the Miss USA pageant on television, he said. `` Mentally, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has no problems. We watched the women on television. We were always laughing about it. We saw the Miss USA pageant. It was Miss Texas who won. He voted for Miss <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and me for Miss <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would survive. `` He's very courageous. The last time, when I was a little sick and dispirited, I said to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> that I'm not afraid to die, but I do n't want to die here and have them throw my body into the sea like they did with -LRB- hostage <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said: ` I do n't want to die anywhere.'''

 A judge denied a defense motion for a mistrial Monday even though a prospective juror said his mind was made up in the trial of a man accused of killing 16 people, including 14 family members. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, is on trial for murder in two Dec. 28 shootings in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. He still must face trial on the Christmas season slayings of his relatives at his home near <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. A dozen jurors and two alternates were seated Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Opening statements were scheduled to begin Tuesday. Prosecuting attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said the state's first witness would be <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, to whom <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered after the <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> shootings. As jury selection began, potential juror <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> of Ozark told Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, in front of about 100 other prospective jurors: `` I know too much. I've been working down around <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> a little bit. I've got my mind already made up.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said potential jurors would be asked later about what they had heard about the case. `` I've not heard about it,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. `` I've been down there with the people.'' While <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> was telling <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> to stop talking, defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> was objecting and making motions to quash the panel of prospective jurors and to declare a mistrial. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> denied the motions, saying no harm had been done. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is charged with two counts of capital murder in the deaths of former co-worker <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, who officials say spurned his advances a year before she was killed, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, who police say was a chance victim during a 45-minute shooting spree. If convicted of either count, the sentence is life without parole or death. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> also faced five counts of attempted murder and one count of kidnapping in the trial. The defense asked <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> to dismiss those counts, but he refused. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> set a July 18 trial for <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> on capital murder charges in the deaths of 14 family members. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was arrested Dec. 28 after deputies found two of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' children and their spouses shot to death and an 11-year-old granddaughter strangled. The next day, police dug into a shallow, kerosene-soaked grave and found seven bodies, including those of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' other children and his wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>. Police also found the bodies of two infant boys in garbage sacks in the trunks of abandoned cars on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' property. The babies were strangled. Jury selection proceeded in a room apart from the courtroom. Potential jurors were summoned one at a time and questioned individually. At times, as many as 10 policemen were in the second-floor courtroom in the two-story <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse. Cameras are allowed in the courtroom only during recesses, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> decided. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> excused nine potential jurors for cause, generally because they said they had concluded due to pretrial publicity that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was guilty. The state excused seven prospective jurors and the defense only one.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf War Good Business For Ship Repair Yards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> repair yard that serviced two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels damaged as a result of the Iran-Iraq war said it made a profit for the first time last year. The Arab Shipbuilding and <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual report that 1987 was its best year since it opened a decade ago in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The drydock in neighboring <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, the largest repair facility in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, reported earlier that its business also has increased. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which have waged war for 7 -LCB- years, in the last year have intensified their attacks on gulf shipping. The Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard's annual report, distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, gave no detailed breakdown of its profits. But two major operations undertaken last year included repairing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark, which was badly damaged May 17 in an Iraqi air strike that killed 37 sailors. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the attack was launched when a fighter-bomber pilot mistook the frigate for an Iranian warship. The other repair operation was on the American-owned supertanker <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carribean </ORGANIZATION>, which was damaged just outside the gulf in August by a mine believed planted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khateeb </PERSON>, secretary of the yard's board of directors, earlier told the gulf magazine Arab Ad that the company earned $ 22 million last year compared to $ 11.3 million in 1986, `` thanks to two major contracts.'' The magazine said the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carribean </ORGANIZATION> was one, but did not name the Stark. It did not specify how many of those vessels were casualties of the so-called `` tanker war'' between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Coupled with a worldwide shipping recession over recent years, shipping experts said the war has scared off an estimated 40 percent of the vessels that once used the waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s gulf ports also have been closed since the early days of the conflict. The Arab Shipbuilding and <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> was set up in 1978 by seven of the 10 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries: <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. About 500 merchant ships in the gulf have been hit in air and sea attacks as well as mines since early 1984. The USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship to suffer serious damage in the gulf, was taken to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> for repairs after it was damaged by a mine last month.

 The government today signed a peace accord with a Sinhalese extremist group to end a terrorist campaign that has taken at least 260 lives, officials announced. <PERSON> Lalith </PERSON> <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s national security minister, told a news conference that the agreement calls for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to give up their arms and cease guerrilla attacks. In exchange, he said, the government agreed to lift its ban on the front and release all of the group's members from detention except those charged with murder or attempted murder. The agreement was signed by <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rohanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, leader of the group, at an undisclosed location. Front members are to surrender all arms by May 29 at four <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples, <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON> said. Insurgency activities were to end immediately, he said. The front has been blamed for killing 260 politicians, soldiers and government officials since July. The Peoples' <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> launched its campaign to show opposition to a peace accord signed July 29 to try to end the minority Tamils' separatist campaign in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The front contended that the pact made too many concessions to the Tamils. Tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland, claiming they are discriminated against by the island's majority Sinhalese. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million population. The Sinhalese, who are Buddhists, comprise about 75 percent. The rest are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> descendants of Western colonalists or Moslem descendants of early Arab traders. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has an estimated 60 million ethnic Tamils in its southern states, brokered the July accord, which calls for the Sri Lankan Tamils to lay down their arms in exchange for new regional councils that will give them some say in local government activities. But the largest of the rebel groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to put down the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' rebellion. The Peoples' <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has a long history of anti-government activities. It was outlawed after an abortive 1971 effort to overthrow the Sri Lankan government, but it began regrouping in 1986 and 1987. Initially a radical Marxist group, it became the underground champion of the island's majority Sinhalese. The group has been blamed for two recent attacks on Sri Lankan military installations and the assassinations of several candidates for recently held local elections in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>.

 A woman was found guilty of killing her husband and a woman to collect more than $ 175,000 in insurance, and the prosecutor says the conviction in the nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial will stop drug tamperers. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of suburban <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted Monday of all five counts in the deaths of her 52-year-old husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, also of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Federal court jurors, who deliberated nearly five days, said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter's testimony against her mother proved crucial. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, scheduled for sentencing June 17, could receive life in prison. Prosecutors also are considering state murder charges. `` It was all there for -LRB- jurors -RRB- to make this decision,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said, adding that the verdict will `` be a deterrent'' to would-be drug tamperers. Jury foreman <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 55, said the panel was split 11-1 in favor of conviction through its first three votes. The testimony of <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s 28-year-old daughter, was decisive. `` I think without <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>'s testimony there were, you might say, too many missing links in the chain of evidence,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> testified her mother discussed killing <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> by a drug overdose or by hiring a hit man. Although prosecutors were unable to link Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> directly to cyanide purchases, she was convicted of all five counts she faced, two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce and three of tampering. Beset by financial problems and unhappy in her marriage, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules with cyanide and gave them to her husband for a headache, prosecutors said. To make his death appear random, she poisoned other bottles of Excedrin and Anacin capsules and put them on store shelves. Ms. Snow died after swallowing capsules from one of those bottles, six days after <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, the prosecution said. Her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Webking </PERSON>, said she might still be alive if local authorities had recognized the real cause of <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s death, initially attributed to emphysema. `` The effect of the verdict is secondary to the fact that Sue is dead,'' Webking said. `` No matter what the verdict is, Sue's going to be dead.'' `` I wish they'd hang her to the highest tree,'' said Ms. Snow's mother, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Artesia </LOCATION>, N.M. King County Prosecutor <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleng </PERSON> said he would wait until after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges The deaths of <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> and Ms. Snow touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its capsuled, non-prescription medicines. `` Product tampering is intolerable to society,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, spokesman for New York-based Bristol-Myers, said. `` When it occurs every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to bring them to justice,'' he said. Seven people died in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1982 from cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> accused Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> of poisoning her husband to collect on his life insurance. Public defender <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was the victim of a lying daughter who stood to gain a $ 300,000 reward from pharmaceutical companies for information leading to an arrest. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s plan failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules, greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted bottles of painkillers recovered, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said in closing arguments. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, a tropical fish enthusiast, used a bowl contaminated with an algaeicide for cleaning fish tanks when she mixed potassium cyanide with the Anacin and Excedrin painkillers, the prosecution alleged. Traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also lied about insurance policies and pressed medical authorities for a more specific cause of death, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> stood to receive $ 71,000 in insurance if the death of her husband was from emphysema, as pathologists first concluded, but could have gotten $ 176,000 if the death were ruled accidental, the prosecutor said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also left fingerprints on library books about poisons and cyanide, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>, who spent a half century writing about man's relation to technology, society and the universe, was remembered upon his death at age 80 as science fiction's prolific `` grand master.'' `` He was probably the best of us all at his peak,'' <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON>, one of the top science fiction writers, said Monday. `` He forged the route the rest of us followed. `` His early stories in the 1940s were so far ahead of everything else being done that he made an enduring name for himself as the best science fiction writer.'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>, whose books explored the future while questioning the morals and beliefs of the present, died of heart failure Sunday at his home in this seaside community 130 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> suffered for years from emphysema and had undergone numerous operations, including one to relieve restricted blood flow to his brain. <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>, a former aviation engineer, dreamed up the water bed in his 1961 classic `` Stranger in a Strange Land,'' and envisioned an atomic power plant years before the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project. The current issue of Books in Print lists 64 books written by <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>. More than 40 million copies of his writings have been sold. He won the Nebula award from the Science Fiction Writers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1975; and an unprecedented four Hugo awards, in 1956 for `` Double Star,'' in 1959 for `` Starship Troopers,'' in 1961 for `` Stranger'' and in 1966 for `` The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.'' His other works include `` The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' `` The Man Who Sold the Moon,'' `` Have Space Suit Will Travel,'' and `` Puppet Masters.'' `` <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> wrote about worlds that people believed in,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON>, a science fiction writer-publisher reached at a convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` He made them seem real and solid, real lived-in worlds. His early work was quite extraordinary that way.'' <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, in 1907. He graduated from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and served for five years, including aboard the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION>, but was forced to retire because of ill health. He moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, unsuccessfully ran for the state legislature and wrote his first story, `` Lifeline,'' selling it for $ 70 to Astounding Magazine. <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> served together in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> during World War II and `` formed a close friendship which never entirely broke up.'' `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> has been writing science fiction now for 48 years and from the very start he was recognized as a grand master,'' recalled <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON>. `` In 1975 the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> set up just such an award, and he was the first to get it. `` There was no argument, much like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> becoming the first president.'' <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said his favorite bit of <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> writing was the opening to `` Door Into Summer,'' a story about time travel in which `` he described a cat better than anyone has ever described a cat. `` The work that impressed me the most was ` Solution Unsatisfactory,' written before the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project, in which he accurately described the current nuclear stalemate,'' <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON>'s books were written in a spare, matter-of-fact style, but they presented readers with thoughtful questions about how life should be lived. In the classic `` Stranger in a Strange Land,'' hero <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is a human raised by Martians. But he challenged his home planet's values with his own priorities, including universal free love, nudity and many sexual encounters. He also `` discorporated'' or made disappear authority figures he felt were evil. In `` Methuselah's Children'' and in later books, character <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> offers this aphorism on how to get a man to help you: `` Never appeal to a man's better nature. He may not have one. Invoking his self-interest gives you more leverage.'' In addition to the water bed, another <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> invention in common use is known as a `` waldo,'' for the handicapped hero of the short story of that title. <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON> invented remote-controlled robot arms that are used in a variety of delicate and hazardous manufacturing processes. Two years ago, he told writer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> that `` writers do n't know how to retire'' and said he stuck with science fiction because he did it well and because it sold <PERSON> Heinlein </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. They had no children.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar lost ground in trading against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stock prices posted a moderate gain to end a decline that lasted three consecutive trading days. The dollar closed at 124.63 yen, down 0.24 yen from its finish of 124.87 yen on Monday. It had opened the day at 124.78 yen and ranged narrowly throughout the day between 124.55 and 124.79 yen. `` Trading was lusterless without any market incentives,'' said an official of a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. The market probably will remain quiet until the announcement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> May 17 of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for March, the official said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a big 223.47-point loser Monday, won back 147.95 points, or 0.53 percent, finishing the day at 27,412.25. The main stock market barometer had lost a total of 405.42 points during the last three trading days.

Popular issues included oils, steels, machineries and heavy electricals. Among the losers were drugs and glass makers. Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares, up from 600 million shares Monday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners 495 to 401, while 176 isues were unchanged.

 Republican voters decide two hard-fought primary battles today, as <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> seeks to deny Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> a shot at election and millionaire <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> tries to derail <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s bid for a record fourth term. Also in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> faces a little-known opponent as he seeks the Democratic nomination for a sixth term. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary has become a bitter and divisive contest _ as well as a close one. An <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll last week showed <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> backed by 41 percent of those interviewed, while <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> was supported by 40 percent. Nineteen percent were undecided, and the margin of error was 4 points. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, a 47-year-old four-term congressman, has accused <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> of being a `` rubber stamp'' for Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and of `` flip-flopping'' on votes, including the trade bill and last year's highway bill. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, 39, was a key supporter of Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s 1986 election campaign but otherwise a political unknown when she appointed him in March 1987 to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>. The last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator defeated in a primary was <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, who lost in a runoff Oct. 7, 1980, to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> was defeated that November by Republican <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary, the overwhelming favorite is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, the popular 44-year-old former governor. He faces <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON>, a 45-year-old disbarred lawyer. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> must overcome a well-financed campaign by <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> as well as a last-minute televised report linking him to corruption in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> report broadcast Sunday quoted former county political boss <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> as saying that in 1972 <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> offered him $ 12,000 to include his name on a list of recommended candidates when <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was running for his second term as governor. A <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> spokesman called the report `` a piece of garbage,'' and <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said he was `` saddened by the whole event.'' <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, 38, maintains the state is in perilous financial shape, and claims <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> made just 10 percent of $ 385 million in budget cuts recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Waste Management. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 65, has taken credit for cutting taxes by $ 311 million during the past four years, although he fought most of the cuts when they were imposed by the Legislature. He also says he has brought new businesses and 30,000 jobs to the state, although the total number of working West Virginians has increased by just 5,700 since <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, who inherited much of his wealth, has a reputation as a `` rich kid'' who loves fast boats and hard living. He lost to another millionaire, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, in his first try for office in the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. The last governor to lose a primary was <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Democrat, who finished second in a non-partisan `` open primary'' last October to fellow Democrat <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Instead of forcing a runoff, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> withdrew from the race. In 1986, Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheffield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> lost the Democratic primary to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, who won the election in November.

<HEAD>Danes Vote In Election Focusing On NATO Commitment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> voted today in a parliamentary election seen as a referendum on <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Polls opened at 9 a.m. for the 3.9 million eligible voters and close 11 hours later. Reliable projections of the results were expected at 10 p.m. Three independent surveys predicted little change from the results of the previous election last September, with modest gains possible for a rightist fringe group. It was the first election since World War II to be contested over foreign policy or security issues. The Danes have voted 19 times in 43 years, a European record. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, heading a center-right coalition, called for the vote after he failed to block a motion in parliament last month toughening <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear stance `` This election is a referendum on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said in a newspaper interview on Monday. The snap election comes just eight months after <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> suffered setbacks in a previous ballot. If implemented, the resolution would require notification be sent to visiting warships of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s 31-year-old peacetime ban on nuclear weapons in its territory. Until now <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has been satisfied with a general policy statement. The resolution was seen as a challenge to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of keeping a nuclear option. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British ships, as a matter of policy, refuse to say whether they are nuclear armed. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has said a Danish policy shift could affect <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s capability for emergency reinforcement of this strategic country which controls access to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> The Social Democrats, who sponsored the resolution, deny they are anti-NATO, but say <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> can not be intimidated by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear powers into compromising on its anti-nuclear policy Twelve parties are in the race for the 179-member Folketing, but a party must surpass a 2 percent threshhold to win a seat in the legislature. Nine parties are in the current house. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s four-party coalition controls 70 seats. The opposition alliance of Social Democrats and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has 81 seats The balance of power is held by the <ORGANIZATION> Social-Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with 11 seats, which backs the government's domestic policy and supports the opposition's foreign policy. Pre-election polls forecast another stalemate, with only the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> showing gains from the nine seats it now holds. The party advocates deep tax cuts, less bureaucracy and restricting immigration, and it is shunned by all the mainstream politicians. Also in the outgoing parliament are the four-seat leftist fringe party, Common Course, and four representatives from the autonomous territories of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Faroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said he expected a long period of post-election haggling to form a workable coaltion, and that he hoped for a broad alliance that would command a majority in parliament. He did not rule out a partnership with the Social Democrats, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s largest party.

 <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, whose sexual encounter with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to the TV preacher's downfall, says she answered grand jury questions about her former <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> pastor. `` It seems like this will never end,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> told reporters after testifying before the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury for about an hour Monday. `` I will never regret, however, growing up in the church.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> McGurt </PERSON>, a spokesman for state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, said the investigation `` is related to the earlier grand jury proceedings in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>.'' Those proceedings reportedly centered on Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s former boss, the Rev. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in <LOCATION> Massapequa </LOCATION>, and whether his church violated state tax laws. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said the questions she was asked `` were very predictable with a few surprises.'' She said because she was sworn to secrecy she could not elaborate. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> declined to confirm if <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> was the target of the investigation but acknowledged that she was asked about him. `` Naturally, I would be. I worked with the man almost all my life,'' she said. In October, Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a statement following her testimony before the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> grand jury that she `` turned to Reverend <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON> for comfort and support'' after her sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in 1980. She later became secretary to the church headed by <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>, her pastor since she was 14. <PERSON> Profeta </PERSON>'s church turned out to be `` a world just as disturbed as that of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> ... and the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to her statement. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the financially troubled television ministry in March 1987 after disclosures of the sexual encounter her. Earlier Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> told reporters that her life has been threatened repeatedly and that `` very important papers'' were stolen from her <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> apartment during the past year. `` A lot of important things are missing,'' she said. `` The entire story from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> on.'' Her attorney, <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> lost `` documents, agreements, canceled checks, contracts.'' Neither he nor Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> elaborated about the theft. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who appeared topless in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine last year and sold the magazine her account of the 1980 encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, has been living in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mansion. `` I see myself as someone who has always been in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, getting into a limousine with her lawyer.

 Despite misgivings among officials about honoring a Nazi airship, a historical marker now designates the spot where the <PERSON> Hindenburg </PERSON> exploded and crashed 51 years ago, killing 36 people. `` There was some political hesitancy,'' <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Freeholder <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckwald </PERSON> said after Monday's dedication. `` But we felt it was time to forget the politics and view it as an historic occasion.'' Several hundred people gathered for a ceremony last year marking the 50th anniversary of the crash. The freeholders _ county supervisors _ paid for a marker at the site, a field at what is now the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The plaque was to be dedicated Friday, the 51st anniversary of the May 6, 1937, tragedy. But the service was postponed by rain until Monday, the 52nd anniversary of the Hindenburg's first flight into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bronze marker, set in pink granite, is surrounded by a concrete walkway in an elliptical shape similar to the Hindenburg's outline Several dozen people attended the dedication ceremony. `` It's a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tradition that when we make a ship a memorial, we put a plaque on the bridge,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON>, commanding officer at the engineering center. `` In this spot is where the bridge, or the control car, on the Hindenburg came to rest. `` They should have done this a long time ago,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannaccone </PERSON>, who was in the Hindenburg's ground crew on the fateful day. `` Everybody who comes here wants to know where it happened. Now they can see where it happened.'' <PERSON> Iannaccone </PERSON> and several others at the dedication brought small pieces of the 804-foot Hindenburg's charred aluminum alloy frame. The <PERSON> Hindenburg </PERSON> was filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead of fire-proof helium, a rare commodity that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would not willingly share with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Investigations indicated the probable cause of the explosion was a hydrogen leak in the aft part of the ship, complicated by thunderstorms and static discharge from the landing lines dragging on the ground below. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Grand </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said final details have not been worked out on allowing the public onto the secured base to see the memorial.

<TEXT>
 Ten representatives of the Nicaraguan rebels met along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border to try to iron out divisions within their organization, a rebel spokesman said. The meeting involved unidentified civilian and military members of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the principal rebel umbrella organization, who were `` interested in bringing about the cohesion of our forces,'' said <PERSON> Boscos </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a Resistance spokesman. In a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said none of the Resistance directors participated in the meeting. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> also denied published reports that a group of Contras, as the U.S.-backed rebels are known, have been holed up in a Honduran base camp since Saturday and were refusing to take orders from the Resistance leadership. A report in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that between 1,500 and 3,000 rebels were mounting a rebellion at a base camp in <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, a tiny Honduran village about three miles from the Nicaraguan border. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the reported rebellion was being led by <PERSON> Diogenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Membreno </PERSON>, a Contra military commander. `` There is no rebellion. Everything that says there is -LRB- one -RRB- is false,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. `` There are only differences in criteria, as occurs in any democratic movement.'' In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, a Contra official closely tied to the Resistance directorate also denied there had been an uprising. `` We can not deny that there have been problems in our ranks, but it is my understanding that the situation is under control and that all combatants are willing to obey the established authorities,'' the source told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition that he not be identified. He confirmed there were about 3,000 rebel guerrillas in <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> declined to comment on the results of Sunday's meeting, which he said lasted over two hours He did say that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Membreno </PERSON> was at the session. `` We are acting in a democratic manner in which there always are differences of opinion,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. `` Nevertheless, the situation will be resolved very soon.'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said none of those at the meeting was opposed to the March 23 cease-fire plan signed by Contra leaders and representatives of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista goverment. The Contra official in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, however, said there is `` discontent among a group of our combatants who do not agree with the accords ... and this has created the crisis that exists at the moment.'' Seven high-level Contras were expelled from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Friday after demanding the firing of their chief, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who reportedly opposes the peace agreement. They accused <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> of corruption and of surrounding himself with supporters of the late Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON>, who was ousted when a popular revolution brought the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to power in 1979. The Contra source confirmed <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Membreno </PERSON> was among those seeking <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s ouster. He said the infighting over <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s role had seriously divided the Resistance directorate as well, with `` one axis formed by <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> who support <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, and another axis formed by <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'' who want to replace the colonel. The source said that <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and the directorate members were summoned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, where Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged them to settle their differences. As a result of that meeting, the source said, the directorate members `` are seriously talking to resolve their differences over the military and political leadership of our forces.''

<TEXT>
 An escaped killer who eluded authorities for five weeks, living in the rugged hills in a lean-to and eating groundhog, was captured when his sprint to flee searchers was slowed by a dog he'd befriended. <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, 45, who was serving a life term for the 1973 robbery and murder of a grocer, was caught Monday following a two-hour chase that one officer likened to a deer chase. <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> was the last to be recaptured of three murderers who escaped April 3 from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>. He was trapped on a remote, heavily wooded ridge about 25 miles from the prison, state police said. Police said <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> relied on his outdoors savvy to remain free five weeks, but he also befriended a dog, and the pet slowed him down during Monday's chase. `` He had the dog tied up'' on a makeshift leash of string and led it along while running, but <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> finally released the beagle when it had trouble keeping up, said Trooper S.P. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. `` The dog followed him and was with him when we caught him,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. Local police, state conservation officers and authorities with tracking dogs chased <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> up one thickly wooded ridge and down another. The escapee carried a dismantled .22 caliber rifle in a garbage bag but ditched it during the pursuit, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. `` Finally we got him coralled in there and he jumped up in front of a local police officer,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. `` He gave himself up. I think mostly he was tired. `` We almost would have lost him again if he had headed up another ridge,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. `` He said he knew that, but lost his bearings.'' <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> had been seen in the area before but had evaded searchers. A resident reported seeing <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> Sunday night, and about six troopers searched the woods until 1:30 a.m. before going home. `` Then we got another call this morning and were looking in the woods for only five to 10 minutes when he bolted up the hill. The chase was on,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> weighed about 230 pounds when he escaped from prison but lost between 45 and 65 pounds while free, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. He had to eat groundhog and lived in a lean-to, police said. Aside from being tired after the strenuous chase, however, <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> appeared to be in good shape, the trooper said. `` He's got some scratches, but that's it. You would n't think there was anything wrong with him the way he ran up that hill this morning,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. `` A regular guy could n't have done it.'' <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> faces administrative escape charges, but <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said criminal escape charges likely would be dropped. `` He's already serving life. What more could we do?'' Penitentiary officials described <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON> as the mastermind of the April escape by the three murderers, all of whom were serving life sentences without chance of parole. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, 35, was arrested April 14 in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, at the apartment of a friend, where he was hiding in a closet. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> had been convicted of killing a <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> police officer. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 28, was caught late last month in <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where he was riding in a pickup truck with his brother. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was convicted of murder and other charges in the December 1980 slaying of a Marytown resident.

<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s wife must stay away from her husband for six hours a day to let him rest and to allow nurses to care for him, a judge has ordered. The judge's temporary order Monday specified that male nurses be hired because of <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s apparent jealousy of female nurses. `` I'm not convinced that you are such a danger that you have to be restricted altogether,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> during one of her rare calm moments during the hearing. The lawyer for the 86-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> director, who has been ruled incompetent to manage his own affairs, is trying to bar Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> from their apartment. The hearing will continue next Monday. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldhamer </PERSON>, charges that <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, who has a history of mental problems, has abused her husband verbally and physically. He asked the judge to annul the Bings' marriage, claiming his client suffers from Alzheimer's disease and did n't know what he was doing when he married her last year. Mrs. <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON>'s order requires the 48-year-old Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> to stay away from her husband from 10 a.m. until noon for his nutrition and hygiene needs, from 3:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. so he can nap, and from 9 p.m. until 10 p.m.. After 10 p.m., she may stay with <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> until 10 a.m. the next day, the judge ruled, and if <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> must see a doctor, his wife may not accompany him Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> frequently disrupted the hearing, which started Thursday. On Monday, nurse <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> testified that when she tried to keep an eye on <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> one day Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> screamed at her, `` Go away! We do n't need you!'' <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> then `` bundled him onto a bus,'' the nurse said. `` I tried to go on the bus and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> started to swing her leg, as if to kick me. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> pushed me off the bus with both hands on my chest.'' Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> shouted, `` That is n't true! I never swung my leg.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> said that March 7 `` was the third time I was hit by <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, in the hallway of their apartment. I had gone in with a detective to get his -LRB- <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s -RRB- blood pressure.'' She said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> tried to block their entry, but <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> let them in. Ms. <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> said that when she put a blood pressure cuff on <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> struck me very forcefully on the arm and said, ` Do n't you put the make on my husband.'''

 In her zeal to raise money to fight cancer, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> saw a unique opportunity in the donation of 63,000 flawed water softener tanks. The <LOCATION> Geauga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is charging $ 1 to $ 2 for the tan, blue and white tanks, which stretch hundreds of yards on a tract that one day will be turned into a golf course. `` I'll probably be in a nursing home by the time we sell them all,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, the chapter's executive director, said Monday. `` But I'm the kind of person who likes to try anything once.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said the society has made more than $ 1,200 so far selling the tanks, which people in the county east of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> have been buying to use as drainage pipes, buoys, lawn rollers, boats and even dog houses. The cylindrical tanks, which have a hole in one end for pipe, range from 6-by-13 inches to 30-by-40 inches, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> here offered the tanks to the society about two months ago, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Steckley </PERSON>, the company's construction supervisor <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> acquired the tanks when it purchased 2,400 acres it plans to develop as housing and golf courses, <PERSON> Steckley </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province has been hit by its worst drought in a century, destroying more than 32 million acres of farmland and drying up much of its water supply, an official report said today. Only 1.24 inches of rain has fallen in the province since April, just 0.08 inches more than the same period in 1887, the overseas edition of the People's Daily said. About 1.3 million people and 470,000 heads of livestock are directly affected by the drought, which has dried up many of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>'s reservoirs and smaller rivers. Temperatures in the province have hovered around 100 degrees, the paper said. Officials said farmers have been unable to plant one-third of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>'s spring rice crop because of the water shortage. The water level of the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the source of hydroelectric power in <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>, has dropped below that of last year, the paper said, but did not say by how much. Severe drought also has afflicted northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in some areas lasting more than 20 months, but heavy rains fell in the northern and western provinces last Friday and Saturday, earlier reports said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been plagued by unusual weather this spring. Hailstorms struck central and coastal provinces last week, killing at least 21 people, injuring 370 and destroying homes and crops.

 Centenarians say the secrets to their longevity are not drinking, not smoking and not consorting with those who do. `` Live a good, clean, honest life,'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON>, 100, of <LOCATION> Unionville </LOCATION> recommended Monday as she and 13 other centenarians or near-centenarians from the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> area were honored by state officials Monday at a senior citizens' center here. She said she refused to marry a man because he would not promise never to drink beer. `` Have faith in God,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Osenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Terryville </LOCATION>, who is six months shy of her 100th birthday. `` Eat plain and wholesome food. No smoking or intoxicating liquor. Work hard.'' However, one man thought too much work was n't advisable. `` Work, but not too much,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabowski </PERSON>, 106, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` Just keep a-going,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Welcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Erikson </PERSON>, 103, of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Economist Says Chinese Economy Now In Critical Period</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A leading Chinese economist today said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has reached a crossroads that can lead either to the prosperity of greater reform or the dangers of a return to Soviet-style state planning. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Yining </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he feared backsliding in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old program of market-oriented reforms as the nation tries to cope with rising inflation and serious supply-demand imbalances. `` The danger now is not price rises or the education system,'' he said at a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> news conference. `` The danger is that the need to stabilize the economic situation will be used to bring back the traditional system.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, an outspoken proponent of stock ownership of state-run enterprises, said the traditional system was the Soviet-style command economy which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> followed until senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> started introducing market principles in 1978. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said there is general commitment to reform at the state level, but enterprises at the local level `` only know the old ways, and find it hard to change.'' The government, he said, `` needs to improve its propaganda work. We must tell ordinary people that in the past they had stable prices under conditions of poverty.'' A surge in retail prices in the past year has dampened enthusiasm among some government leaders for pushing ahead with reforms, and has given rise to theme of maintaining economic stability. In the first quarter of this year the government said retail prices rose 11 percent compared to the same period in 1987, while food prices were up 17.9 percent. Asked about the policies of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who is regarded as favoring greater stability and a slower pace of reform, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said he agreed with the premier's statement that increasing supply is the best way to correct supply-demand imbalances. To do this, the economist said, `` We must readjust the structure of enterprises, stimulate the activities of labor and promote the flow of productive factors.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, however, that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can not rush into reforms of its state-controlled pricing system, which has led to shortages of goods and failed to meet rising consumer demand. Complete decontrol of prices would fuel inflation and lead to a run on bank deposits because price rises would outstrip bank interest rates. Price reforms should be carried out over a six-to-eight year period, he said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said he supported recent moves by the government to end price controls on pork, vegetables and other non-staple food items and replace them with direct subsidies to urban consumers. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which kept prices virtually unchanged during the first 30 years of Communist rule, `` should n't be afraid of small price rises,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who spent six years in labor reform camps during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution for questioning Soviet-style state planning, said prosperity in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> depends on changing systems of ownership, letting the value of most goods be determined by the market and making entrepreneurs and family farmers the backbone of the economy. Socialism, he said, must be based on a commodity, or market, economy. `` As long as the economy prospers and living standards are raised, our purpose is fulfilled. People will see that socialism is not connected with poverty but wealth.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> envisioned three types of stock markets for enterprises: one where shares could be traded only among public enterprises, one where employees would hold and trade shares and one open to anyone. Asked about the need for democratic reforms to accompany changes in the economy, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said: `` Socialist democracy, like socialist realism, ca n't develop overnight. As long as we are moving in the right direction it is fine.'' In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he said, `` Many things are irrational. But we ca n't just get rid of them.

<BYLINE>Soviet Abuse of Psychiatry Continues Despite Some Reform,
Psychiatrist Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 World opinion has produced reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s use of psychiatric hospitalization for political repression, but the policy seems to be continuing despite glasnost, a dissident Soviet psychiatrist says. Although many dissidents have been released from psychiatric hospitals, a substantial number remain, said <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON>. And a well-publicized new set of official guidelines on hospitalizing psychiatric patients makes no substantial difference, he said. It allows `` a very broad opportunity for any citizen to be forcibly taken for an examination'' at the request of police, employers, co-workers or neighbors, he said. <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON>, who was allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after spending six years in prison for publicizing psychiatric abuses, lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. He spoke to reporters Monday through an interpreter at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A recent conversation with a Soviet contact found 20 to 25 well-documented cases of unjust confinement in psychiatric hospitals, but that is only `` a minute portion of the total number,'' he said. Various groups that monitor the problem estimate that 500 people are in Soviet psychiatric hospitals because of political or religious activities, or for organizing labor unions or speaking out against conditions in the workplace, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, director of international affairs for the American psychiatric organization. As a result of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost or openness, the Soviet press has begun to write about the unjust hospitalizations. But <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON> said the coverage tries to make them sound like bureaucratic oversights or medical incompetence rather than an official policy. He also said dissidents who have been released from psychiatric hospitals still carry a diagnosis of mental illness and must register at local mental health centers. Although Soviet authorities say millions of names will be removed from local registers, that only means the people will not be regarded as needing psychiatric help any longer, he said. No official recognition will be given to the fact that the diagnosis was erroneous and politically motivated in the cases of dissidents, and as a result they will not be rehabilitated legally and socially, he said.

<HEAD>Lebanese Factions Use Lull In Fighting To Fortify Positions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rival Shiite Moslem militias fortified their positions or brought in reinforcements today, taking advantage of a lull in fighting that came after <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> warned the four-day carnage must stop. Police said no casualties were reported overnight from the confrontations in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The fighting, which had simmered down to sporadic gunfire by this morning, has killed 154 people and wounded 367 since it broke out Friday. The casualty toll included 65 people killed and 50 wounded on Monday. Police said 36 Syrian officers moved into the area with six committees in an effort to implement a truce in fighting between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The battle for control of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, where an estimated 250,000 Shiites live, raised fears about the fate of 18 foreign hostages. They include nine Americans and most are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers in the 16-square-mile Shiite enclave. The committees _ each of which has a Syrian officer, an Iranian Embassy official, a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and another of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> _ set up truce observation posts in the slums before dawn, a police spokesman said. The committees `` are trying to convince the warring factions to observe a cease-fire as a first step,'' said the spokesman, who can not be identified in line with standing regulations. A three-point proposal announced Monday calls for a truce, withdrawal of gunmen from streets and return of the warring factions to positions they controlled before the fighting began, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which has gained control of half of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the clashes, `` rejects the return to pre-Friday positions,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen, the spokesman said, were using the relative lull to barricade their positions with high earth mounds in the densely populated districts of <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mesharafiyeh </PERSON>. Amal, which controls all gateways to the disputed south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was bringing in reinforcements, he said. Amal militiamen, according to the spokesman, controlled the districts of Haret Hreik, Mreiji, <PERSON> Roweiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kasskass </LOCATION>. `` It appears that both sides are preparing for another round of fighting,'' he said. Many of the estimated 250,000 residents of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> also appeared convinced that another round of fighting is yet to come. The spokesman said scores of civilians carrying clothes and other personal belongings left the embattled areas overnight to safer places in Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said about 60 percent of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s residents already have evacuated the disputed area. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurdi </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photo technician, was trapped with his wife and six children Friday in a shelter in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION>, but escaped Monday. `` Shells rained nonstop around us,'' he said. `` Kids screamed and there was no way to comfort them or feed them.'' When fighting abated for a short time, <PERSON> Kurdi </PERSON> said, `` I told my wife ` This is our chance to get out.' We did, dodging sniper fire as we ran out of Bir el-Abed.'' The thunder of shellfire rolled over the city all day and into the night. Gunmen atop racing ambulances fired into the air to clear traffic so the wounded could reach hospitals. Radio stations appealed for blood donations. Doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded fighters were dragged from ambulances and hospitals and slaughtered by their rivals. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 25,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including 7,500 in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It is the main power broker after 13 years of civil war but is being challenged by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which the Syrians support in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Fighting eased as the committees drove into the slums, but sporadic bursts of cannon and machine-gun fire echoed in the region well into the night. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites are its largest sect. With <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s blessing, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> crushed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> last month in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The four-day battle cost 62 lives and 150 people were wounded.

<HEAD>Hungary's Communist Party Leaders Tackle Crucial Reforms</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s increasingly divided communist party met today to discuss reforms that critics say do not go far enough to solve the nation's serious economic problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting is a prelude to a national party conference on May 20, where the future of party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> may be debated. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who is almost 76, has led the party since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> crushed an anti-Soviet revolution in 1956. While he pioneered reforms that made <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> relatively prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> now is increasingly blamed for the country's economic crisis. Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a leading contender to succeed <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, has fueled speculation about <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s future by saying that `` the laws of biology also apply to politicians,'' an apparent reference to <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s age. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last week and told reporters that today's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting will elect a committee to make proposals on party personnel changes Those proposals are to be reviewed at another <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting after the two-day party conference. `` In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending the conference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and if these changes include the person of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, he will accept the decision,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying on the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has said he would step aside if asked. But he has given no signal that he intends to relinquish control of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> any time soon. Last month, four of the most outspoken reformist Communists were abruptly expelled from the party, a sign that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and the party's old guard still have clout. Articles in the state-run media and a fierce debate over how much political pluralism to allow in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> testify to the increasing turmoil in party ranks. A draft policy paper for the May 20 conference proposes some political reforms, including secret ballots, multi-candidate party elections and limited terms of office for party officials. But critics say the proposals, while allowing for a wider choice in party elections, make no provision for genuine pluralism and emphasize the need for Communists to stick rigidly to party policy when making public statements. The latter requirement is seen by some observers as an attack on <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, an outspoken <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and leading proponent of change. He has called for changes in the constitution that would provide for referendums, guarantee the independence of interest groups and review the party's role in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s changing society. `` There is a need to rethink the whole structure of socialism,'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said in a recent interview in the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> daily. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, who heads the communist-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ an umbrella organization for the party, unions and social groups _ has said there will be no real change in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> without political reforms that `` renewed public consensus. The reformers' arguments that political change is essential to long-term economic progress have been bolstered in recent months by continued economic crisis. With a gross foreign debt of more than $ 17 billion, this nation of 10.6 million people has eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest per capita debt. Inflation is running at more than 15 percent, and official economists say unemployment may reach 200,000 by 1990 if austerity measures imposed by <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> force unprofitable state firms to close.

 A Panamanian official said a decision by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to have his chartered Panamanian plane fly to an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> air base, reportedly because of security concerns, constituted a hijacking. Maj. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, also told a news conference Monday that a relative of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ousted civilian president was aboard the plane. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made the decision after he saw Panamanian security men arguing with his own security detail on the tarmac at the small civilian Paitilla airport on Sunday. `` It was a judgment call,'' an embassy statement said. `` The ambassador's security detail made the judgment that the -LRB- situation at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> -RRB- was not a good environment.'' The plane remained Sunday night at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zone </LOCATION>, about five miles from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told reporters that the plane failed to follow necessary `` procedures'' for a civilian aircraft to land at a military base and spend the night there. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials refused to provide any information about the plane after it landed at the air base. The plane's owner, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON>, told the news conference the embassy had not informed him his plane was at <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` As far as we are concerned, until we conclude the investigation, the plane was hijacked or stolen,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> declared. He said that <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son-in-law of former President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, and the son of an opposition leader were also on the plane. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since his dismissal Feb. 26, a day after he tried to fire Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian government, was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president and has demanded that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resign. The incident Sunday was the second apparent attempt by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security to interfere with the ambassador's movements. On April 3, a military vehicle tried to stop <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' limousine as he left the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. In another development, hundreds of people waited in line at banks on Monday to cash checks and make other withdrawals for the first time in nine weeks, although there were limits on how much they could take out. No withdrawals had been allowed since March 3, at some banks longer, because of runs on deposits and a severe cash shortage prompted in part by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Those sanctions have frozen $ 50 million in Panamanian government funds at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. Monday's step came only after bankers reluctantly agreed to a government plan to reopen with restrictions on withdrawals. New rules issued by the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> limit withdrawals from checking accounts to 25 percent of the balance on March 3, up to a maximum of $ 10,000. Some customers said they were able to cash checks as large as $ 1,600, while others came away empty-handed because the available balance from the account that issued the check already had been withdrawn. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said the Panamanian agents at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> airport were armed with M-16 rifles and shotguns and demanded passports and other documents. It said `` their manner was considered hostile.'' An embassy official said the aircraft remained at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> because `` a new flight plan must be filed'' before it could be flown out. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his party were returning Sunday from a day at the Contadora resort island.

 A jury began deliberations in the trial of reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and eight co-defendants accused of conspiracy and murder in the 1984 murder of a rival. The jury spent two hours in deliberations Monday before returning to their hotel. Deliberations were to resume today. Police allege that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, 59, ran the area's Mafia from his home in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, before his arrest in an unrelated extortion case in 1986. He and the other eight defendants were being tried for the Sept. 14, 1984, murder of <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s body, with two bullets in the head, was found trussed and wrapped in a blanket in a wooded area of southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The jury got the case Monday after closing arguments from <LOCATION> Scarfo </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, who attacked two former gangsters who were key prosecution witnesses and Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> conceded that the informants, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON>, were despicable men who talked only after they had been marked for death. `` Rats? Yes. But when you enter a sewer do n't rats lead the way?'' Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. `` In mob-related killings the commonwealth -LRB- of <LOCATION> Pennsyvlania </LOCATION> -RRB- does n't have the luxury of witnesses like <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` DelGiorno and Caramandi were n't members of the Knights of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> but of a secret, vicious underworld mob, an organization where killing was part of the power. -LRB- They -RRB- told you that <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> was the boss and that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s organization eliminated problems and dissension by simple execution,'' she said. The informants testified that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> gave the order to kill <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> because <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was threatening <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s control of the mob and because <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> broke his engagement to the daughter of one of <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s top lieutenants. Attorney <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> nephew <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonetti </PERSON>, identified during the trial as the mob's underboss, said the defense was confident of acquittal. `` We feel very, very good about it,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> were more cautious. `` I never think about it until they -LRB- the jury -RRB- tell me,'' she said. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said, `` I never feel confident when the case is in the jury's hands, but I'm hopeful.'' The trial began more than two months ago. Caramandi and <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was murdered in a closed south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> candy store. <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was lured by his best friend, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pungitore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, to the store, where <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> `` Wayne'' Grande of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> pumped two bullets into <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s head. The two witnesses said <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s body was transported in a van to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where it was dumped along a road. Besides <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> and Pungitore the other defendants are <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ventnor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Philadelphians </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannarella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Scafidi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannece </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> also faces charges in two other murders. Last year, he was convicted of conspiring with a former city councilman to extort $ 1 million from a waterfront developer. He is serving a 14-year prison sentence on that conviction.

 The prosecution of a renegade polygamist clan shifts to state homicide charges following the federal convictions of four family members on 20 counts stemming from a church bombing and 13-day police standoff. The jury, deliberating 25 hours over four days, returned guilty verdicts Monday against clan matriarch <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>; her son-in-law, ringleader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>; <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>; and her son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said his office intends to file state murder charges next week in the death of state corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> in the Jan. 28 assault by law officers that ended the standoff. `` And we do it all over again,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. The Swapp brothers and the wheelchair-bound <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> were found guilty of second-degree attempted murder of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents for the shootout that ended the 13-day siege at the clan's <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> farm. The panel acquitted Mrs. Singer of one count of attempted murder of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, an accompanying firearms charge and one count of possession of a sawed-off shotgun. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> set sentencing for July 1. Based on federal guidelines, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> estimated that <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> will serve 15 to 20 years in prison, and the other three defendants face 10 to 12 years, most likely in separate federal institutions. In addition to the attempted murder conviction, <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, was found guilty of maliciously damaging the church building, forcibly assaulting and resisting federal agents, and possession of an unregistered bomb. He also was found guilty of a corollary charge of use of a bomb on the malicious damage count and two counts of use of a firearm linked to the assault and attempted murder charges. Mrs. Singer, 45, was found guilty of the same charges, with the exception of the attempted murder charge and the corollary firearms charge. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, both 21, were found guilty of assault-resistance and attempted murder charges and the two accompanying firearms counts. Authorities have identified <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> as the triggerman in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death, but <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> would not say how many people would be charged. When they entered <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' courtroom for Monday's proceedings, all four defendants smiled and waved to family members. `` We've already won the victory!'' <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> shouted to reporters as he was led into the federal courthouse. <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, one of Mrs. Singer's two daughters married to <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, said of the verdict, `` I'm not disappointed in it because I expected it.'' Attorneys for <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said they planned appeals, mainly on the attempted murder conviction. Lawyers for Mrs. Singer and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who became engaged to a 20-year-old admirer during the trial and plans to be married in jail, also were considering appeals. The maximum penalty for attempting to kill federal agents is 20 years, 10 years for bombing the chapel. The firearms and use-of-a-bomb charges carry minimum mandatory five-year penalties. Assaulting federal agents and possession of a bomb each carry maximum 10-year terms. The prosecution called 67 witnesses ranging from elite <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> hostage rescue teams to Mormon bishops and ballistics experts. Defense attorneys called only three witnesses, including <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who admitted bombing the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> but insisted he never tried to kill law enforcement officers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> denounced the clan as `` a band of outlaws'' who committed crimes in the name of religion. `` Trust in the Lord but pass me my M-1 rifle,'' he said of <LOCATION> Addam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swapp </LOCATION>. Clan members invoked the name of their slain patriarch, polygamist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, throughout the siege and trial, claiming he was murdered in 1979 in a church - and state-backed conspiracy Singer, husband of Mrs. Singer and father-in-law of <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, was shot to death after he drew a gun on officers who had come to arrest him for refusing to send his children to public schools and return his second wife's children to their father.

The case was expanded in 1977 to cover all of the service's approximately 1,800 women employees throughout the state A 1981 consent decree called for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to end discrimination and upgrade female employees over a five-year period. Equal Rights Advocates returned to court last summer, saying the decree had not been followed.

<TEXT>
 An anti-apartheid newspaper made fun of a government official after it was ordered to cease publication under the country's emergency censorship regulations. An order in the official government gazette Monday said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town-based </LOCATION> newspaper with a multiracial readership, will be banned until June 10. South normally publishes Thursday, but in anticipation of the ban it published a special edition Monday that included a front-page likeness of Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in battle armor, wielding an axe. The censorship regulations empower <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to close publications he considers subversive for renewable three-month periods. His actions can not be challenged in court. `` At the root of the problem is apartheid and exploitation,'' said an editorial in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>'s special edition. `` We did not create the situation. We are only reporting it. And it is this ugly truth that the government ca n't stomach.'' South serves a readership of about 15,000, primarily in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area. It was founded in March 1987 with funds from European church groups. Its editor, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Seria </PERSON>, said at a news conference last month that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> had lost about $ 15,000 since it began publishing. In March, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> imposed a three-month ban on New Nation, a militant, black-oriented weekly with a national circulation of more than 50,000. Five other publications have been warned that they face possible closure. The paper believed to be next in line for possible banning is The Weekly Mail, with a predominantly white readership and strong support among liberal politicians, journalists and business executives. The newspaper's editors are trying to mobilize a campaign to save it and other threatened publications. The current state-of-emergency expires June 11. South could be banned for an additional two months if, as expected, the emergency is extended for another year. <PERSON> Seria </PERSON>, speaking to reporters after the ban was issued, said 21,500 copies of the special edition were printed. He said it was possible the government might demand that the issues be recalled. South's board of trustees, which includes the the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, issued a statement saying it was `` sheer madness'' for the government to ban newspapers rather than address <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political problems Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Curator: DeSillers `Imprudently' Spent Donations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> `` imprudently'' spent at least $ 200,000 in donations for her late son's care on herself and friends, including more than $ 30,000 for jewelry, clothing and a luxury car, says a court-appointed curator. In documents filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> gave the most detailed account yet of how money for Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, was spent. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> spent $ 44,359 to help other children needing transplants, according to bank records. `` The rest -LRB- of the money -RRB- appears to have been spent imprudently, for inappropriate reasons ... without proper authorization,'' wrote Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, an attorney appointed to oversee <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s estate. Her son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, 7, died at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant. His plight captured the nation's attention and donations poured in from across the country, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was scheduled to appear in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> today to contest charges by the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> secretary of state in a related case that she violated state charity laws by using donations to pay for personal expenses. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the allegations. She said she used much of the cash withdrawals to promote organ-donor awareness and gave money away to `` people with problems.'' According to the documents, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> made cash withdrawals of $ 96,526 and gave $ 23,700 to her ex-boyfriend for business losses and $ 7,284 to her ex-husband for car payments and expenses for his daughter from a previous marriage. Records also show that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> withdrew $ 6,134 from the account for her brother and $ 750 for her ex-boyfriend's mother. `` While Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has clearly suffered from the great personal tragedy of her son's death, she appears to have ignored the laws ... when it suited her purposes to do so,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> wrote in her preliminary report on the estate's assets. Almost $ 300,000 of the $ 527,000 that remained in <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s account when he died has been spent, according to court documents About $ 243,500 remains in the estate. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> is asking the court to return any remaining money to creditors and give the rest to other children who need transplants. A hearing is expected next month. Her attorney, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> frequently paid back friends and family members who had given her financial assistance when <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> was ill. In November, the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital sued Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> after she refused to pay the a $ 262,000 balance from her son's operations Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has charged that <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> received poor care, but hospital officials have denied it. The documents filed Monday show that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> bought $ 10,850 in jewelry and $ 5,797 in clothing. She used $ 3,163 from donations for furniture, $ 13,500 for a 1985 BMW, and $ 1,700 for rent at her <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bayfront apartment, according to records.

 Rescue workers had to cut a hole in the bedroom wall of a house to extract a 1,000-pound man who had to be hospitalized for acute bronchitis, officials said today. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnerty </PERSON>, 45, was taken to <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with the aid of a highway department truck equipped with a hydraulic lift, said Officer <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Yovino </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police. <PERSON> Yovino </PERSON> said police responded to a call of a man having difficulty breathing at 10 p.m. Monday.

<TEXT>
 A maintenance engineer apparently bypassed a safety system during last week's skyscraper blaze and died when he stopped an elevator manually at a fire-engulfed floor so hot that the elevator door partly melted, a city official said. The city's chief elevator inspector, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON>, said Monday that the elevators in the 62-story <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building did not malfunction during the Wednesday blaze that gutted the building's 12th through 16th floors. However, he said one person died and others suffered close calls when they bypassed the elevators' fire safety system, allowing them to stop on or near fire-engulfed floors. Forty people were hurt in the blaze in the state's tallest building. `` They -LRB- the elevators -RRB- all did what they're supposed to do,'' <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, fire officials said the cause of the blaze remains undetermined, but added that arson had largely been ruled out. They said, however, that the fire destroyed many clues to the cause. Earlier, Battalion Chief <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> downplayed speculation that the bank's planned sale of its securities unit played a role in the blaze that injured 40 people. `` No one interviewed has said that there's a possibility of an incendiary fire of any type,'' he said. <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> and bank officials said the fire apparently started on the 12th floor near a computer center where recent electrical work was performed. <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON>, who inspected the building's 33 elevators Monday, said the elevators serving the fire floors were activated by heat sensors, which sent them to the main floor. But he said the only person killed, maintenance engineer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Handy </PERSON>, and other maintenance workers in the building bypassed this safety system. Handy, 24, boarded elevator No. 33 and, using a special fire key, went to the 12th floor, where he died almost immediately. <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON> said Handy, after reaching the 12th floor, had to push an `` open'' button that allowed the door to remain open until a `` close'' button is pushed. <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON> said he found the fire's intense heat had partially melted the door of the elevator in which Handy died. `` The fire key was melted into the ` on' position,'' he said. He said other building maintenance workers using elevators in attempts to escape the flames must have activated independent service switches inside locked panels that overrode fire safety systems and allowed the workers to travel to floors 12 through 16. However, one worker, <PERSON> Radmila </PERSON> <PERSON> Radich </PERSON>, said the elevator safety system did not work properly. Ms. <PERSON> Radich </PERSON>, 40, said that after the fire started she called for an elevator while working on the 19th floor simply by pressing a button and that the elevator promptly arrived. Then, she said, she and another maintenance worker pushed the 13th-floor button, where they exited into choking smoke. They were able to crawl to safety in a stairwell.

 More than 700 people, at least half of them women and children, were evacuated from the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> complex today, a day after security forces laid siege to the shrine after an exchange of gunfire that claimed five lives. Sikh extremists fired intermittently today at security posts around the shrine. More than 2,500 paramilitary troops and police armed with automatic rifles and light machine guns have encircled the sprawling temple complex. The siege follows an exchange of fire between militants in the temple and paramilitary troops on Monday in which at least five people were killed and 10 injured. Police said most of the people who left the complex today were devotees who became trapped inside on Monday. Police searched and interrogated the men who left the temple. `` At least 30 or 40 of them will turn out to be terrorists trying to slip away,'' said Police Inspector J.S. <PERSON> Bhatia </PERSON>. A curfew imposed on the old, walled sector of the city remained in force for a second day, police said. Sikhs began firing on security positions on the perimeter of the 400-year-old shrine Monday. The gunfire subsided overnight, but resumed sporadically this morning, police said. Seven Indian reporters and photographers who had been in the shrine told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that at least 100 Sikh militants armed with Chinese-made AK-47 and American M-16 automatic rifles were firing from eight to 10 bunkers within the temple complex. The reporters and photographers, who spent much of Monday trapped in the temple as the firefight raged, emerged overnight. They said heavily fortified positions could be seen on western, eastern and northern walls of the complex, which is centered by the golden-domed temple that is <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for more autonomy or an independent homeland for Sikhs in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, contending their minority sect is discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus Sikhs are about 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population of 780 million, while Hindus are 80 percent. The confrontation began Monday afternoon on the shrine's western perimeter. Commanders of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state police and federally controlled paramilitary forces had gone to a security post on a nearby rooftop to view what was suspected to be the start of construction of a concrete bunker outside the temple's western wall. Police said militants inside the shine opened fire on the commanders. <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>, a Sikh who is deputy inspector general of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and four of his companions were injured, police said. A bullet was removed from <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>'s chin. The police opened fire on the Sikh gunmen in the temple, and heavy exchanges for more than three hours subsequently died down to intermittent firing. Five people were killed, including two civilians and three militants, police said. It was the worst in a series of clashes that began shortly after militant Sikh priest <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON> was released from federal custody and made the temple's chief priest in March. Rode had been in custody for more than two years under the government's anti-terrorism rules. He was released in an effort by Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to placate extremist Sikhs and lure them into negotiations. Since Rode's return, there have been persistent reports that the militants were building bunkers and firing ports in the temple complex. On April 29, extremists fired on a police post near the shrine after security forces attempted to arrest a Sikh militant. The militant escaped under the cover fire and fled into the temple complex. The army stormed the Golden Temple complex in June 1984 to drive out militants, and some 1,200 people were killed. Less than four months later, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge. <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> was founded 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to warring Islam and <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>. A later leader turned it into a warring religion in which all males must carry knives.

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Defends Administration's Seizure Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> today defended the seizure of a $ 2.5 million yacht for carrying less than a teaspoon of marijuana and said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will continue to enforce its toughened seizure policy. `` We did n't decide that we were going to go out and seize big expensive yachts over tiny bits of marijuana,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` What I announced a few weeks ago was if we find any illegal drugs on a vessel, we're going to seize a vessel, we're going to turn it over to Customs and we're going to let them make the final determination about whether the vessel should be returned to the owner or sold at auction.'' The 133-foot Ark Royal was confiscated in international waters off <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on Saturday after a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boarding party found about 10 marijuana seeds and two stems in a trash can and dresser drawer, the crew and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Custody of the ship, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Tomima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was turned over to <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>; the yacht's six-member crew was put ashore but not charged Sunday night. The vessel could be auctioned as forfeited property after several hearings, authorities said. The government's toughened policy provides for seizure of any vessel when any amount of illegal drugs is found. Previously, boats were seized only when large amounts of drugs were found, and the vessels were held in lieu of a fine based on the weight of the drugs. `` We've got a massive national problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We've got people out there whether they own big boats or little boats, big cars or little cars; we've got people of all economic classes who are buying this stuff and we got to get at the demand side of this problem or we're not ever going to be able to get it under control. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, interviewed from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the owner of the ship `` will be permitted to make whatever case he wishes to about why there were drugs found on it and Customs will make the final determination about whether the boat is returned to the owner or sold at auction.'' `` Nobody will lose a boat without a hearing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> added later. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, national legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the policy is violates the Constitution. `` What's wrong with it is the same thing that's wrong with shooting someone or hanging someone and then saying, we're going to give you a trial to see if your guilty,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` In our society, we have always held that a person is innocent until proven guilty and the burden is on the government to prove someone of guilt before taking such drastic actions,'' he said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, interviewed with <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>, said the Constitutional provision `` that prohibits the government from taking property without due process and that's what's happening in this case.''

<HEAD>Authorities Speculate On DiGilio Disappearance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have begun an investigation into the whereabouts of reputed crime kingpin <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>, who has disappeared a week before his scheduled sentencing on a loansharking conviction. Authorities said Monday there could be a reasonable explanation for <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s departure. They also speculated it could be the result of organized crime strife or punishment for his outspokenness. Some officials also saw it as a possible ploy in connection with his approaching sentencing. `` I hope he's gone fishing, but I would n't bet my paycheck on it,'' state police Superintendant Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, said investigators had not settled on a theory and were tapping their street sources and law enforcement agencies for information. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, filed a missing persons report Saturday, saying she had had no contact with the former boxer from <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> since Thursday evening. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, said his client missed a Friday meeting to discuss efforts to overturn his recent loan sharking conviction in <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>. Sentencing is set for next week. <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> said <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>, who law enforcement officials say is a powerful soldier in the Genovese organized crime family, was upbeat about his victory last month in a federal waterfront racketeering trial and was confident about overturning the state conviction. `` He's not traveling,'' <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> said. `` He would have told somebody if he was traveling.'' A DiGilio associate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingartner </PERSON>, said he had no idea where <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was. `` We're all worried,'' he said. `` It's just very strange. We've been swamped with calls.'' Executive Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kracov </PERSON>, who prosecuted the federal case, said chances were `` 50-50'' <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> met with foul play. <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> speculated that <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s high-profile ways may have angered his alleged mob superiors, including reputed Genovese boss <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> `` The Chin'' Gigante of Old Tappan. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> spoke freely with reporters, acted as his own attorney in the federal trial, engaged in a widely publicized courthouse brawl with a co-defendant and has sued the federal government for harassment. `` Experience tells us that when you act like he acted, you're not long for this world,'' said <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON>, referring to others in mob history eliminated for talkativeness In contrast, <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> strives to keep a low profile. Authorities say <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was rising the same way <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> did _ through racketeering on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waterfront. In the backdrop of <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s disappearance is evidence of growing tension between the Genovese and <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> organized crime families, he said. He said <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> was aligned with former Gambino boss <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, whose killing, police sources have said, was ordered by current reputed boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, quoting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, has reported that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> warned <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> that <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> had sanctioned a contract on his life. <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> has been known to wander the streets of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in a bathrobe, and has avoided trial through claims of mental incompetence. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> has used erratic behavior to delay trials, and <PERSON> Kracov </PERSON> suggested his disappearance may be a similar game. One law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, doubted that was likely because he said <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> would n't do anything to take himself off the streets, where he keeps close tabs on his alleged illegal interests

 Californians who fear a devastating earthquake in the nation's second largest city based on the purported prediction of 16th century seer Nostradamus are falling prey to superstition and nonsense, state emergency officials say. The prediction `` is pure, unadulterated bunk,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Medigovich </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday by telephone from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want people to plan -LRB- for quakes -RRB- out of fear of predictions like this,'' he said. `` We want them to do it on a rational basis.'' But hundreds of people called earthquake information hotlines, some left the region and children expressed fear because of a vague prediction by <PERSON> Nostradmus </PERSON> and a 1981 movie, now sold on videotape, called `` The Man Who Could See Tomorrow.'' The film, narrated by `` War of the Worlds'' prankster <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>, claimed the French seer said the area would be wrecked by a huge quake this month. Some astrologers have said a big quake is most likely this week. Students at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, satirized the paranoia Monday with an `` End of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' at the student union pub, complete with `` free death cake'' and disaster movies, said <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarron </PERSON> of the school's student life office. `` Predictions based on clairvoyance, headaches, animal behavior, astrology and other bogus methods have no basis in science and should be categorically disregarded,'' said a statement released Monday by state <ORGANIZATION> Seismic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says a major, devastating quake is more than 50 percent likely in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the next 25 years. But if one occurs this week or month, `` as far as the Nostradamus prediction, it will be coincidental,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prediction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, hundreds who fear the prediction swamped phone lines at <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of these people are n't kooks.

Psychologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said worried callers swamped the hotline at <LOCATION> Charter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He partially blamed revelations in a book by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> that First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted astrologers. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> real estate broker, said she leased a dozen homes for people who left town for the month, and leased another 15 to wealthy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> residents who came to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the month because someone started a rumor a big quake would hit the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said he tells callers Nostradamus never predicted a quake, only a hailstorm, and that the alleged prediction refers only to `` the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' not <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Even if you believe in Nostradamus, the prediction is totally bogus,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. `` The prediction came out of that 1981 movie and they translated it very liberally.

 Israeli soldiers banged on doors and seized Palestinian identity papers today, the start of a month-long campaign to force 400,000 Arabs in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to renew their government ID cards. Arab underground leaders issued a warning from a mosque loudpeaker, ordering Gazans not to cooperate with the army. They said the program was an attempt to abort the Palestinian uprising. Also today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded a Palestinian after their jeep was stoned in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Ramin </PERSON>, the army command said. The unidentified youth was taken to <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> hospital where he was in serious condition, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. A soldier was slightly injured in the incident. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hundreds of people crowded into a school which has been converted into a makeshift registration center. Many said the army forced them to come. `` At dawn this morning, the troops entered people's homes. They knocked at the door and asked for IDs and told us we had to change them,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalo </PERSON>, a Moslem religious leader from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. One witness told an Arab reporter that soldiers confiscated one portion of the Israeli-issued identity cards, without which the card becomes invalid. Soldiers told residents of <LOCATION> Rimal </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood of 8,000 people that was the first area targeted by the program, to bring two color photographs, fill out applications and pay $ 10 for new cards. The orders affect Palestinians between the age of 18 and 60. Israeli authorities say the new cards are being issued because many of the old ones are torn and worn. Palestinians say the measure is aimed at increasing military control over the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> population and breaking a tax boycott, one of the chief tactics of the uprising. Military officials have said residents will have to pay back taxes before being issued new ID cards. Arabs in the occupied lands must carry an identity card at all times and show the card at frequent security checks. Identity cards are vital for all transactions with the military government. Many Arabs who showed up today were angry because there was only one official to process their applications. `` It is <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> -LRB- a Moslem holy month. -RRB- We are fasting,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, 26. `` We are not animals to spend all day here waiting.'' Israeli troops set up several roadblocks near the registration center and patroled the area with jeeps. A group of Palestinian youths about 20 yards from the center set tires afire, threw stones at passing cars and told adults not to renew their cards. When army jeeps raced to the scene, the youths ran off. `` The refusal to change the ID cards is the beginning of civil disobedience,'' said one slogan painted on a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> wall. An 18-year-old Palestinian who identified himself only as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> said he would not change his card. `` On the new IDs they will write all the previous times I was in prison,'' he said. `` If it's written on the ID that I was in prison I will get special treatment. Every time I get stopped, they will beat me.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army kept a curfew today on the Dheisheh refugee camp, where on Monday troops opened fire to disperse stone-throwing youths. Israeli newspapers reported that a 34-year-old father of seven who died at Dheisheh was killed by a stray bullet while he was at his home up the hill from the protest. The daily Hadashot identified the victim as <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. His death brought to 185 the number of Arabs killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have been slain. Curfews were in place today in the village of <LOCATION> Irtas </LOCATION>, where troops wounded three Palestinians during a protest Monday, and the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> and Jabaliya refugee camps. Elsewhere in the occupied lands and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a general strike called by underground leaders halted most commerce for a second day. Israeli radio reported, however, that thousands of Palestinian from the occupied territories went to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday stayed the deportation order of Arab-American activist <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> until a hearing May 23, but rejected a defense motion for his release from jail after Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> could endanger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, was moved today to <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> prison from the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> lockup where he had been held since Thursday, a police spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The government has accused <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an advocate of civil disobedience against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, of inciting Palestinians to violence. It also says his tourist visa expired. The defense argues that Awad can not be deported because he was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> also is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen and has a home in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

He called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s schools the nation's worst and said the city's system was in an `` educational meltdown.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 44, called for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military to wage war against drug traffickers and quarreled with the surgeon general over what to teach children about AIDS and condoms. The outgoing secretary refused to discuss his plans after he leave office, but they are believed to include hitting the lecture circuit and writing a book on the future of education.

<TEXT>
 A high school health teacher who wanted to give his students a break from serious classwork showed his students a videotape detailing gruesome deaths and animal slaughter. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> admits he realized that showing 45 minutes of `` Faces of Death'' to his second-period class Monday was a mistake. Even so, he showed the film to later classes because students talked him into it. `` It was a bad choice,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is also an assistant football coach at <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The 105-minute videotape shows `` autopsies, dismemberment, physical cruelty, human combustion and electrocution,'' its package says. Video stores also bill the movie as offering `` the most bizarre, grisly death experiences.'' <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, the manager of a <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> video store, said `` Faces of Death'' is `` probably one of the most popular things we have in here.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he rented the video Friday and planned to show it Monday as a break from regular classwork. Students were not required to watch the film and were allowed to work on other subjects while the tape was playing. Still, some of the 42 students who saw the video complained about it. `` He probably should n't have shown it,'' said student <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, who called the movie `` pretty disgusting, pretty cruel.'' <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> said the movie showed people hammering on a monkey's head and eating its contents and showed the slaughter of sheep and cows <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> turned off the movie just as a woman's body was cut open, she said. Her mother, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, said parents should have been notified beforehand. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Limle </PERSON>, another student, said she kept her back turned and worked on homework, but `` the sound effects were even disgusting.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said some of his students suggested the movie, but added that he did not view the videotape before showing it to his second-period class. After the first showing, he said, he realized it had been a mistake. He said he showed it to his third - and fifth-period classes later though because he allowed the students to `` talk me into it. Assistant principal <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON> said he would have to see the video tape before determining whether it was unsuitable for high school students.

 Police said today they have arrested a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> who allegedly hijacked an airliner to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1970, and are investigating whether he was planning terrorist attacks on the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police identified <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, 34, as one of nine <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members who commandeered a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 with 138 people aboard to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on March 31, 1970. The hijackers freed some passengers during a stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and released the rest after the plane landed in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, formed in the late 1960s, has called for `` simultaneous world revolution'' and has in recent years operated primarily with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leftists in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The terrorist group has never had more than 300 adherents, according to police. Police said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> was arrested near his <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> apartment Friday and was identified through fingerprints. He is the first suspect in the hijacking to be detained. The other hijackers reportedly are in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Police said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> obtained a false Japanese passport in July 1986 by using the family registry of a man with dual Japanese and North Korean citizenship. They said they did not know when <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> last entered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators were questioning <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> about possible terrorist attacks on the Olympics in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` As part of <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> police efforts to ensure the safety of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, we are investigating to see whether <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> came back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to plan attacks on the Games,'' the official said. <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>'s arrest follows a series of recent incidents reportedly involving <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members. Suspected Red Army member <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, was arrested April 13 at a rest area along a highway in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> after police found three homemade bombs in his car. Also in April, Italian police put another reported <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member, <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, on an international wanted list for his alleged involvement in the car-bomb attack on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> in which five people were killed. Last November, <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> police arrested alleged <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Air Terminal after he arrived on a flight from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> with a false passport. He was wanted in connection with an attack at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on May 30, 1972, and the hijacking of a jetliner over <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1977. In the Lod Airport massacre, three Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members who had arrived on a French airliner sprayed machine gun fire and hurled hand grenades into a crowded luggage claim area. Twenty-six people were killed, including two of the three terrorists. The surviving attacker was detained by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security officers and freed in 1985 as part of an exchange of 1,100 Palestinian and other prisoners for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers.

 Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said today that he hopes to restore full postal service by the end of summer. `` Our tentative goal is ... late summer,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said at a breakfast with reporters. Window hours at most post offices have been reduced by a half-day a week, and Sunday sorting operations and box collections were cut earlier this year, following congressionally imposed budget reductions for the agency. The service reductions save $ 9 million a month, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said, and restoring them means that amount of money must be saved in some other way, with improved efficiency and cutting other spending. Rate increases imposed on April 3 do not affect the service changes, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. The accounting system required by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> results in the increased income being counted as a reduction in the national debt, not as extra money for the agency.

 Authorities halted commuter trains and changed an airport landing pattern today after a gunman holed up in an apartment building for several hours, wounding a police officer and threatening to fire at planes and trains. `` He's taken many wild shots,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Heying </PERSON> of the county sheriff's police. The man walked out of the building at about 8:50 a.m. after a 4 -LCB- hour seige, <PERSON> Heying </PERSON> said.

He said officials treated the incident as a hostage situation although there was no confirmation of anyone held captive. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, 36, who lives on the third floor estimated that 100 shots were fired. `` I'm hearing five at a time, then 10, there's so many,'' she said. The gunman threatened to use plastic explosives and shoot at trains and airplanes, the sergeant said. Residents of the building were told to stay indoors. Air traffic from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> that normally would travel over <LOCATION> Bensenville </LOCATION> was diverted, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is hesitant about bothering the people who work for him _ so much so that he once let smoke pour from the fireplace in his office rather than call for help, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not want to make any demands on anyone, the president's former chief of staff says in `` For the Record,'' the newest collection of out-of-school tales by a White House departee. So the chief executive did nothing when a fire, caused by a clogged chimney in his study in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>, broke out.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 `` He stayed at his desk,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote, `` reading his documents with smarting eyes, until the guards asked if he would n't like to move to another room while they put out the fire and the place aired out. He had n't wanted to bother anybody.'' In his book, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> offers contradictory portrayals of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ on one hand picturing the president as disengaged and indecisive, a leader who `` laid down no rules and articulated no mission,'' and on the other hand drawing him as involved and interested. In contrast to his harsh depiction of first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he describes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as judicious, eager to hear both sides; a formidable reader who carries thick folders of reading material under his arm when he leaves the office for the family quarters around 4 p.m. daily; incapable of uttering an unkind word about others and in love with his job. So <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: _ Is aware of what he does n't know `` He hesitates to ask questions or confess to a lack of knowledge in the presence of strangers,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote, `` and thanks to the way his staff operated, nearly everyone was a stranger to this shy president except the members of his innermost circle.'' _ `` Would apologize for asking a basic _ sometimes even a startling basic _ question about an arcane subject.'' _ Has a good working command of economics `` His grasp of basic economic theory as it had been taught in his time -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, class of'32 -RRB- was excellent and he had kept abreast of later theory,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. `` He had no trouble understanding the leading ideas of the day, or in making reasonable judgments about the effects produced by policies based on Keynesian theory, of which he was deeply suspicious.'' _ `` Is a formidable reader and a talented conversationalist with a gift for listening,'' and a man who, at heart, `` is an old-fashioned, small-town American who believes what he reads in the papers.'' _ Gets in trouble because of his capacity to remember _ and believe _ everything that is told to him `` If someone told him -LRB- to use a wholly fictitious example -RRB- that there had been 35,987 hairs in <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s mustache, this fact would go into the presidential memory bank, possibly to emerge weeks or months later in the middle of a press conference,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. `` It never seemed to occur to him that anyone would give him incorrect information. His mind was a trove of facts and anecdotes, something like the morgue of one of his favorite magazines, Reader's Digest, and it was impossible to guess when or why he might access any one of these millions of bytes of data.'' _ Loves the routine of his job Wrote <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>: `` He regarded his daily schedule as being something like a shooting script in which characters came and went, scenes were rehearsed and acted out, and the plot was advanced one day at a time. ... If he was scheduled to receive a visitor at 10 o'clock, he would finish whatever else he was doing at 9:58, clear off his desk, clear his mind of whatever had gone before and prepare himself for the next scene.'' _ Perks up when women are present <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said everyone who travels with the president has come to believe that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> assigns its prettiest stewardesses to the plane carrying the White House press corps. `` This happy circumstance did not escape the president's notice,'' he wrote. `` When Air Force One landed, the president always looked for the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> stewardesses from the press plane and gave them a fatherly wave. They waved back enthusiastically, pretty young women in their uniforms smiling at the most famous man in the world. It was a moment everyone looked forward to on presidential journeys.'' _ Displays no enthusiasm for an annual tradition: accepting the national Thanksgiving turkey `` The president always groaned when he saw this on his schedule and more than once suggested that the vice president stand in for him,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. `` ` Oh, no you do n't!'' I would reply. ` You've got to have your picture taken with the <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, Mr. President _ it's tradition.''

 Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> squared off today in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> primaries as an impassioned <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made a new plea on behalf of family farmers and insisted it's not too late for him to make a comeback in the presidential race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called on Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to detail his knowledge of drug allegations against Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's comments on Monday came as aides to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fielded mounting questions about when the vice president first became aware of the allegations against the Panamanian strongman, who was indicted on federal drug charges in February. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not campaign Monday and had no campaign appearances scheduled today. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, the secretary of state's chief of staff, said, `` The weather's real good throughout the state. In the counties we've talked to, we've had a respectable turnout.'' In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke with reporters after spending the night at the rural home of <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>. He said, `` Family farmers have become isolated from the political process.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> ca n't supply the economic nutrition to this country that family farmers can,'' he said, referring to the giant food and grain conglomerates. On Monday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> staged a primary-eve scramble for votes in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has taken the last few days off from campaigning, spent the day at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` This is a live race. ... Every voter counts,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declared Monday as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, he told supporters: `` I'm coming to the last lap I'm running longer and running stronger because my mind is made up ... Press on! Press on!'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in the two states last week. Today's contests do not offer an especially large share of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> delegates _ 37 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 25 in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Of the 2,081 delegates needed to nominate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 1,519.7 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 933.1 according to the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' count. But two more victories would help cement <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' grip on the nomination, which aides have been saying he could clinch in the season-closing primaries June 7 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ who won last week's District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> primary but notched no primary victories in the six weeks prior to that _ a strong showing in either state would be a welcome respite. Even before today's contests were decided, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was heading for the next battleground: <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which holds its primary a week from today, with 45 Democratic delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met Monday with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, and aides said the two talked about U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already made <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of foreign policy experience an issue. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he did not think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was vulnerable on the issue. `` Experience is no substitute for ability and he's got real ability,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, zeroed in on a foreign-policy matter that is becoming a sticky one for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's dealings with him. `` Who was dealing with him and why?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Were we paying him and if so why? I can tell you one thing: If I'm the president we wo n't be doing business with drug-running Panamanian dictators.'' Questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> flared up anew when The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified administration officials, said Sunday that the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, had told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in December 1985 about the allegations. But <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, now posted to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, told reporters he had not presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with evidence of a Noriega-drug link. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was aware of rumors of drug involvement by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government prior to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said the reports were unsubstantiated, and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was one of a number of countries about which there were such reports. In other developments: _ The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner would be receiving <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection effective Wednesday _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> released a list of prominent Democratic women Monday, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should consider them for key convention roles as well as for the vice presidential nomination The list of 47 current and former officeholders included Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>; Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>; former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came under renewed attack from former Democratic Gov <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, who beat him in 1978 but was defeated by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1982. King, who subsequently switched parties, said Monday in a speech in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deserves no credit for the state's economic turnaround. King has appeared on television and radio shows in recent weeks to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with his expenses paid for by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. _ <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who technically remains a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a mathematical lock on the nomination, addressed a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gathering in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Monday night. The former television evangelist has said he will work to elect a Republican in the fall, but added: `` I'm still campaigning in my own right ... I'm not finished yet.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet dissidents today accused police of breaking into the office of an unofficial journal and arresting editor <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> without arrest or search warrants. They demanded his immediate release. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> police still were guarding the small country house outside the city where <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> was arrested Monday. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON>, an editor of <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>' Glasnost magazine, said almost 400 copies of the journal and a new publication for young people had been taken from the house. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, had agreed to allow a group seeking to found a political party called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to hold its final organizing session at his editorial office Monday afternoon. ` He is not a member of the group,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said of her husband. `` He intended to be there as an observer, nothing more.'' The house is in the village of <LOCATION> Kratkovo </LOCATION>, about 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, in an area closed to foreigners. Correspondents could not travel there to get first-hand information. After the arrest of <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> and several others, about 70 people gathered at a nearby club to form the political party, which calls for multi-party parliamentary democracy, independent trade unions, a new constitution and withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seized in World War II. During the weekend, 60 of the group's supporters were reported arrested in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and one of its founders, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, said Monday that 14 remained in jail. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for more democratic election procedures, including multiple-candidate elections. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>' magazine is named for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost _ openness on some social issues. Lawyer <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelisyenko </PERSON> said police had no arrest warrant for <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> or any of the others, and no search warrant to enter the building. He said he was allowed to talk to <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> at the local police station about five hours after the arrest, and even then police had no documents that would have permitted them to make the arrest. The Independent Union of Journalists of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>, a group publishers of unofficial journalist which <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> heads, issued a statement saying, `` the repressive measures against the chief editor of the journal Glasnost we regard as one of the main signals that governing organs of the country are undermining those hopes they sowed in the spirits of the people.'' It demanded that <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> be freed at once, that impounded copies of Glasnost be returned, court action be started against police who arrested <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>. The statement also said that if there is a legal basis for action against <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, the reason should be stated publicly. <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON> said police first arrested <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> outside the house. Twenty minutes later they returned, broke down five doors and arrested four other people, he said. He said <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> did not resist. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> later was found guilty of disobeying a police officer and given a seven-day jail sentence, but <PERSON> Yeliseyenko </PERSON> told reporters that dissidents had not been able to determine the charges against the other men. Dissidents said they were told police acted on a complaint by the daughter of a 96-year-old woman who rented the country house to <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> that he had no right to be there. Mrs. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said her husband had reached a valid agreement with the woman in January to rent the house.

 <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has decided to permanently remove from service three aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners that were grounded after another <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> jet blew open on an inter-island hop last month. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Goto </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> spokesman, called the Monday move a business decision designed to maintain public confidence, and not a result of any problems. `` In our opinion these aircraft are very airworthy,'' <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said. `` But because the investigation has focused on aircraft cycles, age and possible structural problems associated with age, we feel there is a cloud over these airplanes.'' <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> grounded the planes April 29, a day after a flight attendant was killed and 61 passengers were injured when part of the passenger cabin's roof tore off Aloha Flight 243. Pilots were able to land the plane on the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. The jet carrying 89 passengers, five crew members and an air traffic controller, blew open at 24,000 feet, exposing passengers to open air. An aircraft cycle refers to the number of times an airplane has taken off and landed. Federal investigators said the jet that blew open April 28 had about 89,000 cycles. <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said the three jets removed from service had about 50,000, 60,000 and 85,000 cycles respectively. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators suspect structural failure brought on by age may have caused the front 20 feet of the 19-year-old plane's passenger cabin to tear away. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> wo n't complete its investigation for months, but we feel a responsibility to the public to maintain confidence,'' <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> plans to lease planes to replace the three jetliners permanently removed from service. <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said the three jets would remain grounded until <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> officials are sure they are airworthy, then the airline will decide whether to sell or scrap them. `` Fortunately, <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> is a very financially strong airline,'' <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the night before <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s primary at a farmhouse, then urged family farmers today to join with urban factory workers to bring about change in the political system. `` Family farmers have become isolated from the political process,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters gathered on the front lawn of the rural home of <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> ca n't supply the economic nutrition to this country that family farmers can,'' he said, referring to the giant food and grain conglomerates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the night at the <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> home after a day of pre-primary campaigning in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. He also stayed at their home during the 1984 presidential campaign. Since then, the <PERSON> Laus </PERSON> have been forced by economic problems to auction their equipment, sell all but 10 acres and the nearly 100-year-old family home and have taken jobs in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>. After campaigning in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which also has its primary today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who trails Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in public opinion surveys, stood on a dumpster in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'s Hilltop housing project and declared: `` The polls, the pundits, the press will not determine who will win ... That's your decision.'' Monday's visit was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s second to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and his extra time in the state could help him at the polls Tuesday. The Democratic candidate who spends the most time in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> traditionally does well in the presidential primary in the mostly Republican state. Despite the 600-delegate gap that divides him <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was within striking distance of the nomination. To nominate, 2,081 delegates are needed. `` I have the longest legs, the strongest legs ... As the days get longer, the race gets stronger,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose day began around 4 a.m. in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, appeared tired and sounded somewhat hoarse. But he spoke at length, sounding his campaign themes of stopping drugs and promoting fair wages, fair prices and fair taxes. `` Let's stop playing urban and rural against each other,'' he said. `` We need each other. `` We need family farmers. They're the best stewards of our soil,'' he said, denouncing big agribusinesses. Walking through the housing project, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> carried first a little girl on his shoulders and then a little boy as the people crowded around him. Walking around the project, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was joined by actress <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, known for her role as <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> in the `` Superman'' movies. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later traveled to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for another rally. About 2,500 people, many not yet old enough to vote, packed a high school gym. `` Why are people here tonight? ... Hope has been reborn,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. When hope is reborn, `` it chases away our doubts and fears.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the nation `` does n't just need to change presidents, we need to change direction.''

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed a guerrilla in a clash in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today, the military command said. It was the first confirmed battle involving Israeli troops there since a two-day Israeli incursion last week left three soldiers and more than 40 Shiite Moslem guerrillas dead. No Israeli casualties were reported in today's clash, which occurred shortly after midnight near the village of <LOCATION> Taire </LOCATION> five miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. The military said the guerrilla was killed on the edge of the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> created when it withdrew most troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985 after a three-year occupation. The army said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers spotted a guerrilla squad that tried to infiltrate into the security zone and plant land mines on roads used by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. It said the guerrilla who was killed carried a rifle, a <LOCATION> Katyusha </LOCATION> rocket and two land mines. The army did not say to which group the guerrillas belonged.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Verification Problems Resolved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today he did not know what problems were holding up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the medium-range missile treaty. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, speaking to reporters after arriving in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for a meeting later this week with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, indicated the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had not made any new proposals to resolve the verification dispute which has arisen in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Basically the verification problems regarding the INF treaty have been resolved, I think,'' he said in answer to a reporter's question `` I'm not quite clear what the problems ... in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are. We have not been told yet.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side `` was asking certain questions, certain points of clarification'' on the verification issue. `` We answered those questions and we thought that there is no problem,'' he said. He said that on other questions, not dealing with verification, `` we have brought new ideas.'' He said the ideas were `` in all areas,'' but he did not elaborate. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet Communist Party chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed an agreement Dec. 8 to eliminate the two sides' medium and shorter-range nuclear weapons But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided Monday to delay consideration of the treaty, saying serious disagreements had arisen over verification, or anti-cheating measures. Senators looked to the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting to settle the dispute. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also said that he did not think the two sides would conclude an accord on reducing strategic, or intercontinental, nuclear arms before the scheduled <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit beginning May 29. But he said they could `` consolidate progress'' made since December. After the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instructed their arms control negotiators to try to complete a treaty on strategic missiles to be signed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the two sides have made progress since December, and will continue their work after his meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` If we are not able to complete an agreement before <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> we will continue after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the ministers would have to do `` a great deal of work'' during their two-day <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting in order to prepare documents for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. He predicted that meeting would `` summarize the very substantial'' work done since December `` and on the basis of that we shall determine the prospects of our work in the future.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would be their 26th since <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> took office July 2, 1985. He said the agenda would also include conventional weapons, nuclear testing, regional problems and bilateral issues.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, in his first full day in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most impoverished country, today criticized `` the abysmal differences between rich and poor countries'' and the profits made by banks on loans to Third World nations.

Earlier, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> met with diplomats at the papal nuncio's residence in the center of the city `` The abysmal differences between rich and poor countries are incompatible with divine designs of a just and equal sharing of the goods of creation,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. He said the underdevelopment of the Third World, and particularly its foreign debts, spawned social and political instability in many countries. `` The imbalance between the amount of this debt and the capacity to pay it, the difference between the sums loaned and the profits demanded by creditors, is causing very grave damage to many poor countries,'' he said. Thousands of people, including peasants in Indian dress and traditional bowler hats, greeted the pontiff at the La Paz airport after his arrival from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on Monday. He appealed to them `` not to lose hope.'' `` I will spend five days among you, sharing your aspirations, seeing first-hand this nation stricken by poverty and a lack of development and resources,'' he said. President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, who welcomed the pope, said in his speech that the visit would help bolster the flagging spirits of Bolivians. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, devastated by unemployment and crime, is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country. Its $ 4.2 billion foreign debt is about eight times its annual gross national product. `` You come at a time when <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is suffering bitter tests that could weaken its spirit or perhaps sink it into a state of desperation,'' the 80-year-old president said. On Monday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> addressed the country's 39 bishops, asking them to `` defend themselves against the proselytist activity of sects that, in recent times, are multiplying in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` These fundamentalist sects are sowing confusion among the people and, unfortunately, could very soon dilute the coherence and unity of the evangelical message,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. During the meeting, the 67-year-old pontiff seemed to tire. Bishop <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrazas </PERSON>, head of the Bolivian Episcopal conference, refrained from delivering his address to the pope because `` we see that the pope is tired.'' He handed the pontiff a copy of his speech, in which he says <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> suffers from `` a situation of injustice that consumes thousands of brothers in degrading misery and inhumane unemployment.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will visit seven Bolivian cities, ranging from the tin-mining center of <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, devastated by mine closures, to the lowland boom town of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a center of ranching, agriculture and cocaine trafficking. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s flourishing cocaine industry supplies an estimated one-third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the Eurpean market. The pope's South American tour, his ninth, began Friday in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and will take him to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, where he will spend his 68th birthday before returning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 18. The pontiff has made 37 pilgrimages abroad since he became head of the 800-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> nearly a decade ago.

 Airline delays in the area were said to be minimal today, but telephone outages were still widespread following a weekend fire that put callers and aircraft on hold. There is no relief in sight for some 35,000 telephone customers in western suburbs following the fire at a switching station in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> official said. Flights were delayed for two hours Monday at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> because air traffic controllers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s control center in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> had difficulty communicating with the O'Hare control tower, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said this morning. He said communications broke down because of the switching station fire and Sunday's storm, with its 80 mph winds. `` Right now, 12 of the 28 circuits are back in business. There's minimal -LRB- flight -RRB- delays,'' said <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> `` We anticipate that by Wednesday we'll have 100 percent of the circuits working.'' Midway, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s other airport, was affected by the communications problem and <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s delays had a ripple effect on airports in other cities, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. No immediate remedy is expected for the customers without telephone service, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` It's going to be sometime late this week That would be about the safest thing we could say.'' At <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, nurses were carrying walkie-talkies, ham radio operators were on hand to call doctors outside the area and a messenger service was set up to reach local physicians in emergencies. None of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s catalog-sales phones in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area were working and one of the company's stores in suburban <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> was without phone service Monday, said spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> for the Chicago-based retailer. The fire also forced a shutdown of off-track wagering on Monday's thoroughbred horse races at Sportsman's Park, although on-track betting was not affected. In <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> parked a bus with nine phones for emergency use and portable radio units were set up at schools, churches and major intersections in neighboring <LOCATION> Clarendon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, also for emergency use. Fire departments from 15 communities battled the fire at the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station, west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for three hours before it was brought under control Sunday evening. The cause of the fire is still unknown. The station houses computerized switching equipment that serves customers by connecting their local calls directly to the number dialed and routing long-distance calls. Customers in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Clarendon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> and unincorporated <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> were completely out of service, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Littel </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said phones were dead for 35,000 customers, but the number of consumers whose service was only partly interrupted was unknown.

 A defense attorney today asked jurors not to be `` bullied by public opinion'' when they consider the fate of a man accused of killing 16 people, while a prosecutor said in his opening statement that he would demand the death penalty. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> summarized in a 15-minute statement the crimes for which <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, is on trial. The retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant is accused of fatally shooting former co-worker <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, during a Dec. 28 rampage in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. Officials said Ms. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> spurned <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' advances a year before her death and that <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> was a chance victim. If convicted of murder, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> could be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole. In addition to two counts of murder, he is charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of kidnapping. Trial is set July 18 for the deaths of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife and 13 other relatives who were shot or strangled during the Christmas holidays before the shooting rampage. Their bodies were found on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' property, 47 miles east of <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> was shot four times in the head. He also said a woman wounded by <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was first shot in the head as she sat at a desk at a <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> business. After she fell, he said, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> went around the desk. `` He stood over and he fired another shot into her chest, near her heart,'' the prosecutor said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, during an 11-minute statement, asked jurors to consider variations in statements given by witnesses in describing the assailant. `` The defense asks that you not be bullied by public opinion, by what the press may say or by what the public may say,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. Police Chief <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, the first witness, explained the order of the shootings at four Russellvile businesses and identified <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> as the man who handed him one of the .22 - caliber revolvers the police say was used in the The trial in the two deaths was moved here after the defense said pretrial publicity prevented selection of an impartial jury in <LOCATION> Pope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. During the six hours it took to pick the jury Monday, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> murmured to his attorneys and chatted with reporters covering the case, asking for copies of their news stories. Security at the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse was tight, with up to 10 officers inside the courtroom. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> objected after prospective juror <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> of Ozark told Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, `` I know too much. I've been working down around <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> a little bit. I've got my mind already made up.'' As the judge ordered <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> to stop talking, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> moved for rejection of the panel of prospective jurors and a mistrial. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> denied the motions, saying no harm had been done. The state struck seven jurors and the defense only one. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> excused nine others, generally because they said they already believed <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was guilty. Asked whether he could be impartial, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, 48, of Ozark replied, `` As much as I've seen and heard, it may be hard to do, but I'll do my best.'' <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> that community sentiment was that the death penalty would be appropriate for <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, but promised to return a verdict of innocent if not convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt `` I have to make unpopular decisions every day,'' said <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He was seated. The slayings made nationwide news, but the trial appeared to be having little effect on this northwest <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> town of 3,600. Most of the spectators in the courtroom Monday were reporters. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clary </PERSON>, 18, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said she was unaware of the trial until she heard classmates say their parents were among those summoned for possible jury duty. `` People are taking it in stride,'' Miss <PERSON> Clary </PERSON> said. `` It's a big topic in town,'' she added. `` People have strong opinions about the guy and what he did in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>.''

 An effort to save money by closing unneeded military bases is `` the stickiest wicket'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said today Senators discussed whether to give the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authority to close bases, with many legislators loath to shut down facilities and lose jobs in their states. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, reflecting the political sensitivity of the issue, said the plan was `` the stickiest wicket in this bill.'' The bill includes a provision creating a seven-member commission that would recommend by Dec. 31 which of the 3,800 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations could be shut down. The proposal is an attempt to circumvent congressional opposition to shutting bases. The military has not closed any major bases since 1977, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> erected a series of stiff rules. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say that between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion a year could be saved if unneeded installations were closed. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, noting the proposed base-closing commission does n't include any legislators, has suggested increasing the panel to 13 The other six members would all be <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or House members, including <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` The way this is written would given absolute power to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said, `` the publics in our communities rely on these bases ... when and if we close any bases, it better not look political. Adding legislators `` is the best way to give this credibility,'' he said. Between 1961 and 1977, the Pentagon closed or reduced 3,600 installations, saving an estimated $ 5 billion a year. But because of the legal roadblocks erected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, none have been closed since then. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has even given up formally proposing base closures because of the strong Capitol Hill opposition. Last week, in announcing the seven-member commission, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted that `` some have suggested that this may be an exercise in futility.'' The proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill will be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as separate legislation. As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began work on the bill Monday, the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> warned that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending probably wo n't be increased for several years unless federal budget problems are solved. The bill authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 299.5 billion in fiscal 1989, about the same amount permitted in the current year. The bill would provide the fourth consecutive year of little or no increase in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending after the large increases during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. The bill's spending total was part of the so-called budget summit last December between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders as part of the drive to reduce federal spending. That is about $ 33 billion less than the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> thought it would have next year. The reductions were ordered by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who approved cuts in personnel and the entire retirement of some weapons, including 16 aging <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigates. The bill that eventually passes the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be reconciled with the separate <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will consider later this week. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spent two weeks voting on its measure and is scheduled to finally approve the bill on Wednesday. While both bills provide $ 299.5 billion, there are a number of major differences. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure proposes $ 3.5 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, compared with the $ 4.6 billion figure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought $ 4.8 billion.

 Death row inmate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wants his execution to proceed as planned Wednesday morning, but his mother wants the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule he is n't competent to select death over life. Attorneys representing <PERSON> Alexine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> filed an appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied an execution stay, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> attorney general. The state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> planned to file a response with the high court today, after which the justices would consider the case, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> today requested `` Rhaeakunda dirt'' for his final meal, a request <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> officials said would not be honored. `` It's not food, it's not sanitary,'' prison spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunnelee </PERSON> said. `` He'll be offered something off the regular prison menu.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, was convicted in the 1983 robbery-slaying of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance office manager. Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, claims her son is mentally incompetent. Telephone messages left at the office and home of Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Donley </PERSON>, were not returned Monday evening. Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, reached at her <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> home Monday afternoon, said she was unaware of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ruling, and said she was n't sure what legal strategy would be followed. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has no attorney and has resisted any attempts for legal help from capital punishment opponents. `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> does n't want to be represented,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlassen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Punishment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` He has n't asked for our help.'' <PERSON> McGlassen </PERSON> said the execution should not be carried out because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering a challenge to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death penalty statute. Since the high court agreed to hear the case of death row inmate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, inmates routinely have won stays of execution. A decision in the <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> case is expected soon. Convicted killer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Streetman </PERSON>, who also asked to be put to death, is the only inmate executed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> so far this year. `` The man has a right to make his own choice,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general. `` If he wants to file an appeal, I'm not going to deprive a man of his day in court. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former tarot card dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> who was working as a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> taxi driver, was convicted for the 1983 shooting death of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>. Testimony at his trial showed he was tackled by witnesses while fleeing the shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was linked to the Rohus slaying. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> repeatedly has said he is innocent, but says he does not want to spend the rest of his life withering away on death row. He also has accused death penalty opponents of caring little for him personally while urging him to seek a stay to further their own philosophical goals. If he receives lethal injection, he will be the 28th prisoner executed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the 99th nationally since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, a Socialist known for his appeal to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s political center, was chosen today by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to succeed conservative <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> as premier. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, defeated Sunday when <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> swept to re-election to a new seven-year term, visited the presidential <LOCATION> Elysee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> to submit his resignation, ending two years of an uneasy power-sharing between a conservative premier and Socialist president. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, made a terse announcement about 2 -LCB- hours later, saying only the 57-year-old <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> would be the new premier and providing no details of who would serve in the Cabinet. The new premier will be expected to invite non-Socialists into the Cabinet to demonstrate an appeal beyond the party's boundaries. Because <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> still has support of the center-right majority coalition in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the constitution did not require him to step down and the president could not dismiss him. But there was never any doubt <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> would quit following his defeat at the polls. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won re-election with 54 percent of the vote to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s 46 percent. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> always has been rated among the most popular politicians in public opinion polls. He is known for stating his opinions whether or not they coincided with his party's. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> resigned as agriculture minister in the Socialist government of Premier <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON> in 1985, saying he could not support a change to a new system of electing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that distributed seats among parties based on their proportion of the vote. The Socialists control just 211 seats in the 577-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, so the new premier will need to form either a firm coalition with centrist forces, or make temporary alliances on particular issues. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also could dissolve the body and call new elections, but he has said he would do so only if his first government loses a vote of confidence. The center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which teamed up with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic in the government for the past two years, said in a statement that it would not automatically vote to censure the new government. It said it would judge the new premier's proposals on their individual merits. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said its leader, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, `` has become at this hour the de facto leader of the national and popular opposition to organize the <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people against socialism.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> drew a surprising 14.4 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election on April 24, when <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> won just 19.9 percent and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> received 34.1 percent.

 Four of Wall Street's biggest firms said today they had indefinitely suspended a highly profitable computerized method of trading stocks because of widespread criticism that it is causing volatility and destroying investor confidence. The announcements by <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> came amid an uproar about so-called index-arbitrage program trading and a protracted slump in the stock market since the October crash nearly seven months ago. The firms' actions came a week after the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> intensified post-crash limits on program trading, blamed for causing enormous swings in stock prices for reasons unrelated to underlying values. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> are among the most significant users of the technique, which uses high-volume computers to sell stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and buy equivalent stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, or vice versa, to profit from fleeting price disparities. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> is considered a smaller user of program trading. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Painewebber </ORGANIZATION> said they were suspending the technique as of today for their own accounts although they would continue to do it for customers if requested. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said it had suspended the technique for its own account as well as customer accounts as of last Thursday, but did n't publicize it until the other firms made announcements today. `` I think it's certainly a move in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, head of commodities and financial futures at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's meaningul because at least there's beginning to be an acknowledgment to the public perception that program trading causes turbulence.'' Large numbers of investors have complained to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and their brokers that program trading has compelled them to get out of stocks because they believe it has made the market more like a gambling casino. Brokers also are growing resentful of the relatively small number of program traders. Moreover, there is a belief in the securities industry that lawmakers will take severe legislative action aimed at restoring investor confidence unless brokerage firms can find ways to reform themselves. `` We have decided to suspend any non-customer-related index arbitrage activity with the goal of furthering the serious analysis of the role of index arbitrage in market volatility,'' <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marron </PERSON>, said in a statement. `` It is our hope that all interest regulators and market participants work together in an objective manner to find an intelligent and mutually acceptable solution to this issue.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that his firm `` will abstain from all domestic stock index propriatary arbitrage for the present time.'' `` It is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace,'' he said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said in a statement that `` the efforts of our industry, the exchanges, the regulators and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be directed towards expanding liquidity, reducing volatility and restoring public confidence in the equity markets.'' `` We have no present intention of starting again. That does n't mean we wo n't do it again,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>' chairman and chief executive, said in an answer to a telephone `` The profit is greatly overstated. If everybody thinks it's so important -LRB- to stop -RRB-, we'll give in to it.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty has `` been put on the back burner'' until there is a resolution of complaints of alleged <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> backsliding on inspection provisions, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said today. The White House said it supported the delay. `` It could be resolved in a matter of hours, in a matter of days, or it might never be resolved,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat, told reporters. The dispute could be settled quickly, but probably only if Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> offers concessions when he meets with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> later this week. `` The Soviets can resolve this fast,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. `` The thing that can expedite this is for the administration and the Soviets to sit down and close these loopholes.'' `` We do n't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' he said. `` This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> takes up the treaty.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration backs the delay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate. `` We feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action,'' he said. `` There is unanimity between the administration and the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership that these problems should be satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification.'' `` The administration has made clear to the Soviets the need for an expeditious solution,'' he said. Assistant Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., emerging from a morning meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he was confident the problems can be surmounted `` We have much to do in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. We have the three or four issues to resolve. We're ready to do that,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> told reporters outside the White House. `` We're all very interested in what will take place with Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. I think that they will do their usual good job of splicing things back together again.'' `` We just hope that there are only misunderstandings on verification and that after the Shultz-Shevardnadze talks, it'll be clear that the INF treaty has some on-site provisions there that are mutually agreed to,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the president is pushing anybody. He wants clarification of what we all meant,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, arriving in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the talks, said that, `` basically the verification problems ... have been resolved, I think. I'm not quite clear what the problems ... in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are. We have not been told yet.'' The foreign minister said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` was asking certain questions, certain points of clarification'' on the verification issue. `` We answered those questions and we thought that there is no problem,'' he said. A pall is certain to be cast over the planned <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> if the treaty dispute is not resolved by the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrives in the Soviet capital on May 29. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had wanted to take a ratified treaty to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a signing ceremony, but the delay may make that impossible, even if the dispute itself is resolved by then. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> announced Monday that he was indefinitely postponing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty. Debate had tentatively been set to begin Wednesday. After conferring with other senators and White House officials, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said a serious dispute over verification issues had arisen and added: `` This treaty will not be brought up until these problems are resolved. It is obvious that not only have the problems that had previously surfaced not been resolved but that new problems have arisen,'' he said. `` I think it behooves the Soviets to come forward with solutions and permit the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to open the debate with our eyes open,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to walk off a cliff.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he will not reschedule debate until assured by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees that satisfactory on-site inspection procedures have been agreed to by the Soviets in writing and that other problems also have been resolved. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> acted after a meeting between senators and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. Leaving the meeting, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> expressed approval of the decision, saying, `` not a bad course of action.'' The pact, the product of difficult negotiations dating to the beginning of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1981, was signed amid widespread celebration at last December's Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting here. It requires the elimination of all ground-launched missiles with a range of from 300 to 3,400 miles. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, the vice chairman, said they were surprised at the timing and nature of the Soviet action They said there are about 10 outstanding and unresolved verification issues. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said the Soviets are apparently adamant `` beyond their usual bargaining stance.'' `` To have the Soviets ... reneging is very alarming to me,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` There is some real perverseness here.'' He said Soviet officials have `` turned us down flatly'' on some verification issues previously thought to have been settled while adopting a position of `` deliberate ambiguity'' on others. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> speculated that the Soviets are attempting to use leverage in the days before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit `` to get what they could n't get at the bargaining table. `` This will either be resolved quickly or it wo n't be resolved at all,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The verification dispute centers mostly on access of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitors to Soviet missile plants and sites. The Soviets are trying to restrict inspection of missile containers to those large enough to carry an entire rocket. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the right to examine smaller containers that could carry a missile stage. Secondly, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, the Soviets are trying to place off limits parts of areas designated for inspection. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last month asked the Soviets for an explanation. Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> delivered <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s reply to the department Sunday night. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials then briefed the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` We do n't consider the Soviet response to our questions fully satisfactory,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` There's more work to be done.''

<HEAD>Reagan Spurred to Tax Reform by Anecdote About His Secretary's
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, always a soft touch for a personal anecdote, was convinced of the need to radically overhaul the nation's tax law when told that his secretary paid more in taxes than 60 of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> writes in his new book. The president's former treasury secretary and ex-chief of staff takes much of the credit for passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, considered the major domestic achievement of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. In `` For the Record,'' which went on sale Monday, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> writes that the idea of simplifying the tax code by closing loopholes and lowering tax rates was moribund when he took the cause to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a White House meeting in late 1983. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> liked to start every meeting off with a story or a joke. So, as a way of introducing the subject, I asked him a question about his old employer, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` What does <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> have in common with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and 57 other big corporations?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, remembering fondly his days as a goodwill ambassador for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, smiled and leaned forward for the punchline, only to be told, `` What these outfits have in common is that not one of them pays a penny in taxes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government. ... Your secretary paid more in federal taxes last year than all of those giant companies put together.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> describes the president as shocked and flushed with anger by this news, saying he did n't realize things had gotten that far out of line. While capturing the president's attention on this occasion, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says he often failed in getting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to focus on critical economic issues, especially during the first term when <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> served as treasury secretary. He describes an administration torn apart by internal squabbles over huge budget deficits while the president remained remote and detached. As treasury secretary, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he was `` flying by the seat of my pants.'' `` The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and reading the newspapers,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says. He said that during four years as treasury secretary, he never met alone with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to discuss the president's economic philosophy, and the orders he received from aides such as <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> III seldom quoted the president or referred to his thoughts. `` I found this disembodied relationship bizarre,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` For a while I struggled against a certain anxiety that this method of running the world's greatest economy might wreck the new presidency.'' While crediting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with creating `` an atmosphere of confidence,'' that helped in the recovery from the 1981-82 recession, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said `` the president himself had very little to do with the invention and the implementation of the policies'' that came to be called `` Reaganomics.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> mentions frequent battles during the first term with former budget director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>; former White House chief of staff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>; <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s assistant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>; as well as presidential economists <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>. The others favored tax increases to lower the budget deficits while <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> remained adamantly opposed, threatening to resign on one occasion if the president accepted their recommendation. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> often clashed over <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>'s belief that the president would have to accept tax increases or run the risk that the federal deficit would balloon out of control. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> in his own tell-all book published in 1986 said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had given the president `` unlimited bad advice for years and years by essentially echoing and telling the president what he wants to hear.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> was criticized by <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> for unsettling financial markets and prolonging the recession by his traits of `` Delphic mysteriousness and a bureaucratic fascination with tinkering.'' In contrast to the harsh depiction of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the rest of the book for her use of astrology and her behind-the-throne power, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says the first came to his aid in 1982 at a time when he had been shunted aside in the economic decision-making process by <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> and others. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called him to find out how he had answered a letter from her stepbrother, Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, concerning the health of the savings and loan industry. The discussion then moved to <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s general views on the economy <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> quotes Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> was greedy for funds for the military and had no idea he was hurting the economy. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she felt the president needed to hear <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s views `` I'll have <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> put you on the schedule to see him,'' she is quoted as saying.

 Concern over rising inflation and foot-dragging among bureaucrats could scuttle <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambitious reform program and trigger a return to Soviet-style central planning, a leading economist warned Tuesday. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Yining </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the main threat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic development is not its 11-percent annual inflation rate, but the possibility that officials will halt reforms to control the price rises. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who spent six years in labor reform camps during the 1960s and 1970s because he questioned central planning, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s prosperity depends on letting the market determine prices and making independent entrepreneurs and family farmers the backbone of the economy `` The danger is that the need to stabilize the economic situation will be used to bring back the traditional system,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> news conference. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` should n't be afraid of small price rises,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s backward economy has grown rapidly in the past decade due to market-style economic reforms introduced by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. As the government has gradually lifted its decade-old central controls, however, prices have soared, generating widespread public discontent. The government said retail prices rose an average of 11 percent in the first quarter of 1988, compared with 7.3 percent for all of 1987 and 6 percent in 1986. The jump has been even higher in large cities, where price increases have soared as high as 19 percent. Prices of non-staple foods have risen 30 percent in some places over the past year. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said he agreed with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'s statement that increasing supply of high-demand goods is the best solution. He said he supported the government's recent decision to lift price controls on more items, including pork, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s staple meat, and to give urban consumers direct subsidies to compensate for price rises. But he said price reform should be carried out gradually over a six - to 10-year period Immediate de-control of all prices would fuel inflation and lead to a run on bank deposits as price rises outstripped bank interest rates, he said. The second threat to reform, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, is resistance among local officials and enterprises who `` only know the old ways, and find it hard to change.'' He said the government `` needs to improve its propaganda work. We must tell ordinary people that in the past they had stable prices under conditions of poverty.'' Socialism must be based on a commodity economy, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said _ one in which the market determines prices and allocation of materials and labor. `` As long as the economy prospers and living standards are raised, our purpose is fulfilled,'' he added. `` People will see that socialism is not connected with poverty but wealth.'' Asked about the need for democratic reforms to accompany economic change, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, `` Socialist democracy ... ca n't develop overnight.

 A man who was sentenced to death 14 years ago for the murders of a south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> family was given six life sentences at his retrial today after a judge ruled jurors were hopelessly deadlocked over the death penalty. The <ORGANIZATION> DeKalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury had deliberated into a seventh day without reaching a unanimous verdict in the sentencing phase of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s retrial. Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> declared the jury deadlocked at 10:20 a.m. today and sentenced <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> to six consecutive life terms in prison. Life is the automatic sentence when a jury fails to agree on the death penalty. <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles, said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is immediately eligible for parole consideration, and that the board probably will consider the case next month. If parole is denied, he said, the board can wait up to eight years before hearing the case again. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the case is covered by a 1964 law requiring parole consideration after an inmate has served no more than seven years of a life sentence. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has been in jail since 1973. Defense attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said he doubted he would appeal either the sentence or the verdict. `` We feel that it's a vindication of the right to a fair trial. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>'s had a fair trial for the first time. `` We can only assume that if <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> had had a fair trial 15 years ago, he would have gotten a life sentence,'' he said. Eleven members of the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family and <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Godby </PERSON>, who originally investigated the murders, were present when the sentence was announced. The family members broke into tears. `` We've done our part. We'll just have to live with their decision,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the oldest daughter of victim <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>. She said the family, which has watched the trial since testimony began in April, would immediately head home to <LOCATION> Donalsonville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> told the jury, `` The court understands that you would have preferred to reach a unanimous verdict, but you should not feel bad that you have not.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was one of three men sentenced to death in 1974 for the May 14, 1973, slayings of <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>; his brother <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>'s sons <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The men were shot to death in <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>'s mobile home near <LOCATION> Donalsonville </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> was killed in a nearby field after she was repeatedly raped. The convictions of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> were thrown out in 1985 by a federal appeals court that cited pretrial publicity. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was convicted a second time in January and again condemned to die. <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> is to be retried later in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury, which found <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> guilty of six counts of murder on May 2, had been deliberating his sentence since last Wednesday. The jury resumed deliberations today after a brief interruption while the judge interviewed jurors who heard a remark about <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> while eating breakfast at a restaurant. Court officials said a customer told one juror, `` He's guilty,'' and the juror repeated the remark. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> told the jurors the comment was improper and should have no effect on their impartiality. During the lengthy sentencing deliberations, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> refused repeated motions by <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s attorneys to declare the jury deadlocked. <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, case monitor for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s Capital Litigation Project, said the length of the deliberations was unusual, possibly unprecedented, in the sentencing phase of a trial in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` The longest I can recollect in 10 years of handling cases like this is about 15 hours over a three-day period,'' she said. Relatives of the six <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> victims spoke to reporters Monday for the first time since the retrials began. `` It's been awful hard. We've been waiting for 15 years to see justice,'' said <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> and mother of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>. She said faith in God has sustained the family. `` He's going to be the judge.''

 COLLONGES-BELLERIVE, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat released last week from captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, met Tuesday with the sister of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> for a private conversation about <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>'s three years as a hostage. Carton, 64, was protocol officer at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped March 22, 1985 by pro-Iranian extremists. He was freed May 4 along with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, and French journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, 44. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has been waging a campaign to keep the hostage issue in the public eye as part of an effort to win the release of her brother, the longest-held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, is the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985. Mrs. Say met on Monday with <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and hoped to see <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` My feelings are mixed because it is always difficult, especially hearing the stories of how the French were brutalized,'' she said. `` But on the other hand, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is alive and it has reinforced my determination to work toward his release. `` I know I am doing what he is counting on me to do.'' <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> said he felt well, but that his condition was weak and he still has trouble walking. He met with Mrs. Say in the garden of the home of his daughter in this <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> suburb. `` I was encouraged that he seemed in reasonably good health,'' Mrs. Say said. `` He was very concerned about the hostages left behind, so we agreed that our conversation be kept absolutely private.'' Referring to her talks with <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and other members of his family, she said: `` He, like <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, was adamant that public pressure to get the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to work for the hostages' release was the only way that they would ever gain freedom _ that their cause must be kept in the public eye, that by keeping the issue alive, we are keeping the hostages alive.'' There are 18 hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight other Americans in addition to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> sipped two cups of tea made from coca leaves to help ward off altitude sickness in this sky-high city, a bishop said Tuesday. The pontiff, who arrived Monday night, was given `` mate de coca'', or coca tea, aboard the Bolivian <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 that brought him here from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Terraza </PERSON>, president of the local Episcopal conference. `` He drank it again before he went to bed,'' <PERSON> Terrazas </PERSON> said. `` He asked for it. It helps.'' Coca leaves are used to make cocaine, which is illegal in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. It is legal, however, to chew or brew the leaves, which provide a mild stimulus. The leaves are considered an effective folk remedy for altitude sickness. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has a flourishing cocaine industry despite government efforts to stop it. Local officials said the pope, an alpine skier, had help up well under the altitude. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, at 11,930 feet above sea level, is the highest capital in the world and many tourists are stricken with dizziness, sleeplessness and headaches. On Tuesday, the pontiff gave a mass in a city suburb called `` el alto'' -LRB- the heights -RRB-, 13,150 feet above sea level. Asked if the pope had been affected by the altitude, <PERSON> Terrazas </PERSON> said: `` Yes, a little bit, it seems.

 A malnourished 7-year-old boy who escaped after spending up to four years in a bathroom prison has gone to a foster home carrying dozens of gifts from well-wishers, authorities said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Taub </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>'s doctors decided that 25-pound <PERSON> Vannoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> needed `` privacy, some love and some food and a good diet'' more than additional hospital treatment, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

 A time bomb hidden in a briefcase exploded in the foreign-exchange area of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s main <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> branch Tuesday, killing one person and wounding 14, police reported. The midday explosion blew out most of the American bank's windows and caused extensive damage to the floor, ceiling and furniture Shards of smoke-colored window glass, and pieces of human flesh, littered the sidewalk. No one claimed responsibility. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in the Indian capital. All the victims were Indians and two of the wounded were in serious condition, officials said. The dead man was identified as <PERSON> Satish </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaudhry </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Noida </LOCATION>, a town east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> headquarters office opened late last year on the third floor of a new, 12-story office building in downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The red sandstone structure overlooks the Connaught Circle shopping arcade. Dr. <PERSON> Saroj </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manohar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said most of the injured suffered cuts and leg injuries. <PERSON> Maryann </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, an embassy spokeswoman, said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has advised its employees and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to take security precautions.'' She did not elaborate. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Karan </PERSON> told a news conference: `` We do not rule out the hands of foreign terrorist organizations. We are reviewing security arrangements for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies and individuals.'' <PERSON> Karan </PERSON> said the bomb, apparently hidden in a fiberglass briefcase, was similar to one that exploded in a staircase leading to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> office in downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in August 1986. No one was injured in that bombing. He said Sikhs would not have planted the bomb because `` they do not use such devices.'' Sikh extremists have fought for an independent homeland in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> for more than five years, and thousands of people have been killed. A bomb threat was telephoned to another <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> branch at about 3:30 p.m. but the telephone call was a hoax, <PERSON> Karan </PERSON> said. Officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> employees' union criticized bank security. K.L. <PERSON> Malhotra </PERSON>, union president, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> agency as saying the bank hired contract guards rather than employing its own. He claimed that `` contravenes <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> police guidelines for strengthening security at all bank branches.'' The explosion tore a hole two inches deep and 18 inches in diameter in the bank's pink marble floor. A witness, who asked that his name not be used, said the bank was crowded with people waiting in line for tellers. It appeared that comparatively little damage was done outside the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> office. Nearly all windows on other floors remained intact. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> vice president and corporate officer for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said five of the wounded were bank employees. He said the `` branch was damaged quite extensively, but we expect to be back in operation within 48 hours.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the bank is a branch of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banking company.

 Oregon's traditional unkindness to front-runners could give <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pause and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> encouragement as they head west for the next primary on the long campaign trail. Both Democrats will be campaigning in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> this week, seeking a share of the 45 national convention delegates at stake next Tuesday and also hoping to gain momentum for the primary season's big finale in neighboring <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also will be in the state this weekend, even though he has sewn up the Republican nomination. There are 32 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates at stake in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. A statewide poll in mid-April showed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the national front-runner, as the favorite among Oregon Democrats. He had support from 48 percent compared to 28 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibbitts </PERSON> has said that even if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> receives only 25 percent to 30 percent of the vote in the primary, it would be a good showing for a black candidate in a state that's less than 2 percent black If history is any guide, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> should n't be taken for granted by anyone. `` A number of candidates have had the wheels taken off their bandwagon when they got to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Grattan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerans </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> who's a consultant for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voters in the 1984 Democratic primary handed a lopsided victory to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> even though <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was the established front-runner nationally. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> went on to win in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, though <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> eventually won the Democratic nomination. Indeed, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Democrats in four of the past nine presidential primaries have given victories to presidential candidates who failed to win their party's nomination. `` Oregon has been described as a maverick state, and that's probably true,'' <PERSON> Kerans </PERSON> said `` You have people who are removed geographically from political power centers, and they look at things from their own perspective.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, beginning a three-day <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> swing on Tuesday, is the first presidential candidate to visit the state this year, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is planning stops on Thursday and possibly Saturday. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp in particular views <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s primary as important because it directly precedes the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. A good showing by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a heavily white, Western state would show that he has broad appeal and would give him a big boost right before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a campaign aide said. `` If the people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> see <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> do well in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, we hope they will take their cue from that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a national field coordinator for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We're spending a lot of time here to send a message to the other Western states.'' During their visits to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plan to spend much of their time in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has events in <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> appearances Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to travel to <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> and tentatively plans to take part in events in <LOCATION> Eugene </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s suburban high-tech center, on Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to campaign in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Friday and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> on Saturday.

<HEAD>Wayne Williams Gets Parole Review</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles is reviewing the case of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, convicted of two murders in a series of killings of young black people, in preparation for his first parole hearing. Board spokesman <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the five-member board received the file this week, and would announce its decision in early June. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 29, was convicted Feb. 27, 1982, of murdering two of 29 young blacks who were killed in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> from 1979 to 1981. He was sentenced to life in prison. Police later blamed him for an additional 22 slayings, although he was not charged in them. Under <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law, all inmates serving life sentences must be considered for parole after seven years in prison. It is unlikely <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will be released, said parole board member <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON>. `` With any multiple murder case, it would be almost inconceivable that they would be paroled after the seven-year mark,'' he said. `` In most instances, that would put serious consideration -LRB- for parole -RRB- a long way off in the future.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' attorneys, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' hope for freedom is based on a successful appeal of his convictions, not parole. The appeal is pending in <LOCATION> Butts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is an inmate at the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Diagnostic and Classification Center.

 A jury today acquitted reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and eight associates on all charges in the 1984 slaying of gang rival <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> raised his right hand in a near salute and grinned at the jury as it returned the verdicts. Spectators in the packed courtroom cheered and shouted. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, 59, and the other eight defendants were being tried for the Sept. 14, 1984, murder of <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>. His body, with two bullets in the head, was found trussed and wrapped in a blanket in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> woods. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> faces charges in two other murders. He was convicted last year of conspiring with a former city councilman to extort $ 1 million from a waterfront developer. He is serving 14 years in prison on that conviction. When forewoman <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Minze </PERSON> said, `` Not guilty,'' to the charge of conspiracy involving defendant <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>, the courtroom erupted with a roar and some cheered. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> warned that if the outburst continued he would clear the courtroom. The crowd quieted after <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, cautioned `` It's not over yet'' and Ms. <PERSON> Minze </PERSON> resumed reading the verdict. On all counts _ first-degree murder, conspiracy and possession of an instrument of a crime _ she said, `` Not guilty.'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, who had prosecuted the two-month trial, asked that the jury be polled. As the name of each defendant was called, and on each count, jurors affirmed the verdicts. When that was completed, the defendants stood and embraced their lawyers, and waved happily to their families and the jury as the eight women and four men who considered their fate left the courtroom. `` I love the American judicial system,'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told a reporter outside the courtroom. The younger <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> had been in the second-floor City Hall courtroom since the trial began in March. Police allege that the elder <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> ran the Philadelphia-southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Mafia family from his home in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, before his arrest in the unrelated extortion case in 1986. Besides <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, the defendants were his nephew, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, identified during the trial as the mob's underboss; <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ventnor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Philadelphians </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> `` Wayne'' Grande, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pungitore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannarella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Scafidi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannece </PERSON> The jury got the case Monday after arguments from <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, who attacked two former gangsters who were key prosecution witnesses, and from Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, who conceded that the informants, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON>, were despicable and talked only after they were marked for death. Outside the courtroom today, <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said it was the second trial in a row in which the defense beat prosecutors who used <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> and DelGiorno. The two also also were the star prosecution witnesses when <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and four associates were acquitted in December of 20 federal drug charges. `` This is the second time that a jury did n't listen to the lies of <LOCATION> Caramandi </LOCATION> and DelGiorno,'' <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said. `` It is a signal to the whole country that you just do n't persecute people because of their alleged associations and activities. If they come at us again, we will hit them even harder.'' Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> left the courtroom after the verdict, avoiding reporters. The informants testified that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> gave the order to kill <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> because <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was threatening <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s control of the mob and because <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> broke his engagement to the daughter of one of <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s top lieutenants. Caramandi and <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was murdered in a closed south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> candy store. <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was lured by his best friend, <PERSON> Pungitore </PERSON>, to the store, where <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> pumped two bullets into <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s head. The two witnesses said <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s body was transported in a van to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where it was dumped along a road.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> battled <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> on Tuesday in low-intensity primary skirmishes along the way to a final showdown next month in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heavily favored to capture both contests and a majority of the 62 delegates at stake, thus reinforcing the impression that he is the Democratic nominee in all but name. Neither primary generated much excitement, in part because there seemed little suspense about the outcome but also because hotly contested statewide races overshadowed the presidential contest. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the Republican winner in advance on primary ballots in both states _ as usual. The vice president, who has clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination and has no active opposition in the remaining primary states, looked forward to receiving the endorsement of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in contrast, was several hundred delegates ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but several hundred shy of the total needed to claim the Democratic nomination. Aides expressed confidence he would command a nominating majority by the time the primary season ends on June 7 with elections in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and two other states, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has begun campaigning with one eye on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the other on the fall campaign against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had 1,522 delegates, to 935 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It takes 2,081 to claim the nomination. The week's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries offered a breather in the schedule after a rapid-fire series of industrial state contests ending last week in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and pointing the way toward contests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> next week and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in early June. Neither Democratic contender spent much time or devoted much advertising money to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ and their campaigns were overshadowed by fierce gubernatorial and senatorial primaries. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, incumbent Republican Gov. Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> faced a stiff primary challenge from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, while Democrats picked an opponent to run against the survivor. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Republicans chose between appointed Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Former Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> sought the Democratic nomination to oppose the winner. Neither <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seemed to mind that the presidential race was at a pause. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, the nomination seemingly within his grasp, took a weekend off for the first time in months. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> devoted part of his week to campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he plans a costly and intensive effort to slow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' drive toward the nomination. Over the last six weeks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has put together an impressive series of primary vitories in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, forcing all his rivals but one from the race and leaving <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> far behind in the hunt for delegates. At the same time, party leaders have begun to swing behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and treat him as the nominee-in-waiting, but also hope to avoid antagonizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the millions of black voters who sustained his candidacy.

 A federal investigation concluded today that the crew's failure to follow a required preflight check list caused the crash last August of a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet during takeoff at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. A total of 156 people were killed in the crash, the nation's second worst commercial aviation accident The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that the crew of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight 255 did not properly set the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-80's flaps and slats to give the plane adequate lift for takeoff. The devices were not set because the crew did not follow required checklist procedures as the plane prepared for takeoff, the board said. The finding immediately was criticized by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which promised to conduct further investigations into the Aug. 16, l987, accident. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators -RRB- fell short,'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a union member and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> pilot who took part in the investigation, told reporters after the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s official probable cause was approved. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was one of the union's representatives in the investigation. The pilots group has maintained that it is possible a mechanical problem could have caused the flaps and slats to be in improper positions. The safety board also cited as a contributing factor to the accident the failure of an alarm system to warn the crew that the plane was not configured properly for takeoff. Investigators have said that the alarm did not sound because it was not receiving electrical power, but the board concluded `` the reason for the absence of electrical power could not be determined.'' Earlier in the day, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators had told the board that they had discovered a small amount of tarnish on the circuit breaker, but not enough to interfere with the flow of electricity. They also had no evidence of a voltage surge that might have popped the breaker or any conclusive evidence that it might have been intentionally pulled by either the flight crew or maintenance workers. One investigator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Laynor </PERSON>, said, `` The evidence, we felt, was overwhelming ... that the aircraft did indeed attempt to take off with the flaps retracted.'' The board's hearing began with a dramatic computerized graphic simulation of the Aug. 16 crash. The simulation, in the form of a 16-minute videotape, traces the plane's taxiing as it prepared to leave the airport. The exchanges between the pilot and airport tower could be heard; conversation inside the cockpit was graphically superimposed on the television screen. The simulation showed that almost immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-80 lifted off from the runway it began to have problems, dipping first to the left, then the right, then left and right again while at the same time veering away from the runway. In a sequence that took only seconds, the plane finally dipped sharply to the left and almost rolled over, hitting a light post and than part of a building before crashing onto a highway. `` I've got a crash on the airport. Airport's closed,'' a controller could be heard saying. The pilot of flight 255 was Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maus </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The copilot was <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION>, Ill. Since the crash, pilot groups, the airline and the plane's manufacturer have offered sharply different versions of what they believe went wrong But the central issues of the accident have been known for months. Examination of the data recorder showed that the plane's wing flaps were fully retracted when they should have been extended 11 degrees. The slats in the front part of the wing also were retracted. Such a configuration of the wing's control surfaces sharply inhibited the twin-engine jet's ability to gain lift. The plane rose no more than 50 feet off the ground. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> argued that the pilot and copilot were to blame because of a `` casual attitude'' during a preflight checklist and their alleged failure to set the flaps properly. The manufacturer also accused the crew of pulling a circuit breaker to the alarm system so that it would not go off. No specific evidence supporting that allegation has been produced. Northwest blamed the failure of the flap warning system and maintained there was evidence that the breaker had been `` tarnished'' so as not to give an alarm. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that some tarnish was found on the breaker, but contends that did not keep it from sounding. The pilots union, to which both of the pilots belonged, pointed to previous problems with the flap mechanism on the plane. In any case, the pilots union rejected suggestions that the warning system was disabled by the flight crew and suggested _ as did <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ that a flaw in the circuit breaker prevented the alarm from sounding. The crash was the second worst commercial aviation accident in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, ranking behind only the May 1979 crash of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that killed 275.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent scant time campaigning in either state, devoting less than 24 hours combined to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Aides said his campaign spent less than $ 50,000 on television advertising in the two states. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor took shots at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the issue of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug activities, and collected a stream of endorsements from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. He won the support of seven governors during the week as he pushed his delegate advantage over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to nearly 600. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also spent considerable time dealing with his state's looming budget crunch _ a test of his campaign claim that he is a forceful leader who is not afraid to make tough decisions. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent parts of two days in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and parts of three in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, but his advisers conceded they had little hope of derailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in either state. Instead, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent part of the past week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, his last plausible chance to slow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and directed less fire toward his Demnocratic rival and more toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When the vice president referred to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a `` hustler from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'' _ a phrase that his aides said was meant to praise <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for working hard _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shot back that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` started to panic.'' `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has begun to call me names,'' he said. `` He's trapped in an unholy triangle between the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' he said, referring to Iranian Leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and the Iran-Contra affair, questions about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug activities and the legal difficulties surrounding Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Increasingly, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> portrayed himself as an insurgent candidate running against the combined forces of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Democratic leaders and the pundits. He appealed to party officials who will attend the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> as delegates to wait until the primary campaign ends before swinging behind a candidate. At one point he suggested his supporters might or might not work hard for the Democratic ticket this fall depending on how he was treated. But he later backed off, saying, `` We need not speak in terms of a fight.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent little time campaigning in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, alothough he toured several western states in a week in which he often seemed to be on the defensive.

 National Guardsmen patrolled for looters today in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> city blasted by powerful winds that killed one woman and injured at least 15 people in a wave of violent storms that pounded sections of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> and South. The storms spawned by a cold front Monday flipped airplanes in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, knocked out power to thousands in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and unleashed hail as big as baseballs in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's a disaster, just a disaster,'' said <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, estimating damage to his city in the millions. The storm destroyed a radio newsroom, tore roofs off buildings, blew furniture into the street and knocked out all power to the town. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> declared an emergency, and Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> activated 30 National Guardsmen to help clean up and keep the peace in the city of 11,000 residents near the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gap </LOCATION> just north of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> border. Sgt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Middlesboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that no arrests for looting had been made despite previous official reports to that effect. The thunderstorms that lashed the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on Monday weakened considerably by early today, with just scattered showers and thunderstorms remaining from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But strong thunderstorms continued over sections of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION>, the winds smashed a trailer, killing a woman and injuring her husband and child, police Sgt. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> England </PERSON> said. Many people were injured and there was an unconfirmed report that one person was missing, state police said. Fifteen people were treated at <ORGANIZATION> Middlesboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said assistant administrator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>. Helicopters carrying injured to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> 45 miles to the south had to turn back because of the bad weather, said a nursing supervisor who refused to give her name. The storm hit at 10:15 p.m. Monday, just as news director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> of radio station <ORGANIZATION> WFXY </ORGANIZATION> was getting ready to broadcast a warning about heavy thunderstorms. `` We were sitting there and the wind started to blow really hard and it -LRB- the station -RRB- exploded,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. `` It wiped my newsroom out. ... We have nothing. We're gone. My typewriter's gone I ca n't even find it.'' The wind blew roofs off downtown buildings, shattered windows, tore doors of hinges at the hospital and leveled a furniture store built in 1890, officials said. `` There's furniture all over the street,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. At the <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, 20 small planes were damaged, along with fuel pumps, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of the state Division of Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>. All power was knocked out, and crews were working today to restore it, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, safety coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>. Three emergency shelters were set up to give people left homeless a place to stay for the night, but fewer than a dozen showed up, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it could not confirm whether a tornado had hit <LOCATION> Middlesboro </LOCATION>. Tornadoes were reported in northeast and southwest sections of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with winds up to 70 mph recorded, but the weather service said it could not confirm the twisters. Six small planes, five of them tied down, were lifted into the air and damaged at <LOCATION> Burke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakefront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON> pegged the loss to the club at $ 125,000 In the southwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON> saw his picnic table lift off the ground in his back yard, spin like a helicopter, then come to rest 15 feet away. `` I did n't see a funnel, all I saw was the whirling,'' said <PERSON> Moloney </PERSON>. `` I do n't know how long it lasted, maybe a minute. Then there was some hard hail for a minute. Then it was gone.'' The storm downed trees and utility lines in many parts of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, about 1,400 people remained without power today, utility officials said. On Monday, 41,000 homes were without electricity. Trees and power lines also fell in <LOCATION> Pratt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, the weather service said. Hail fell in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Freestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, large hail damaged cars, the service said.

<HEAD>Unauthorized U.S. Stinger Missiles Show Up in Qatar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to find out how several of its Stinger anti-aircraft missiles wound up in the tiny <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the highly accurate, shoulder-fired rockets may have been passed to <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which in turn obtained them from the U.S.-supplied Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told a congressional hearing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seeking to get the missiles back and check their serial numbers against a list of Stingers supplied overseas. Speaking later to reporters, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the `` handful'' of Stingers had shown up about a month ago in a military parade in <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>. He said the Qataris had yet to agree to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to see the missiles. `` We want to know how they got them,'' he said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not control `` black market leakages'' of weapons around the world, despite a provision in its Stinger contracts with other governments which forbids transfer of the missiles to a third party. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> noted that the Stingers were considered an `` ideal terrorist's weapon'' because they are easy to carry, store and use. He also pointed to congressional sensitivity on the Stinger sales. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., asked <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can keep track of the Stingers despite its detailed inventories when the weapons are used by Afghan rebels against Soviet forces or Chadian troops fighting <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> conceded that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last year seized a shipment of Stingers sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Fragments of Stingers were found on an Iranian speedboat that attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last fall. Following that incident, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sought to prevent proliferation of the Stingers by banning future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of the rocket. But it made an exception for <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, a neighbor of <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>'s, to lease that country 70 Stingers for 18 months as a defensive weapon against possible attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Iceland Gets A Legal Brew, Must Wait 10 Months to Buy It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDRES MAGNUSSON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to legalize beer after 73 years of prohibition, but Icelanders will have to wait 10 more months before they can quaff a cold one. After a year-long debate, a full turnout of the upper house of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s Althing -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- voted 13-8 to stamp out the last vestiges of prohibition on the island and permit the sale of beer with an alcoholic content above 2.25 percent. A dozen beer-lovers flashed victory signs outside the Althing after the post-midnight vote, but there was little other public rejoicing. The beer wo n't go on sale until March 1, and while no price has been set, pro- and anti-prohibitionists both called for high prices, fearing the change could encourage alcohol abuse. Former lawmaker <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON>, who supported legalization, said: `` It's very important that people realize that beer is just as dangerous as other alcohol.'' Left-wing Althing member <PERSON> Svavar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gestsson </PERSON>, who opposed legalization, said: `` This is a very unfortunate step and a dreadful experience for me both as a parent and a parliamentarian.'' Beer, like other alcoholic drinks in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, is expected to come under strict controls _ available only in bars and restaurants or state liquor stores which have a monopoly on retailing and close early. The pro-beer lobby argued that legalization was inevitable, given the bureaucratic tangle that prohibition has caused. Beer has always provoked ambivalent feelings among the 243,000 Icelanders. On the one hand, beer is banned, but on the other hand, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s national drink is a skull-bashing distillation called `` Black Death.'' The islanders voted in a 1908 referendum for a ban on all alcoholic drinks, although it did n't take effect until Jan. 1 1915. The ban was partially lifted after <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> refused to buy <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s main export, fish, unless <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> bought Spanish wines, and in 1933, prohibition was repealed _ except for beer. A powerful temperance movement continued to block the suds, but the first crack appeared in 1980. Businessman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheving </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorsteinsson </PERSON> went to court demanding the same rights as airline crews who were bringing in internationally approved allowances of duty-free beer. Although <PERSON> Thorsteinsson </PERSON> lost, the publicity forced a change in the rules to allow Icelanders arriving from abroad to bring in 12.2 pints of foreign alcoholic beer. This spurred local companies to brew their own alcoholic beers for sale at <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>'s airport, one of the few in the world which has a duty-free store for incoming travelers. The anti-prohibition lobby returned to the warpath, arguing that it was unconstitutional that Icelanders who could afford foreign travel were entitled to buy beer. When the latest bill entered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, an opinion poll showed 64.3 percent in favor of legalization. When 16 doctors published newspaper ads warning of the health hazards, 133 others riposted with ads saying alcoholism could n't get worse if people switched from spirits to beer. The bill passed in the lower house on April 18 by a 23-17 vote with two members absent.

<NOTE>EDs: New thruout with Reagan comment on pardons; Fitzwater

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he has not ruled out pardons for Iran-Contra defendants <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied `` no'' when asked during a picture-taking session whether he had definitely ruled out the possibility of pardons for the two former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not elaborate on the one-word answer, but he said it with unusual emphasis. Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> reported Monday after having lunch with the president that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has effectively ruled out pardons before trial of any of the defendants in the Iran-Contra case, and said the president will probably be out of office by the time the case is decided. The president said he `` did n't believe in giving pardons before people are convicted of anything,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> related, adding that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reasoned `` it leaves the cloud of guilt on through the years.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> reported on the president's comments during an interview on <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday evening. The White House today released an excerpt of <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s interview. It said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, replying to a question about pardons, said: `` You ca n't consider that, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, until this case has been closed, whichever way it's going to go. To pardon somebody before trial leaves a sense of guilt around them, a cloud of guilt for the rest of time. And so this is something that I do n't have to face.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked to reconcile <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s report and the president's response today, said, `` I told you, it was n't definitive. ... It means there's been no decision. ... You got a ` yes' and a ` no', which means no definitive decision has been made.'' Earlier today, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he would not interpret <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments `` I have not talked to the president about it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I want to be fair to you. I think that there has not been a definitive decision made on pardons, I do n't believe. `` However, the language is here, it is plain and it did come from the president,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. `` So you can interpret that as good reporeters however you like but I simply can not go beyond it.'' At issue is whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will consider either pretrial or post-trial pardons of <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, former national security adviser; <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer; retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. According to a transcript of a court hearing released Monday, a compromise has been reached in the defense effort to review ultra-sensitive government documents related to the case. Under the agreement, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and their lawyers will review a small group of documents. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and their lawyers will not see the documents. They agreed in a hearing Friday to rely on the judgment of the lawyers for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is allowing the defense to review the material to verify prosecution claims that it is not relevant to the charges. The defense concession does not dispose of the larger problem of disclosing sensitive information that may be determined to be relevant when the case goes to trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued an order Monday giving independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> until May 30 to draw up a list of secret documents he wants to use as evidence that wo n't be declassified by the government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has received reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> might target Americans for attack because of alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the murder of a high-level <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told Tuesday. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had received such reports following last month's assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s second-in-command, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is believed to have carried out that assassination in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. The reports `` were serious enough to not take a chance'' by ignoring them, he told reporters following a congressional hearing. `` There was no specific target but the reports had plausibility because of the Abu Jihad'' murder, he said. Specifically, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned about the reports because of accusations by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> knew about and even approved <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. As a result, several American ambassadors in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries were asked to discuss the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns verbally with authorities there, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` There was no -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- letter,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. One Arab government conveyed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` and -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> decided to go public with this,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on arms control, international security and science. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s accusations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had made veiled threats to assassinate <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets. `` I assume you deny this?'' he was asked by Rep. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. `` Of course,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> responded At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the administration had made contact with a number of <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> countries as `` a prudent response to infomation available to us concerning possible attacks.'' He said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s interpretation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts was `` entirely without foundation.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> did not name the Arab intermediary, but in the past the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has conveyed messages to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> through <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> established its headquarters after being expelled by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> repeatedly has denied any involvement in the commando raid on <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> home. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said Monday he would stress this point in his talks later this week with Tunisian leaders in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top counterterrorism expert, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, said in an interview two weeks ago that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expects increased Palestinian terrorism in the wake of the Abu Jihad assassination and the five-month Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s new premier, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, is ambitious, pragmatic, non-doctrinaire and one of the nation's most popular politicians. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> was appointed Tuesday by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to lead the new government. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> will now get a chance to demonstrate whether the consistently high scores he gets in public opinion polls are matched by talent. His way wo n't be easy. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, a Socialist, will be trying to run a government dominated by his party yet develop policies attractive to centrists, whose support his administration needs. Meanwhile, he will have to get along with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who has been his rival for a decade. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has run for president three times. For this election, he had announced a year ago that he planned to run for the job, but stepped aside when it became clear last month that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was going to be a candidate. `` Whatever happens,'' <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told a newspaper recently. `` I know that one day I will go to the <LOCATION> Elysee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>,'' the seat of the French presidency. For the moment, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> will have to be content with the Hotel Matignon, the prime minister's office on the <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of the Seine. A dark-eyed chain smoker with impish features, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> is far better known at home than abroad. In the past year, however, he has met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s foreign policy would remain unchanged under the Socialists and that he would continue to assert the country's special independent stance within the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> alliance. He supports greater European and trans-Atlantic cooperation through quiet consultations to discuss defense questions such as the continuing presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> believes that Europeans should assume a greater share of the defense burden, but not under the threat of a withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. On economic issues, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has called himself a `` free enterprise leftist,'' who believes in the welfare state. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> needs to find a future,'' he said in a campaign speech, to become a `` more dynamic <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a more just <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a more convincing <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' He says the conservatives, who had been in power since 1986, have been hasty in selling off state-owned companies to private investors. A better policy, he has said, would be to allow these companies to raise capital so that they could grow and create jobs. One of the greatest challenges facing the new premier is <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 10.3 percent unemployment. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> says he believes in greater international cooperation in coordinating the economies of the industrialized nations. He also favors helping Third World nations ease their debt. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Courbevoie </LOCATION>, a suburb west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the son of a scientist who helped develop <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s atomic bomb. After living in colonial <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> turned to the political left. In the 1960s he was a student activist, using an alias because at the same time he was working his way through the country's elite professional schools, including the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a training ground for French politicians. After the left lost parliamentary elections in 1978, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> worked to sustain and modernize the Socialist party. At a party congress after the elections, he boosted morale with a stirring speech that said Socialism was still viable. He then worked to get the party to reject Marxist terminology and accept concepts such as the role of market forces in an advanced economy. Increasingly influential in the party, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> was mentioned as a possible choice for premier after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won his first term in 1981. Instead, he was appointed minister of state for planning and then minister of agriculture in 1983. Two years later, he resigned in a dramatic and well-publicized falling out with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> is a Protestant in a Roman Catholic nation, who enjoys sailing and skiing. He and his wife have two children in their 20s. He is also the mayor of the working class town of <LOCATION> Conflans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Honorine </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

 Another top presidential adviser has unleashed an account of his White House years, but scandal-hunters will have to look elsewhere. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> has little but praise for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s press secretary, says the slain president was a `` special man'' who surrounded himself with advisers who `` believed in each other'' and in a common mission. `` There was no barrier on the president's door,'' <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> writes in the June issue of <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s magazine. `` Any of his dozen principal staffers could see him when they wanted to. They did n't need permission from a chief of staff to gain access. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, `` was not a perfect man. ... For all his loftiness of purpose, he did not take himself that seriously. He had no great vision of himself as a political or intellectual giant.'' But <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, now with ABC News, says <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> learned from his mistakes. One measure of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s growth in office will be revealed this November, when private correspondence between <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Krushchev </PERSON> is scheduled to be released, <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> says. `` As one who has read most of them, I believe they will be a stunning revelation of two leaders of confrontational powers groping toward understanding,'' he writes.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of workers ended their eight-day strike without a settlement tonight, leaving the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard carrying a cross and the Polish flag and led by Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Police stood back silently and let the workers pass as they walked slowly and calmly out of the shipyard shortly after 8 p.m. Many workers carried luggage and boxes. The workers were applauded by bystanders as they exited, and some bystanders rushed forward and joined the workers' procession. Many of the workers had been in the shipyard since May 2, when the strike for higher pay and union rights began. Earlier today, the strikers accepted a strike committee proposal to end their work stoppage, a cameraman said, and a Solidarity banner was taken off the front gate of the shipyard. Strike spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> read a workers' statement saying, `` We are leaving the shipyard not in triumph, but with raised heads.'' Just before the workers ended their strike, <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON> called Gen. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrzejewski </PERSON> and demanded the removal of the police blockade around the shipyard, saying the workers were coming out, according to <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrzejewski </PERSON> was commanding the security forces at the shipyard, which has been surrounded by police since Thursday. Strike talks broke off Monday after strikers rejected a management offer. Attempts by a church mediator to persuade management to resume talks were proving unsuccessful, said <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. After the alleged detention and beating of two couriers in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, strikers complained earlier today that it was becoming more and more difficult to get food supplies from outside the shipyard. The shipyard work stoppage was the last strike in a string of five that began April 25, the country's worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law crackdown. `` I think we accomplished something. We gained general agreement on the other side that we exist,'' said <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Monday he and hundreds of workers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard were determined to hold out for their demands. `` We'll win We'll win!'' 700 strikers shouted during a rally at the shipyard. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, opposition activists and workers reported a strike starting Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Ursus </ORGANIZATION> tractor factory on the outskirts of the capital. But officials denied there was a strike and the report could not be verified. Strikers at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard rejected a management offer of pay raises and reinstatement of some fired activists because the deal did not include a legally recognized chapter of Solidarity. The independent union, the first in the Soviet bloc, was outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist government never ruled out using force to end the strike. A pre-dawn police raid last Thursday crushed a 10-day strike by steel workers at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> was a political unknown when Republican Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> appointed him after <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, 47, was one of several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars who lobbied for the job, and he acknowledged bitterness at being passed over despite having `` carried water for the elephant for 20 years.'' <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> mounted an aggressive campaign, referring to <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> as `` my appointed opponent'' and last week charging that he was a `` rubber stamp'' for Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who said he wanted to run `` a class campaign,'' refused to be drawn into name-calling, and Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said it was `` sad'' that <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> resorted to `` desperate'' tactics. An <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll taken the week before the primary showed 41 percent preferred <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, 40 percent backed <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> and the remainder were undecided.

 The tale of the starstruck Reagans rolled across the front pages of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this week, drawing jokes and jibes along the way, and even surfaced on the floor of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` I come under <PERSON> Libra </PERSON>, which is a very balanced sign,'' declared Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> when asked by a lighthearted fellow Conservative lawmaker whether she planned to move an astrologer into her No. 10 Downing St. residence. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 62, was born Oct. 13, under <PERSON> Libra </PERSON>, the sign of the scales. The allegations by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> about the role the zodiac played in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House are giving <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s cartoonists, punsters and humorists a lot of fun. `` Advice on Star Wars from the Stars Themselves,'' headlined <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Rundschau newspaper. `` The star-spangled planner,'' sniped <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Independent. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most prestigious paper, ran a cartoon asking an astrologer: `` How come you did n't predict <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book?'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book was preceeded by several other books and articles by former close associates of the president, most notably a recent book by ex-presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>. In his book, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said he made up quotes for the president without checking them with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The issue of kiss-and-tell _ or `` spit-and-tell'' as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Guardian put it _ does n't interest many Europeans Many governments bind employees to lifetime oaths of confidence that make such revelations difficult. One family that has suffered the scourge is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royals. The family also imposes oaths of confidence, and in 1983 it resorted to the unprecedented tactic of suing a former Buckingham Palace kitchen worker and the tabloid Sun, which was serializing his memoirs. The Sun settled out of court and scrapped the series. `` I understand what <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was doing ... my wife does the same thing, but taking an opinion from an astrologer is one thing and basing decision-making on him or her is quite another,'' said a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> parliamentarian, who declined to be named. Greek fortuneteller <PERSON> Fortoula </PERSON>, a 50-year veteran medium, claims to have been consulted in her basement apartment near the Parliament in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> by `` several prime ministers and I do n't know how many cabinet ministers'' from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during her career. `` Why not? Politicians in government need the advice of all sorts of people,'' she said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> as saying he reads the horoscopes daily but does n't believe in them. `` It is interesting to learn what I supposedly face day by day,'' he said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` Astrology is very interesting, but personally I would rather place my fate in the hands of our loving God.'' Dutch astrologer <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandu </PERSON> said he frequently advises politicians on party matters, but declined to name names. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had given his trade a boost. But <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schouten </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Utrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s parapsychology department said he doubted astrology played a role in Dutch politics. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s conservative newspaper, <PERSON> Neue </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuercher </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>, predicted the astrology story would haunt the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> the way <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> suffered from his story about confronting a giant killer rabbit. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s left-of-center <PERSON> Guardian </PERSON> said it was glad `` there is one date that not even Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s astrologers can postpone. The date of the next presidential election.''

<HEAD>US Official Voices Confidence That Treaty Differences Can Be
Cleared Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official voiced confidence Tuesday that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would be able to clear up differences over a missile-ban treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in a new round of talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The differences over policing the accord against cheating prompted <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Monday to indefinitely postpone ratification. `` These are very, very technical issues, and we've had the problem of pursuing them at long distance through diplomatic exchange, informal translations, things of that sort,'' the official told reporters before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> boarded an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet for two days of talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` There may, in fact, be differences, but I am quite confident that if you get all of the right people in the city, at the expert level, with the ministers watching over the process, that we'll be able to nail these things down,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said on his arrival in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Tuesday that he was `` not quite clear what the problems'' were. He said the Soviets had answered questions raised by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about monitoring the agreement to scrap all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles. `` Basically the verification problems regarding the INF treaty have been resolved, I think,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. The Soviet answers were delivered to the State Department Sunday night by Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> and presented Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where they received a chilly reception. Subsequently, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders decided to postpone debate over ratification, which had been scheduled to begin Wednesday. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the Democratic leader, said the treaty would remain `` on the back burner'' until the differences were resolved. `` We do n't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' he said. `` This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> takes up the treaty.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> appealed to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to take steps to end the dispute holding up the treaty. `` The Soviets hold the key,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. There are nine technical issues in dispute. The two most significant involve Soviet attempts to restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection of missile containers and the range of access for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitoring personnel within designated areas. Even if <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> resolve the differences in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where they reached final agreement on the treaty last November, it was not clear whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be able _ or willing _ to ratify the accord before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> starting May 29. Another dispute erupted, meanwhile, as the Soviets asserted a right to inspect West German Pershing 1-A missiles that are stored in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The rockets have a range of 465 miles, within the span of the treaty, and the nuclear warheads are owned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> called the Soviet demand `` sopmething we find astonishing, that they should choose to raise that issue.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decision to postpone debate on the treaty `` is a prudent and reasonable course of action.'' `` There is unanimity between the administration and the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership that these problems should be satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification,'' he said. `` The administration has made clear to the Soviets the need for an expeditious solution.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we hope to resolve these issues quickly. We're still of the view that it is possible to have the treaty ratified prior to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had hoped in his fourth and probably final meeting with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to sign a far more significant treaty to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that hope for such a pact had about run out. The official said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would issue a joint statement `` identifying in some way where we are'' on arms control and other issues. The idea would be for the president who succeeds <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January to pick up from there. After an all-night flight, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> planned to hold two meetings with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Wednesday and two more on Thursday before flying to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Friday to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arms control experts will meet separately in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, under the supervision of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Of the non-nuclear issues on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s agenda, the two likely to get the most attention were human rights and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Human rights issues to be discussed may include an effort to form an opposition party in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has encountered resistance from Soviet authorities. `` We regret that when Soviet citizens try to involve themselves directly in democracy that they are harassed and arrrested,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. On southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been attempting for years to negotiate the withdrawal of more than 40,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as well as independence and black majority rule for South African-controlled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. One hopeful sign was an unprecedented meeting last week in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> involving officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the meeting left the impression among some that there is a new political will among parties to the conflicts to reach a settlement.

 Scientists have identified a brain chemical that causes panic attacks when injected into panic attack patients, suggesting the substance may play a role in the disorder that afflicts 1.2 million Americans. All 11 panic attack patients given cholecystokinin intravenously suffered attacks, beginning an average of 20 seconds after the injection, said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradwejn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The patients said the symptoms occurred in the same order as in spontaneous attacks, he said. Bradwejn reported the study Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. Panic attacks strike victims with overwhelming terror for no apparent reason. Attacks can include such symptoms as sweating, heart palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath, choking sensations, faintness and fear of losing control or of dying. The first attack usually occurs by the victim's late 20s, and episodes can recur several times a week, even daily. The disorder can last for years, with varying periods of remission or exacerbation. If not treated, panic sufferers can become suicidal. Researchers can trigger panic attacks in patients by exposing them to carbon dioxide or other substances not found in the brain. <PERSON> Cholecystokinin </PERSON>'s normal role appears to be helping brain and nerve cells communicate, <PERSON> Bradwejn </PERSON> said. Its possible role in panic attacks was suggested by experiments showing that its effect on nerve cells was blocked by anti-panic medication, he said. In the new study, each patient received injections on each of two days. One day they received cholecystokinin, the other day an inert salt solution. No patient had an attack after the salt solution. Attacks induced by the brain substance lasted about 21 minutes, give or take about eight minutes, <PERSON> Bradwejn </PERSON> said. Besides normal symptoms, some patients reported blurred vision, a warmth in the throat or chest, a bitter taste or a prickling in the throat, he said. If cholecystokinin plays a role in spontaneous attacks, he said, it is not clear whether the attacks are produced by a surge of its natural levels or an abnormally high sensitivity to it. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Raichle </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, who has studied brain abnormalities in panic disorder, said the next step will be to see how the locations of cholecystokinin in the brain correspond to the nerve circuitry that connects to areas implicated in the disorder.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager was sentenced Tuesday to 52 years and eight months in prison for the slayings of three people, after authorities reported the youth felt remorse because he had lost his friends over the deaths. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said it was obvious that the defendant, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON>, 18, had not `` assumed responsibility for the death of the three people.'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> read from a <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> report that said that <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON> had said he was sorry but had not displayed evidence of his `` ability to empathize.'' The report quoted <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON> as saying that `` the worst thing that happened was that I lost 95 percent of my friends over this.'' The judge said he gave <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON> the maximum sentence possible under a plea bargain. <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty last January, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 17, were charged with shooting to death <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON> testified that the three were killed to obtain their cars for a bank robbery that never took place. King is awaiting trial. Public Defender <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Haffner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bivert </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 26 years and four months, but he said it may be 30 or 40 years before his client is released.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday vetoed a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution that condemned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s recent raid into south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and called for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and all occupied territories. The vote was 14-1, despite efforts to moderate the resolution to avoid a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veto. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> frequently exercises its veto to kill resolutions critical of the Jewish state. The vote came after a three-day debate requested by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which protested the two-day incursion. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, explaining the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veto, said the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> should not discuss southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in resolutions `` that fail to recognize the attacks and reprisals originating on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border.'' He said that armed Palestinians, supported by pro-Iranian groups, repeatedly have tried to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the last four months to carry out violent acts. `` We can not accept a resolution that does not acknowledge the well-known fact that hostile acts against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are originating in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports the independence, territorial integrity and unity of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has called for withdrawal of all foreign forces and the extension of central government authority throughout that country, he said. But, he said, `` the sad truth remains that as long as armed, extremist elements use southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to stage terrorist attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the border can not be secure.'' British Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, the deputy permanent representative, said the resolution failed to consider attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and hostilities on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border. But he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s latest incursion has done damage to its cause and said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would vote for the resolution `` in view of the excesses of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the two-day operation last week was necessary to root out terrorists who stage attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and more than 40 Arab guerrillas died in two days of fighting in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week. The meeting Tuesday was the sixth <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting in six months called to deplore <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, its deportation of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, its military actions in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the assassination of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> that has been blamed on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Fireworks were used indoors illegally at a Motley Crue concert, according to a lawyer for a teen-ager who lost an eye while attending a performance by the heavy metal rock band. A civil lawsuit that went to trial this week seeks $ 2.2 million for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, who lost an eye, and $ 400,000 for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, who had his lip split. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, the teen-agers' attorney, said in his opening statement Monday that flying debris hit his clients during the Sept. 25, 1985 concert in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>. But an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Motley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> told jurors there were no explosives onstage that could propel objects through the air. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the two teen-agers `` got hurt out there ... and we ca n't explain it, but it did not come from special effects.'' <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sixx </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Motley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crue </LOCATION>, sat quietly in <ORGANIZATION> Limestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> during jury selection. <PERSON> Sixx </PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION> Motley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Democratic leaders Tuesday prepared to send the omnibus trade bill to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this week for an expected veto after efforts to erase its <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil provisions proved futile. `` I had hoped that if these offending provisions had been eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing this bill,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said after a move to drop the oil provisions was Labor leaders, clergymen and other supporters of the 1,000-page bill were invited to a Wednesday ceremony at which <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, planned to sign the bill. It won final passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on April 27 but instead of being sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk has been becalmed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> while leaders have sought to do a bit of after-the-fact tailoring. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> on Tuesday sought unanimous consent to take up a technical resolution that would have erased the bill's restrictions on exports of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil. The technical resolution, approved last week by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would have instructed an official known as the enrolling clerk to dot i's and cross some t's in the bill _ and erase the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil provisions at the same time Unlike <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders, however, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> needed to obtain unanimous consent before bringing the resolution to the floor. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said there were a number of objections among Republicans to bringing up the resolution Doing so without a time limit, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> added, would merely launch a long string of amendments involving complex issues ranging from plant-closings to <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> ethanol imports. `` We would have a full-scale trade debate here for several days,'' he said, That appeared to end the effort to strike the oil exports curbs, one of two features <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said would justify his planned veto. The other is a provision that would require companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60-day notice of plant-closings and large-scale layoffs. One of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions would limit exports from new <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> refineries to 70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of total output. The other would clear the way for export to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> of 50,000 barrels of crude daily. But it would require that the oil be transported first in an American vessel to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> port in the lower 48 states, such as <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and then reshipped. The features are favorites of maritime unions and similar versions appear in the currently pending U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement. Critics have said that they violate a constitutional ban on discrimination against one state's port to the advantage of another state's port.

 Reputed Colombian drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> saw cocaine as a revolutionary weapon against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a prosecutor said Tuesday in final arguments in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s cocaine-smuggling trial. `` He's still at war,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> told the jury. `` He has n't stopped.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> considered cocaine a weapon, and `` you see where his missiles landed,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said, pointing to a map showing where <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> allegedly had cocaine flown into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, holding a tiny cocaine spoon, said the government had proved that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> imported 18,000 kilograms, or about 39,600 pounds, of the powder into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He asked the jury to consider how much time it would take to dip out that amount, a spoonful at a time. He then provided an answer: `` More time that you have remaining on this earth.'' A cart holding 277 pounds of cocaine stood beside him as he spoke. Authorities say <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, is a leader of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION>, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, prosecutors have said. He is charged with bringing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980, paying bribes and making threats to use <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> as a private relay station `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had a lot in common,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was the pioneer of the mass transporation of cocaine for the American consumer.'' The prosecutor also referred to old TV interviews of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> played during the trial, telling jurors to take the defendant at his word. `` He told you cocaine has become a revolutionary weapon to destroy the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- empire,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. `` The end justifies the means.'' Defense attorneys, who rested without calling witnesses, were expected to close Wednesday. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> blasted defense arguments that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> had been used by convicted smuggler and key prosecution witness <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> is not the king of cocaine,'' the prosecutor said, adding that to equate <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s organization to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s group of American smugglers was like `` comparing the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> to the Little League.'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> also pointed to acts of violence laid to <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, and referred to a September 1978 meeting, in which <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> reportedly said, `` Every once in a while in this business someone has to die.'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> also mentioned threats to those who ventured to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, including former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> A total of 115 government witnesses, many of them convicted smugglers, depicted <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as a flamboyant, womanizing, neo-Nazi who used money and force to build a cocaine-smuggling kingdom on the Bahamian island. The jury, which heard 22 weeks of testimony, likely will get the case Friday and begin its deliberations on the 11-count indictment that charges <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. If convicted, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> faces up to life plus 165 years in prison and the forfeiture of his assets in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy. He faces up to 15 years in prison.

<HEAD>Top Official To Help End Turf War Over Pursuit Of Fugitives</HEAD>

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is designating a top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official to help end a turf war between the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> over the pursuit of fugitives, a department spokesman said Tuesday. Under the arrangement, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is trying to settle the longstanding feud by having acting Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> arbitrate individual disagreements over whether the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will handle a particular fugitive investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been increasingly successful under a 1979 agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in tracking down fugitives, but the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has said the marshals have expanded their role too far. Sources at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said little appears to have changed under <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision and that the main alteration has been to set up a dispute mechanism in the associate attorney general's office <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> last week the bureau generally retains jurisdiction of tracking down escapees who fled after being arrested but before going to trial, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> that his agency retains jurisdiction over the apprehension of fugitives who escaped after being convicted, <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. Under <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> generally would have jurisdiction over all fugitives _ whether in the pre - or post-conviction phase _ involved in foreign counterintelligence cases, organized crime or terrorism But if the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has made major progress on a fugitive case, it might ask to assist or take over an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> fugitive investigation, said <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> may ask the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to turn over jurisdiction over an investigation involving a fugitive who has been convicted but who has committed new crimes after fleeing. The sources said the attorney general's decision leaves the door open, contingent on the approval of the associate attorney general's office, for the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to continue aggressive pursuit in the types of investigations that led to the apprehension of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is an ex-CIA official who was sought for training Libyan terrorists and supplying them with explosives. The marshals lured <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and put him on a flight to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he was arrested.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to outgoing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> on Tuesday, saying his `` gift of statesmanship'' helped unify the alliance. `` Your efforts on behalf of us all during the past four years has set a new standard,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, who will be succeeded at the end of his term in June by West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. `` Your stewardship of the alliance has continued a life's work in support of human decency and the ideal of freedom, the very basis of the compact for peace that we call <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said in presenting him the medal, the nation's highest civilian award. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> had done a good job of bringing together the views of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Reconciling the occasionally differing views of the European members of the alliance with those of the North Americans is a special challenge,'' he said. `` But one of your special gifts has always been an ability to find common ground, and nowhere is that more important than at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. You believed in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> when it counted and that spirit has been contagious.'' `` It has been your gift of statesmanship which has brought our transatlantic partnership to a level of unity and common purpose unparalleled in the history of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Some 75 Presidential Medals of Freedom have been awarded by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but few of them for non-U.S. citizens. Among the foreigners to have been honored were <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, the former president of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, who was given the award posthumously; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Luns </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>'s predecessor at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>; and cellist <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> paid tribute to the president for supporting the alliance and keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense strong.

 <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>'s long-time star soprano who took over the company and helped rescue it from financial disaster, announced Tuesday that she will retire at the end of the year `` I think 10 years is long enough,'' Miss <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> said of her second career as general director of the nation's second-largest opera company in terms of budget and number of performances. She said she thought it was important that a new five-year plan be created to guide the company, and, noting she will be 60 next spring, said `` I do n't think this young, vital company should be run by a 65-year-old woman.'' Miss <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> said a search for her successor would begin soon and that upon her retirement she would become president of the company's board and would continue to help raise funds. She met with reporters at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> performs in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, next door to the Metropolitan Opera House. The theater was the scene of many of her triumphs during a 20-year singing career that included such widely varying roles as the doomed maiden of <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>'s `` Lucia di Lammermoor'' and the romantic heroine of <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON>'s `` Manon.'' But it was her managerial triumphs that took center stage Tuesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chairman of the board, said that when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> became head of the company, taking over from <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudel </PERSON>, `` We hardly had enough money to meet the payroll; it was a close call. `` Now we have a surplus of $ 3 million,'' he said. `` For the last five years we've been operating profitably.'' The company's budget for fiscal 1989, which begins July 1, is projected at $ 26 million. In 1978, when she took over, the budget was nearly $ 9 million. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also said performing standards had risen under Miss <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>' regime, and that she had `` achieved artistic revival with demonic determination to control costs.'' He praised Miss <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>' introduction of English surtitles above the stage, her combining spring and fall seasons into one season and her finding financing for five years of a spring musical comedy season. During her tenure as general director, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> has emphasized the engagement of young American singers and American conductors, designers and directors. She has stressed acting as well as singing. Miss <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> said she was considering various plans for the future, but insisted she would `` never go to work for another opera company.'' `` The profit-making world seems awfully attractive to me,'' she said. `` You are n't out with a tin cup. I have been offered a talk show. I might do that.'' She also said she planned to `` take a little vacation with my husband when the dust settles and see if he can remember what my first name is.'' Though she sang in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1975, most of her singing career was at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. She starred in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s `` The Ballad of Baby Doe'' in 1958 and shot to acclaim in 1966 when she sang <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON> opposite bass-baritone <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Treigle </PERSON> in <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>. The warmth of her stage personality made the title role of `` Manon'' her best role. Audiences also loved her in `` <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> di Lammermoor'' and `` The Daughter of the Regiment.'' She took on a harder challenge and triumphed when she sang <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>'s three <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> queens, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuarda </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolena </PERSON>.''

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Tuesday that he does n't understand why the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not ratified an arms control treaty that bans medium - and shorter-range nuclear weapons <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said, however, that a dispute has arisen over verification issues. `` Basically the verification problems regarding the INF treaty have been resolved, I think,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said after arriving at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s Cointrin airport. The Soviet foreign minister begins a two-day meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> here on Wednesday. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statement contrasted with remarks by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who said a serious dispute had broken out over verification The verification dispute centers primarily on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that the Soviets are trying to restrict access by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitors to Soviet missile plants and sites. The Intermediate Nuclear Forces accord, which bans nuclear missiles with a range of about 300 to 3,000 miles, was signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet Communist party leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I'm not quite clear what the problems, what the difficulties in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are. We have not been told yet,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said after arriving at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s Cointrin airport. Another Senator, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said Soviet officials `` have turned us down flatly'' on some verification issues previously thought to have been settled He said there were about 10 outstanding and unresolved verification issues. Senators had expressed hope that the problems could be resolved during the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has postponed debate on the treaty until the dispute is resolved. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month asked the Soviets for an explanation, and the Soviets replied Sunday night. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side `` was asking certain questions, certain points of clarification'' on the verification issue. `` We answered those questions and we thought that there is no problem,'' he said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` We do n't consider the Soviet response to our questions fully satisfactory. There's more work to be done.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said that on other questions, not dealing with INF verification, `` we have brought new ideas.'' He did not elaborate. Other items on the foreign ministers' agenda are conventional weapons, nuclear testing, regional problems and bilateral and humanitarian issues, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> downplayed prospects for quick agreement on another arms control agreement, called START, that would cut strategic, or intercontinental nuclear forces by up to 50 percent. He said he did not think the two sides would be able to complete work on that agreement by the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit May 29-June 2. `` But we will try to achieve substantial progress,'' he added. At their summit meeting last December, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had instructed their negotiators to try to prepare a START treaty in time for signing at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said it was difficult to predict when a START agreement might be completed. `` But a lot of work has been done and I think that we will be able to make some progress here in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and particularly during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet media on Tuesday reported that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has indefinitely postponed ratification of the arms accord. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats of playing an election-year `` political game.'' Although the Soviet government is also going through a detailed ratification process, final approval is a formality because the treaty signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has already been endorsed by the ruling 13-man Politburo.

 Sporadic sniper fire crackled in the Shiite Moslem slums Tuesday and rival militiamen fortified their positions, apparently convinced that a truce arranged by the Syrian army would not last. Families streamed out of the ramshackle 16 square miles of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, carrying mattresses, bundles of clothing and other possessions. About 250,000 Shiites lived in the slums before the battle began last Friday, but police said 60 percent had fled by Tuesday. The 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans, are also thought to be held captive in the slums. Police reported five people wounded by sniper fire. Gone at least temporarily were the tank, mortar and rocket duels between the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militias Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> that killed at least 154 people and wounded 372 in the previous four days. Before dawn, 36 Syrian officers moved into the area with six committees to man truce observation posts. Police said each committee included an Iranian Embassy official, a representative of Amal and another of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, a mainstream militia backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and the radical, pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are fighting for control of the slums. Amal is Arabic for Hope and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> means Party of God. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, allies in public, are competing behind the scenes for influence with the 1.2 million Shiites, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest sect President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps 25,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including 7,500 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. After 13 years of civil war, he was the country's undisputed power broker until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began challenging the Syrian position. There still was no word Tuesday on the fate of the hostages, most of whom are believed held by kidnappers linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. A police source said it was `` physically impossible'' for hostages to have been smuggled out because <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian army control the slum exits. The Syrians sent 7,500 soldiers to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 to stop a factional war in which the two main elements were Amal and the Druse militia led by <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. They drove <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen from some outposts in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> but have stayed out of the southern Shiite slums. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said Tuesday, however: `` It is impermissible to let the current state of affairs continue.'' When asked whether soldiers would be sent into the slums if the fighting did not stop, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> said: `` We hope it wo n't come to that, but we shall not allow the bloodshed to continue.'' A Lebanese police spokesman, whose name can not be revealed because of regulations, said the truce committees were `` trying to convince the warring factions to observe a cease-fire as a first step.'' The three-point truce plan announced Monday calls for a cease-fire, pulling militiamen off the streets and a return to positions held before the battle began. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which has gained control of about half the slum area since Friday, `` rejects the return to pre-Friday positions,'' the police spokesman said Tuesday. Militiamen of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> were seen fortifying their positions with earthworks in the densely populated districts <PERSON> Ghobeiri </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> el-Abed and <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> controls the Haret Hreik, Mreiji, <PERSON> Roweiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kasskass </LOCATION> districts, plus the main gateways into the slums. According to the police spokesman, <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> moved in 1,000 more fighters from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a main base for the Syrian army. The ancient city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> is a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stronghold. `` It appears that both sides are preparing for another round of fighting,'' the police spokesman said. How many combatants have been involved on both sides is unclear. A police source said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> could put about 5,000 men in the field, but Amal is believed to be larger and has a broader following among the Shiites. <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarhan </PERSON>, a vegetable vendor, and his wife and four children walked out of the slums Tuesday carrying mattresses and clothes. `` We have been living in a basement since Friday,'' he said. `` I think this is the beginning of a long battle. We will come back when this is over.'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, a 30-year-old grocer, was trying to patch a bullet hole in his car's gas tank. `` We need the car to get out of here,'' he said. His wife and three daughters were packing the car with mattresses, clothing, a television set and a sewing machine. Some of those who flee have family or friends elsewhere in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Others camp out on the streets of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> or take refuge in schools, mosques or sports stadiums.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Seize ID Cards in Gaza Sweep</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops roused Palestinians at dawn Tuesday and confiscated their identity papers in a new campaign to force 400,000 Arabs in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to renew their government ID cards. Arab underground leaders warned residents via leaflets and mosque loudspeakers that the ID campaign in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was a plot to break a five-month Palestinian uprising. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, said the effort was designed to ferret out false ID cards and catch security and tax offenders. Refusal to pay taxes and other fees has been a chief tactic of the struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Some of the new cards actually banned Palestinians from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Also Tuesday, Israeli troops shot and wounded an Arab youth in the stomach after an army jeep was stoned in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Ramin </LOCATION>, eight miles north of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the military command said. The unidentified youth was in serious condition, officials at nearby <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> hospital said. The army said a soldier was slightly wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said 185 Arabs and two Israelis have been killed since the violence in the occupied territories started Dec. 8. The army said this week that more than 1,400 Palestinians have been injured, along with 298 soldiers and 172 Israeli settlers. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Tuesday, underground leaflets told <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents to resist the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> campaign to renew identity cards. `` Do not change your ID cards,'' the leaflets read. `` This will harm the uprising's achievements and strength.'' Troops banged on doors at dawn to awake Palestinians and demand their papers. `` They banged on windows and doors and ordered us to hand over our identity cards. They said we had to change them,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalo </PERSON>, a Moslem religious leader from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The army said about 2,000 of the 8,000 residents of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rimal </LOCATION> area applied for new ID cards Hundreds of Palestinians crowded into large, dust-covered tents at two schools converted into makeshift registration centers. Many said the army forced them to come. The orders affect Palestinians between the ages 16 and 60, who have to pay $ 10 for new cards. The army said it would take about three months to issue new IDs to everyone. Arabs in the occupied lands must carry an identity card at all times and show the card at frequent security checks. Identity cards are vital for all transactions with the military government. Many of the hundreds of Arabs standing in the sweltering heat for about four hours Tuesday waiting for their pictures to be taken were angry because there was only one photographer. `` It is <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> -LRB- a Moslem holy month -RRB-. We are fasting,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, 26. `` We are not animals to spend all day here waiting. Instead of changing our identity cards the Israelis should change their minds about occupying our land.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said some new identity cards carried a message saying the bearer was barred from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A military source confirmed there were `` special instructions'' on some cards but refused to elaborate. An 18-year-old Palestinian who identified himself only as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> said he would not change his card. `` On the new IDs, they will write all the previous times I was in prison,'' he said. `` If it's written on the ID that I was in prison I will get special treatment.

The army also said Tuesday it had cracked a guerrilla ring in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that was planning to carry out a suicide bombing in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s central bus station. The group, identified as belonging to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, was also linked to four other attacks, including laying a mine that injured four Israeli troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> last March and planting a bomb at an Israeli school south of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in February, an army spokesman said. No one was hurt by the bomb. A military representative speaking on condition of anonymity said the ring was broken last week. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said Tuesday that Israeli settlers were aggravating tension in the occupied territories. He cited a clash with Arabs at <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> last month in which an Israeli teen-ager died. In another development, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, appealed to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to release Arab-American activist <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> from jail and cancel a deportation order against him. The government has blamed <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who advocates civil disobedience against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation, for inciting violence. He was moved Tuesday to <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> prison from the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> jail where he had been held since Thursday, a police spokesman said. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who had been on a hunger strike since his arrest, accepted food for the first time Tuesday, eating an orange, said his American-born wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>. It was not immediately clear whether he would resume his fast, she said.

<BYLINE>Thousand AIDS Suicides Expected By 1991, Researchers Say

 About 1,000 people with AIDS will kill themselves by 1991 if current trends continue, researchers said Tuesday. They based that figure on an estimate of 380 suicides per 100,000 diagnosed AIDS cases in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> study. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzuk </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the relatively high rate indicates that mental health professionals should help patients better deal with the stresses of the deadly disease. He added they should aggressively treat psychiatric symptoms that may contribute to suicide risk. He and his colleagues described the work at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. Researchers reviewed medical examiner records for all <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suicides in 1985 through 1987. They found 42 suicides by people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome during that period, of about 11,000 city residents with the disease. Ages ranged from 22 to 58, with an average of 38. All were men. Fifty-seven percent were homosexuals or bisexuals and 12 percent intravenous drug users. The rest had other risk factors for the disease or the factors were unknown, <PERSON> Marzuk </PERSON> said. Two-thirds of the group killed themselves within six months of being told they had AIDS, he said. Another period of high risk was in the later stages of the disease, when euthanasia might play a role, he said. The effect of the AIDS virus on the central nervous system and psychological pressures of the disease appear to contribute to the suicide rate, he said. The virus may generate depression, dementia, psychosis or other conditions that could contribute to suicide risk, he said. And the diagnosis often forces the person to reveal homosexuality or illicit drug use to family and friends, who may then abandon the person, he said. <PERSON> Marzuk </PERSON> also said homosexuals and intravenous drug users are thought to have higher-than-normal suicide rates, even without AIDS. The research updates results based on suicides in 1985. The updated statistics appear to bear out the early data that men, ages 20 to 59, with AIDS run 36 times the risk of suicide as comparable men without the disease, <PERSON> Marzuk </PERSON> said. The early data also suggested an overall suicide risk of 66 times the rates of other people of the same ages and gender. Those estimates are `` very close to what we suspect,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s task force on psychology and AIDS. It will be important to compare the rates to those of homosexual men without the diagnosis to find the impact of the disease itself, he said. In other research described Tuesday, researchers said they found evidence that simply educating inner-city youth about the risks of getting the virus through sexual contact fails to cut their risk. A study of 102 residents of the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, area found no relationship between their degree of knowledge about sexual transmission of the virus and their amount of high-risk sexual behavior, researchers said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Tuesday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of threatening to kill <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials if Palestinian guerrillas attack American targets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied the accusation. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that it had received reports the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> might target Americans because of alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s second in command. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Israeli officials who spoke on condition they not be identified said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> squad carried out the assassination. There have been accusations by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> knew about and approved plans for slaying <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader, claimed the threat to kill <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials was made in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government document the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> obtained from an Arab government. He refused to identify the government. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s accusation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> threatened <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been in touch with a number of <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> countries about possible <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attacks against American citizens and facilities. He added that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s interpretation of those contacts was `` entirely without foundation.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villa in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, where extra security guards have been deployed. He said security also was being augmented at <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> offices around the Arab world following the alleged threat. He produced a photocopy of the alleged document. It appeared to be part of a longer document with the word `` CONFIDENTIAL'' stamped at the bottom. The document, which was typewritten in English, referred to <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> by his code name, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>. It read: `` You may be aware of charges in several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> and particulary Palestinian circles that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> knew of and approved <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>'s assassination. `` On April 18th -LRB- a -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ` condemns this act of political assassination,' ` had no knowledge of' and ` was not involved in any way in this assassination. `` It has come to our attention that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against American citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliation for last month's assassination of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>. `` Any possible targeting of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel and facilities in retaliation for <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>'s assassination would be totally reprehensible and unjustified. We would hold the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> responsible for any such attacks.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the document `` reveals the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is planning, in full cooperation with the Israelis, to conduct a crusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for them. `` These attacks will then be used to justify the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders.'' He strongly denied that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> planned any such attacks.

<TEXT>
 The military should n't become deeply involved in fighting illegal drugs because soldiers are n't properly trained to enforce civilian laws, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` I do not believe law enforcement, making arrests, is appropriate'' for the military, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` I think it is unwise to get the military into the law enforcement question.'' `` Do we shoot people? Do we shoot down planes?'' he said at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was trying to deal with a rising wave of sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the military should be used more heavily to block the flow of illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 385-23 to order President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to have the military seal the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against drug traffickers. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said earlier this week that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders are drafting an anti-drug bill that will increase the military role. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, D-Ala., asked the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to develop within 10 days a plan for using military resources to stop the cross-border drug flow <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> armed services investigations subcommittee, made his request after a hearing at which a bipartisan group of lawmakers also chastised <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for their reluctance to increase military involvement in the war on drugs. `` We recognize that this is a mission that you would enter into with some degree of concern,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. `` It's not the normal duties that have been assigned to the military. ... But I have to ask myself, if not the military, then who? We're not getting the job done.'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said he wants the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s drug interdiction plan ready for subcommittee hearings later this month in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to debate and vote on similar proposals this week as the chamber works on its version of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendments is being written by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committee Military enforcement of civilian laws is banned by an 1878 law, the Posse Comitatus Act, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amended the law six years ago to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to share some information with civilian law enforcement agencies. Since then, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted, military planes and ships routinely have given information to law enforcement officials, including the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel ride aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to make drug arrests. `` Thousands and thousands of planes fly across our borders annually with drugs,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` Either we're going to have a war on drugs and get the military involved or we're not.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said, `` We're at war here and we think the people to be handling a war are in the Department of Defense.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> answered that `` I agree that there is a war on, but I believe it is a different kind of war than the military is involved in.'' `` We can do a certain amount of this and we are doing the maximum,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said of current anti-drug efforts. `` The military are not trained for the law enforcement mission,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` To suddenly tell them you're in law enforcement, you have to shift the entire focus, the training. ... There's a major difference between military and police work. Our people are not trained to read Miranda rights, they are trained to shoot to kill.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for force management and personnel, said, `` We need to look at what we as a country can realistically accomplish in -LRB- drug -RRB- interdiction. We ca n't just say, ` Seal the borders in 30 days.''' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said using the military to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders to drug traffickers would cost a minimum of $ 20 billion and harm <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> readiness.

 Wind storms and fire snarled air traffic at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> earlier this week and when a gunman threatened to shoot at airplanes Tuesday, authorities reached an inescapable conclusion. `` It was a pretty bad week,'' said <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Storms and a fire severing phone links between the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> control center and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s two airports disrupted air service around the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Sunday and into Monday. Just as things were on their way back to normal Tuesday, the gunman struck. From an apartment in a suburb near <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, one of the world's busiest airports, the gunman forced authorities to divert about 125 departing flights from a runway that would have sent them over the building, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said The diversions resulted in delays of up to 20 minutes a flight, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> added. The gunman, who surrendered after allegedly shooting a policeman in the foot, was being held in <LOCATION> DuPage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. By midday Tuesday, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said things were returning to normal. But `` the weather is very bad in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' and authorities were watching whether that would affect flights at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, he said. A week of troubles began on what had been a balmy Mother's Day as storms swirled into the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area on wind gusting up to 80 mph. A tornado touched down about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. While the storm raged, firefighters battled a fire that swept through an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone switching station in suburban <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>. That cut off telephone service for thousands of customers and severed the phone link between the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s control center in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> and air traffic control computers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s other major airport, Midway Without the computer links, controllers had to use back-up phone lines to get air traffic information manually, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. Nearly half the lines from <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> were restored or rerouted Tuesday, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said, adding authorities expected all the circuits to be working by Wednesday. The combination of weather and disrupted phone service caused delays and flight cancellations. `` We had delays as long as two hours at its height, Sunday night and early Monday morning,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, spokesman for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The airline canceled about 40 of 800 flights in and out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> on Sunday, he said. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> tried to leave <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Metropolitan Airport on Sunday for Midway, but gave up when her <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight was delayed She returned Monday to face more delays. `` At one point, they said there were 17 planes waiting on the runway, plus I was number 17 on a standby list,'' she said. She and three other people she met at the airport rented a car and drove the nearly 300 miles back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Hopefully, we beat the plane back,'' she said. `` We do n't know.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> named Socialist <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> as premier Tuesday to form a new government following <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s decisive victory in the presidential election. Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> resigned and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> swiftly picked <PERSON> Rochard </PERSON>, a popular politician who describes himself as a `` free-enterprise leftist.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, also a Socialist, defeated the conservative <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in Sunday's presidential election. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> had been premier since his conservative alliance defeated the Socialists in 1986 for control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, who has centrist support, went to his new offices in the Hotel Matignon on the Left Bank early in the evening for the transfer of power. Afterward, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told reporters, `` The president has given me a tough job.'' He said he would form a Cabinet bearing in mind the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people's worries `` for their future, for their jobs, for their education, for their security.'' Under the French constitution, the president is responsible for foreign affairs, defense and guarding the nation's interests abroad, while the premier runs day-to-day government. After meeting with <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> left for the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where he maintains an apartment. He has been mayor since 1977. Under the French system, voters choose a president and a parliament in separate elections. The premier is chosen by the party or parties that wins control of the parliament. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> was appointed Tuesday because <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> resigned. Because his party does not control <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> must form a government with support from outside the Socialist ranks. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who is beginning his second seven-year term as president, has said non-Socialists would be included in the Cabinet. The change of government formally ends `` cohabitation,'' as the French call the uneasy sharing of power by a president and premier of opposing political views. It also marked the first time in 30 years of the <LOCATION> Fifth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> that a government does not have a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by center-right parties that backed <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, 57, is a rival of <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and was prepared to seek the presidency this year until <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> declared his candidacy. As a non-doctrinaire Socialist, however, the former agriculture minister symbolizes the president's effort to appeal to a broader segment of the public. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, profited from a divided right and won 56 percent of the vote in Sunday's election. Presenting himself as unifier of the nation, he won over some centrist politicians who were upset with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s attempts to accommodate the far right. All but renouncing his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> past, the president has promised a policy of `` enlargement'' that is broad enough to satisfy centrists previously aligned with the right but does not alienate the left. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrot </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, one of the parties in the center-right coalition that backed <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s performance would be judged `` without preconceptions.'' `` For us centrists, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s situation and the challenges it must meet demands that no chance for dialogue be overlooked,'' he said. `` One must recognize his -LRB- <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s -RRB- merit in certain situations and his courage when he tried to pull the left out of its dogmatisms and its well-beaten paths.'' Newspaper commentators and political observers had predicted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s choice for premier would be <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, a debonair man long one of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s favorite politicians. He also is known for independent and outspoken views. He resigned as agriculture minister in 1985 because he opposed a system of proportional voting instituted by the Socialists. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the first French president elected twice by universal suffrage, has said he will not dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for new elections immediately, but will try to work with it. His party holds 211 of the 577 seats. Some supporters urge that the president call elections quickly to take advantage of the momentum gained in Sunday's vote. Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, a major figure in the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, has called for a `` constructive opposition.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won the office from him in a close election seven years ago. A former Socialist premier, <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON>, said `` I do n't think the French want a return to 1981,'' referring to the Socialist government that assumed power that year. `` They are for an enlargement,'' he said in a radio interview. `` Excellent things were done in 1981, but time has passed and society has changed. `` The left is no longer an experiment. This is a change with incredible historic dimensions.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> on Tuesday to remove the political officer from its embassy in retaliation for similar action the East Asian nation took last week against an American diplomat. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> was requested to withdraw <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chua </PERSON>, first secretary at the embassy. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> expressed `` hope that we can put this unfortunate episode behind us.'' The tit-for-tat withdrawals started last week when <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> insisted that <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, an American embassy officer, be removed on grounds he had interfered in the domestic affairs of the country. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> had charged that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> met with lawyers opposed to the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> to urge them to run for election and to suggest that financing would be available. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the allegations were `` totally without foundation,'' but that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was compelled to withdraw <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> in keeping with international law that gives nations the right to decide who may be accredited as diplomats. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> values highly its ties with <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, which we have regarded as among our strongest friends in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We are therefore both shocked and puzzled at the allegations which have been made against us, and which, as I have noted, we reject in toto. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made no charges against <PERSON> Chua </PERSON>, whose position in the <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was roughly comparable to the post held in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>. Under the diplomatic concept of `` reciprocity,'' nations that feel their diplomats have been treated unfairly often respond by taking parallel action.

<HEAD>NBC Back On Top As May Sweeps Bring Out New Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> regained first place in the Nielsen ratings as the three major networks, in a bow to the May sweeps, ran mostly original programming last week. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won by a wide margin and took the top nine places, a feat \* unequalled since <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was first the week ending Nov. 3, 1980. `` Cheers'' was in first place and the only non-NBC show to make the Top 10 was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' The abundance of original programming is due to the May sweeps, a period in which the audiences of local television stations are measured to set their advertising rates. Many series episodes, as well as movies and miniseries, were held back for the sweeps. But the new shows will run out soon as the lengthening writers' strike takes its toll on summer shows planned by the networks to freshen up the rerun season. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie and the first half of a miniseries also made the Top 10. `` The Taking of Flight 847: The <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> Story'' was seventh and the opener of `` Something Is Out There'' was ninth. The first half of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Bourne Identity'' placed 11th. It combined with its Sunday competitor on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Something Is Out There'' to knock CBS' `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' to 58th place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> took the week ended May 8 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey with an average rating of 15.6. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which had been first last week, followed with 11.5 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was third with 11.2. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with television. In the separate sweeps measurements, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> took over first place from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which got an enormous boost last week from the final episode of `` Magnum, P.I.'' Here are the ratings in the Nielsen sweeps for April 28-May 8: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 14.9, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 13.1, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.4. Here are the ratings for the <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> sweeps for April 27-May 8: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 14.8, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 12.9, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.7. `` The Cosby Show'' was the only show in the Top 10 that was not original. In fact, it was the only rerun in the top 36 shows of the ratings. Even below that, more than half of the shows are new. Here's the Top 10: `` Cheers,'' `` A Different World,'' `` Night Court,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Monday Movie, `` The Taking of Flight 847: The <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' `` Amen,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Sunday Movie, `` Something Is Out There,'' Part I, all <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' A cliffhanger episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Miami Vice,'' which returned to its old time period of 10 p.m. Friday, was in 23rd place. The CBS movie `` Necessity'' was 22nd and the second half of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Richest Man in the World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis'' was 27th. A new production on CBS of `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' was 58th and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Remembering <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>,'' a documentary on <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, was 60th. Once again, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Max Headroom'' was the lowest-rated network show. Here are the five bottom shows: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Buck <PERSON> James </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hotel,'' CBS' `` <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Ohara'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Max Headroom <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> remained first among the evening news shows. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second again and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was third. The ratings: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.2, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 9.3, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 8.6.

<HEAD>Martinez Signs Legislation Into Law Prohibiting Highway Drinking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Tuesday signed a law prohibiting people from drinking alcoholic beverages while traveling in most vehicles. `` Certainly this is a quantum jump in making the highways safer,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. The law takes effect Oct. 1. Drivers caught thereafter with open containers of alcohol will be subject to $ 52 fines and having points assessed on their licenses. Passengers would be subject to $ 32 fines. Drivers or passengers could be cited if the open container were found anywhere within their reach. An opened container of alcohol would be legal if kept lock a separate compartment or the trunk. Backers of the law have for years expressed outrage that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law let drivers and passengers drink alcoholic beverages while driving even though the state has tough laws against drunken driving. `` It was just a combination of the pressure back home and the carnage on the highways,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, who sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill. `` It's ludicrous for us to have tough DUI laws on our statute books and yet still allow someone to drink and drive in this state.'' However, exempt from the new law will be passengers in a hired vehicle, such as a bus or limousine, or in a recreational vehicle longer than 21 feet. `` Sometimes in getting a law passed certain stipulations are inserted,'' noted <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` I think this is something that is going to require monitoring. If motor homes, all of a sudden, end up with a higher accident rate I think this is something that will have to be revisited.''

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, received an anonymous threatening note six weeks before his apparent suicide, a spokeswoman for the congressman said Tuesday. The message said, `` You can be sure that the fun and games you are having in your boss' office will catch up with you soon. There will be a fall,'' according to a copy provided by <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> as administrative assistant to <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md. <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> apparently leaped to his death from a hotel room in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on May 1, the same day the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported on unorthodox social demands <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> made of male staff members under his supervision in <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s office. Some of the sources for the Post story were disgruntled former <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> workers, and <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the note had been determined by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to have also been the work of an `` aggrieved employee.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the note did not represent a direct threat, she said. The note to <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, received March 15, concluded: `` You have lost sight of your purpose and have become a monster.'' Attached was a newspaper clipping of a brief story about new appeal rights for congressional employees who are suspended or fired. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said that, together with an uncanceled stamp on the envelope the message came in, lead her to believe the note came from one of two or three former <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> employees who still work elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. She said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police, who are investigating <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' apparent suicide, also have widened their probe to include the note The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office still has an open case on the matter, she said. Existence of the note was first reported this week by the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Roll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Call </ORGANIZATION>, and also was reported Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> told the newspaper that he believed a disgruntled employee also was responsible for instigating a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation of alleged misreporting of <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>' income.

<TEXT>
 Anti-communist guerrillas pounded the Afghan capital's residential neighborhoods with rockets, a radio station reported Tuesday, while diplomatic sources said rebels closed in on the country's second largest city. Monday evening's bombardment of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with 17 surface-to-surface rockets killed 23 civilians and wounded 28 people, Afghan radio said. Western diplomatic sources said Indian diplomats had fled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second largest city, <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, as the rebels overran security zones in heavy fighting near the southeastern provincial capital. Its population has dwindled from 200,000 to 20,000 as people fled the eight-year civil war. The capture of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> would represent a major defeat for the forces of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who has vowed to defend his Soviet-backed government after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdraws an estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under an April 14 accord. However, the government commands only about 50,000 troops of its own, and the Pakistani-based guerrilla forces number about 200,000. The Afghan radio broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that one rocket roared into a house in southern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing five members of a family. Six people were killed in a playground in the center of the capital, it said. The report also said some victims were returning home from work. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> condemned the rocket attacks Tuesday, describing them as `` crimes committed by the enemies of peace and peace-loving citizens,'' the broadcast said. Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulabzoi </PERSON> appealed to people to cooperate with the government in `` preventing enemy actions.'' Soviet forces have begun handing over security to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s troops as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prepares for its pullout beginning May 15. Soviet soldiers reportedly had increased security in the face of intense fighting last week in the <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> located between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Hindukush </LOCATION> range. Diplomats, citing colleagues in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said nightly Soviet transport flights at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airports remained heavy, indicating a massive resupply of Afghan forces. Medical staff at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> hospitals were reporting a near-record number of land mine casualties, including refugees and other civilians. Guerrilla leaders estimate there are 5.5 million land mines spread around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet forces intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> government in its war with the guerrillas. On April 22, the guerrillas captured a major Soviet-Afghan garrison at <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION>, just a few steps from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> frontier. It opened a key new supply route for insurgents operating east, north and west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. On Sunday, they claimed to have captured another government post, <LOCATION> Chamkani </LOCATION>, nine miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province.

 About 30,000 senior citizens came to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Tuesday to flex their growing political muscle in the 1988 biennial convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of people gathered in <LOCATION> Cobo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> to hear speeches by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, sex therapist <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Loret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The convention runs through Thursday. But many conventioneers from across the country came to look at exhibits of motor homes and vacation spots, exercise devices and medications. `` It's wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grudzinski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` But all these freebies, we just ca n't pass it up.'' She and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, were part of a two-bus contingent coming from the <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, area to the cnvention on <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s sprawling riverfront convention center. `` I'm tired, I could use a little scooter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said while relaxing near a stage in the main exhibit hall where entertainment was about to begin. While here, the two women and thousands of others had the opportunity to attend seminars and hear speeches on consumer `` rip-offs'' and patient rights, the federal budget and sexuality among seniors by <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>. During the convention, delegates will vote on a number of resolutions that are not binding on the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,600 local chapters. The organization will issue no political endorsements. But Mrs. <PERSON> Grudzinski </PERSON> said she did n't agree with the national organization's non-partisan policy. `` There's so many of us,'' she said, `` that if we'd all stick together, we could really get things done.'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> told a room packed with more than 2,000 conventioneers that they should watch out for fraud in prosthetic devices, telephone solicitations, prepared food and pharmaceuticals. <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON> told a group there were opportunities for senior citizens in the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. She said <PERSON> Odilon </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> just retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> at 86, leaving 76-year-old <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Klepper </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> as the oldest volunteer. She said the proportion of senior citizens in the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has risen from 6 percent in 1961 to 12 percent now. `` Age is respected in countries where we work,'' she said, adding that senior citizens' biggest problem with acceptance in the program is health, and a difficulty in learning a foreign language. `` At the present moment, most of our seniors are serving in English-speaking countries,'' she said. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, who is running for re-election as the state's senior senator in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, repeated his call for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign recently debated trade legislation and to break the Social Security system out of the federal budget process.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen landed a record catch of 6.9 billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year, breaking the previous record of 6.5 billion pounds set in 1980, the government said Tuesday. The 1987 catch, valued at $ 3.1 billion, was up 865 million pounds from the 1986 total of 6 billion pounds, worth $ 2.8 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. Fishermen received an average of 45 cents a pound for their fish last year. American fishermen who land their catches at ports outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or sold their fish at sea in joint venture operations harvested an additional 4.1 billion pounds, worth $ 454 million, in 1987. The government said increased catches of menhaden, at 2.7 billion pounds, and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pollock, at 552 million pounds, contributed to the 1987 increase. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pollock catch was up 323 percent over 1986. Landings of tuna, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> cod, crabs and scallops were also up. The shrimp harvest fell from 400.2 million pounds in 1986 to 363.1 million pounds, worth $ 578 million, last year. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> led all states in volume with a catch of 1.8 billion pounds.

<HEAD>Personnel Changes May Affect Communist Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s increasingly divided <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> met Tuesday to discuss reforms that may affect top-level officials as pressure mounted for the party's leader to resign The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> cited `` personnel changes'' as one of two items on the agenda of a May 20 session of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to a communique issued at the end of the one-day session. The meeting focused on a draft document on political and economic changes authored by party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, according to the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who turns 76 on May 26, has been blamed by party loyalists and dissidents alike for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and his apparent reluctance to endorse sweeping political reform. Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a leading contender for <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s position, has said the political future of the party boss may be up for debate at a national party conference May 20-22. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has led the party since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> quashed an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. He has said he would step down if asked, but has given little indication he intends to relinquish control soon. Tuesday's meeting was to elect a special committee that will deal with personnel matters at the conference, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told reporters while on a visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last week. `` In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending the conference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and if these changes include the person of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, he will accept the decision,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said on Friday, according to <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, four outspoken advocates of political reform and dialogue with non-party activists were abruptly expelled from the Communist ranks. That move was seen as a sign that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and his followers, who are reportedly locked in a debate over who should retire first, still wield clout among the nation's 880,000 Communists. However, pressure is growing for <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s resignation, with younger party officials anxious to assume power and citizens complaining about government austerity measures. With a foreign debt of more than $ 17 billion, this nation of 10.6 million people has Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest per capita debt. Inflation is running at more than 15 percent, and is likely to go higher following a decision April 1 to liberalize state controls on 80 percent of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s retail prices. The draft paper for the May 20 conference goes far in dealing with these complaints. In it, the Communist party formally accepts blame for the current economic hardships and considers granting limited political reforms such as secret ballots and limited terms in party office. But some critics of the paper have demanded that party members stick rigidly to Communist policy in public statements. The demand is seen as an attack on leading reformist <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Communist establishment's foremost proponent of reform. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> has said he found support in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his ideas and wants to see the government initiate referendums for change, as well as guarantee independence in Hungarian for special interest groups. The arguments of reformists like <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> have been bolstered in recent months by the growing number of economists who are advocating market reforms as the only way out of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s growing economic crisis.

<TEXT>
 A court-appointed official found <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> misspent up to $ 200,000 collected for her son's unsuccessful liver transplants, but she angrily denied the charges Tuesday, calling them `` crazy.'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' 7-year-old son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, died at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> last year after a highly publicized fund-raising drive that included a $ 1,000 donation from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Geivers </PERSON>, appointed at the request of the Dade state attorney's office to review Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' spending, cited a series of questionable expenses paid from the donations. Among the payments were $ 10,850 to a jewelry store, $ 23,700 to Ms. DeSillers' ex-boyfriend, and $ 96,527 in cash withdrawals for personal expenses. At an appeal Tuesday before a state administrative examiner over a $ 1,000 state fine levied on Ms. DeSillers, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Office accused her of misleading the public. `` I do n't think that the people who donated money intended that the money for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> should go for cars, the rent, jewelry and certain other expenditures,'' <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> told hearing examiner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. `` We can not allow people to raise money for one purpose and go against that purpose for personal benefit.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> will take the testimony and documents under consideration and make a decision on the fine within 30 days, said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>. After the hearing, Ms. <PERSON> DeSiller </PERSON>'s lashed out at the report. `` I'm not saying I'm perfect,'' she said. `` But ... how could she say on there that I know the law and I disregarded it. It's crazy. The report by Ms. <PERSON> Geivers </PERSON> acknowledged that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> had suffered a `` great personal tragedy'' with her son's death. But it added `` she appears to have ignored the laws ... when it suited her purposes to do so.'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has said the questionable expenditures were necessary to raise money for an organ donation awareness program. She said some of the money went to help her keep up a `` professional appearance'' while soliciting funds as president of the now-dormant <ORGANIZATION> Ronnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeSillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. And she said the jewelry expense was to buy back items she had pawned to pay <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s medical expenses and payments to her brother and boyfriend <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> were to repay loans. `` <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> spent more than twice that helping <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and I,'' she said. `` He lost two businesses when he came to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 1988 harvests could produce 215 million metric tons of grain, up 2 percent from last year's bumper output of 211.4 million tons, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday In its first forecast of this year's Soviet grain production, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the harvests could include 92 million tons of wheat, 109 million tons of coarse grains such as rye, barley, oats and corn; and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains and pulses, which include peas and beans. The report said the harvest outlook could mean a cutback in grain imports, particularly wheat. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been selling the Soviets huge quantities of wheat lately, all of it at subsidized prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. If the 1988 harvest turns out as forecast, it would be the third straight year that Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons, an unprecedented feat in that country. It also would be the third-largest Soviet grain output, exceeded by the record crop of 237.4 million tons in 1978 and the 1976 harvest of 223.8 million tons. Officials said the 1988 forecast is `` highly tentative'' and that it `` will be modified as the season progresses by both positive and negative factors, including weather developments.'' Total grain area was estimated at 116 million hectares, slightly more than last year's 115.2 million hectares. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn. One hectare is equal to about 2.47 acres. `` The improved outlook for the 1988 U.S.S.R. grain crop, particularly wheat, is expected to reduce total grain import needs in 1988-89,'' the report said. `` This year's coarse grain crop is projected at 109 million tons, somewhat below last year's large harvest.'' Therefore, it said, total Soviet wheat imports could decline to 15 million tons in the international marketing year that begins on July 1 from 22 million tons in 1987-88. That would be the lowest level in nine years. But imports of coarse grain, at a forecast of 10 million tons in 1988-89, would be about the same as the last two years. Total grain imports, including wheat, coarse grains and miscellaneous grains, could fall to 26 million tons in 1988-89 from 32.5 million tons this season. Analysts said much will depend on the quality of the Soviet's 1988 wheat harvest and how competively priced lower-quality feed wheat is relative to other grains used for livestock feed In 1986, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last harvested 92 million tons of wheat _ the 1987 crop was 83.3 million tons _ it included much low-quality grain, which prompted large imports of higher quality <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. A similar problem with poor quality in the 1987 harvest triggered further imports of higher quality <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, all of it sold at subsidized prices under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements. Moreover, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are still negotiating a long-term grain agreement to replace the current five-year pact that expires on Sept. 30. The agreement would continue the practice of specifying minimum amounts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn to be bought by the Soviets each year.

<HEAD>Consumer Interests Lose Opening Skirmish Over House Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Consumer interests lost the opening skirmish Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee action on a politically sensitive bill that they fear will make it harder for victims injured by unsafe products to recover damages from manufacturers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, taking the first votes on the product liability bill after months of internal wrangling, decisively defeated two consumer-backed amendments offered by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., and then adjourned until Thursday The bill would provide a uniform federal standard of product liability sought by the business community to pre-empt conflicting state laws. Consumer activists vigorously oppose the measure on the ground that it would jeopardize the legal rights of victims of hazardous consumer products. Much of the first day of committee debate focused on complex legal questions raised by what Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, called a `` complex and extremely controversial'' bill. Its chances of passage in an election year are considered highly unlikely. A similar bill died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986 after a filibuster led by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman who remains a staunch foe of any such legislation. At the request of Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., drafted a plan aimed at making a compromise bill approved by <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s subcommittee last December more palatable to consumer groups and moderate committee But <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s amendments drew sniping from all sides Tuesday, prompting Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., to predict a flood of proposed changes that might include some `` venomous snakes'' further threatening the bill's prospects `` This is a watered-down bill, but it is better than none,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, charging that `` we are about to emasculate the product liability system,'' proposed to expand the bill's narrow list of federal legal grounds for damage suits by consumers against manufacturers of defective products. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s two proposed amendments to the <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> plan were rejected on roll call votes of 29-12 and 30-12, with <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> voting both times with opponents. Under the subcommittee bill, originally introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, a manufacturer could escape liability for damages if he did not know _ or could not know _ of a design defect with knowledge `` reasonably available'' to him, or if there were no feasible alternative design. This restriction on liability would not apply if the consumer could establish that the product was egregiously unsafe, that an ordinary consumer would not know of the product's risks and if the product had little or no usefulness. The <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> plan would require only that the plaintiff prove that the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should not have been marketed. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> also would put the burden of proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible. Leaders of four consumer organizations wrote <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> on April 27 to complain that the <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> plan `` still falls far short of protecting the legal rights of individuals injured by unreasonably dangerous and defective products.'' They said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s amendments would weaken the legal doctrine of `` strict liability'' used by most states. That doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the manufacturer's alleged misconduct to the product itself, relieving the courts of proving what a manufacturer knew or should have known about its product. In a separate May 2 letter to each committee member, the consumer groups said the bill would make it `` more difficult, and in some cases impossible, for victims of defective products to recover their losses from those responsible for such defects,'' and would reduce manufacturers' incentives to produce safer products.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday he has not ruled out pardoning former aides <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> for any crimes in the Iran-Contra affair, but he indicated he would not do it before a verdict in their trials. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded with an emphatic `` no'' when asked by a reporter whether he had ruled out granting pardons to North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. He did not elaborate, simply turning and walking from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, where he had presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> for his work as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary general. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment came one day after he told an interviewer that it would be wrong to grant any pardons before the trial is over, and suggested he would be out of office when that happens. Previously, the president has hinted he is leaning toward a pardon for <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, saying he did not think they were guilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> went to the Oval Office to consult with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about his remark Tuesday. Afterward, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president had understood the question and gave the answer he wanted. `` It means there's been no decision'' on pardons, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I would n't assume that any definitive judgment has been made.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> made public <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s response when syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> asked him in an interview Monday whether he would pardon North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. `` You ca n't consider that, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, until this case has been closed, whichever way it's going to go,'' the president said. `` To pardon somebody before trial leaves a sense of guilt around them, a cloud of guilt for the rest of time. And so this is something that I do n't have to face.'' The timing of the Iran-Contra trial is uncertain. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has said he would like to start as early as June, though lawyers for North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> have said they would like to delay it until next year. Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has proposed starting the trial in September. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends next Jan. 20. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, and <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member, have been charged along with arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> with conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered that <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> be allowed to examine thousands of pages of especially sensitive government documents that may be relevant to their defense. Government security officials had refused to allow either defendant to inspect the sensitive material. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, an Iranian-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, has never had a security clearance; <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, has not been cleared for access to classified information since he left the government several years ago. But the judge ruled that `` no basis exists for depriving either of these defendants of their right to determine the relevance and materiality of classified materials involved in this case.'' Lawyers for <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, however, waived their clients' right to inspect between 35 and 70 sensitive documents to verify prosecution claims the material is irrelevant to the case

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has refused to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to inspect the missiles the Saudis bought secretly from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1986, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Tuesday. But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` completely satisfied'' with assurances given by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> that the missiles would not be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads. He told a congressional hearing the assurances were made both orally and in a letter from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahd </LOCATION> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Despite those assurances, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still would like to inspect the missile sites and was continuing to discuss that possibility with the Saudis, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. But another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said he was doubtful the Saudis would change their minds. Defense analysts argue that the conventional missiles could be converted easily for use as nuclear or chemical arms. But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the hearing that by agreeing last month to sign the International Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was precluding the missiles' conversion to nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> conceded, in response to questioning, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies had failed to detect the 1986 deal for the sale of the CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles which have a range of up to 1,800 miles. `` We had no firm fix on it until January -LRB- 1988 -RRB- and nothing definite until March,'' he told a joint hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the subcommittee on arms control, international security and science. The Chinese missiles being deployed in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> desert are not accurate weapons and `` in our view, they also do not improve the security of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. But the Saudis feel differently, particularly in view of the threat from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been at odds for several years and the tensions culminated last month in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> decision to cut off diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was testifying on behalf of the administration's proposal to sell the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> a $ 325 million package of maintenance and training for U.S.-made AWACS radar surveillance planes. The five planes were supplied to the Saudis last year under a 1981 contract. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> also was lobbying for the sale of 200 <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> fighting vehicles, equipped with anti-tank TOW missiles, worth $ 500 million. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejects the sale, the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> `` will go elsewhere.'' He noted that when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> turned down the sale of F-15 fighter jets to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in 1985, the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> signed a $ 12 billion contract with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for Tornado fighters. `` We lost business and influence,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> uses the U.S.-supplied AWACS for aerial patrols to protect American naval forces against Iranian attacks in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The Saudis also allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to their ports and air bases, and provide F-15 fighter jet protection for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AWACS flights over the northern part of the gulf, he said. The two sales before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` are clearly in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. More than 180 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and 58 Senators have asked Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to block the Saudi sales pending clarifications of the Chinese missile purchase.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Crop Reported at 1.62 Billion Bushels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers soon will be harvesting a winter wheat crop estimated at 1.62 billion bushels, up 4 percent from last year's production, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The first forecast of the season, based on surveys May 1, compared with a 1987 winter wheat output of 1.56 billion bushels. The average yield was estimated at 40.7 bushels per harvested acre, up from last year's 39.8 bushels per acre. Farmers are expected to have about 39.8 million acres for harvest this year, up 1 percent from 39.3 million in 1987, the report said. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production. No 1988 production estimates for spring wheat, corn and other major spring-planted crops were included. Those will be issued by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> later in the growing season. The outlook for wheat prices at the farm also has brightened, reflecting brisk export demand and a reduction in once-awesome <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles. In a related supply-and-demand report, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected total wheat production this year, based on historical trends, at 2.17 billion bushels, up slightly from 2.1 billion bushels in 1987. That would include winter wheat and other kinds planted this spring for harvest in 1988. The report also projected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile to decline further to around 796 million bushels by the end of the coming marketing year on May 31, 1989, compared with more than 1.23 billion bushels of old-crop wheat expected to be carried over this June 1. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asssociation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said the expected reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat inventories will mean tighter supplies in the year ahead. Does that mean the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is running low on wheat after the recent years of huge surpluses? `` That's relatively correct,'' <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said. `` And if we're going to stay in the world -LRB- export -RRB- market, we're going to have to have adequate supplies for our customers That's why we feel the acreage reserve level can be relaxed and farmers can have the opportunity to market more bushels in the 1989 season.'' <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> referred to a farm law provision that limits <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to no more than a 20 percent land-idling requirement when the wheat stockpile is projected to drop below a billion bushels. At a projected 796 million bushels on May 31, 1989, that would be well below the mark. For the last two years, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has required wheat farmers to idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for supports and other federal benefits. <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said the association wants to see the 1989 requirement reduced to between 10 percent and 20 percent. Wheat market prices were projected for 1988-89 at an average range of $ 2.80 to $ 3.20 per bushel, compared with $ 2.55 estimated for 1987-88. The indicated production of winter wheat, based on May 1, prospects, are listed here. The first numbers show the total production in thousands of bushels. The second numbers are the average yields per acre for the major states.

The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said there have been no incidents or threats that prompted the change. However, he said, `` there comes a point in all of this when <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection is necessary, and in my judgment I've arrived at that point.'' Campaign aides said the timing was the result of several considerations, including <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' increasing prominence near the end of what has become a two-man Democratic race with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In addition, aides said there was some concern inside the campaign about the potential for violence in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, particularly in light of recent publicity marking 20 years since the assassination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> after his victory in the 1968 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic primary. The protection, provided round the clock at taxpayer expense, is to begin Wednesday when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leaves for a campaign trip through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, en route to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The governor told reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> briefing that he met recently with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents to review procedures. `` They understand my lifestyle and the fact that we do n't have governor's mansions in this state,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, stressing his concern for his and his family's privacy. Asked if reporters would continue to enjoy access to the candidate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I certainly hope so. ... I do n't know why it should change.'' `` Kitty and I have been very, very lucky. For 25 years we've been deeply involved in public life, and we've been able to do it with a remarkably normal personal and family life,'' he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to continue riding the trolley to work from his home in suburban <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has had Secret Service protection for months, and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the apparent Republican nominee, has been protected throughout his term.

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces Sale Of Maritime Patrol Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that it had approved the sale of three P-3C <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> maritime surveillance planes to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Assuming there are no congressional objections, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would be allowed to purchase the three aircraft along with spare parts, ground support facilities and training services for an estimated $ 240 million. The Orion is a propeller-driven plane used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for long-range sea patrols and the detection of submarines. The announced sale of three of the planes comes just two months after neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s arch foe _ leased a nuclear-powered attack submarine from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> already had eight Soviet-made Foxtrot diesel submarines, which date to the 1960s; two newer Russian Kilo diesel subs, and two advanced <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> diesel submarines known as HDW Type 209's. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> insisted in a statement that the sale of the P-3s to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` will not affect the basic military balance in the region.'' But it added: `` This purchase will permit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to enhance its surveillance and anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the prime contractors would be the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diesel-Allison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turbine </ORGANIZATION> division in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. Beyond seeking maritime patrol aircraft, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also has been pressing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for E-3 AWACS early-warning radar planes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has countered by suggesting that the Pakistanis consider the smaller and less expensive E-2C <LOCATION> Hawkeye </LOCATION> flown by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> became interested in an early-warning radar plane because of repeated incursions by Soviet aircraft into its airspace near neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A five-member <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation arrived Tuesday to open talks that could produce a cultural agreement for signing at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The agreement, formally called a `` program document,'' would go into effect at the end of the year, replacing an accord signed after the first summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, was to deliver the opening remarks at the start of the talks on Thursday, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemming </PERSON>. The Soviet delegation was to remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a week. Soviet officials have said they expect the agreement, which sets out the specifics of cultural and educational exchanges, to be ready for the summit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials have said there is little prospect for an arms control agreement during the summit, which will mark <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first visit to the land he once called an `` evil empire.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were cautious about prospects for a cultural agreement. `` Let's not get our hopes up too high,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION>, the main American agency involved in the talks. `` We would like to see progress in improving relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but there is no guarantee that a signing of this document will take place in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. `` What is important is that by Dec. 31, we have agreed on a solid document which will advance exchanges between the two countries.'' The Soviet delegation was headed by <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON>, the first deputy chief of the foreign <ORGANIZATION> mininstry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> for humanitarian and cultural relations, said <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. Cultural and educational exchanges between the superpowers slowed to a trickle after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in response to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, allowed an earlier pact to lapse in 1980. The exchanges resumed in earnest after the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet relations improved and Soviet society began to open up under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has since announced his intention to withdraw Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the two leaders agreed in principle to sign a cultural exchange agreement lasting six years, and their aides worked out a three-year program document that expires at the end of the year. The envisioned program document would last the additional three years spelled out in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Federal Audit Cuts Pensions for More Than 100,000 Government
Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> auditors said Tuesday more than 104,000 retired government workers are paying the price for a 1977 law that curbed Social Security spouse's benefits for civil servants. Most of those retirees have lost all of their Social Security benefits, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. It said Social Security's master beneficiary record for last January showed that three-quarters of those affected were men. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted the measure to eliminate what lawmakers regarded as a windfall for civil servants who were not covered themselves by Social Security, but who wound up receiving benefits through their spouses. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said 104,608 workers had their benefits reduced as a result of the audit. The agency said 71 percent of the federal workers checked were drawing an average yearly pension of $ 16,944. Most had their Social Security benefits eliminated entirely, costing those workers an average of $ 178 a month or $ 2,136 a year. The law reduces the Social Security spousal or survivor's benefits of a government retiree by $ 2 for every $ 3 of public pension It applies only to government workers not covered on their own jobs by Social Security. Most civil servants _ including all federal workers hired since 1984 _ are covered by Social Security. For most families, Social Security pays spouses' benefits to elderly husbands or wives regardless of whether they contributed to the system. An elderly spouse can draw a benefit half as large as the working spouse's; if she survives him, she receives the larger of the two benefits.

<HEAD>Congressman Urges More Testing, Inspections Of Older Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government should require more extensive inspections and structural testing of older commercial jetliners to help deal with the `` black hole of aviation safety,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said Tuesday `` It is a matter of extreme danger to the flying public and something that needs to be addressed now,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, a member and former chairman of the Science, Space and Technology subcommittee on aviation. At a news conference, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said current inspection requirements by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> were inadequate. He said he plans to introduce legislation soon to force the agency to expand its efforts. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said his criticisms were prompted by the recent accident in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> involving an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, which lost part of its upper fuselage at 24,000 feet. Federal investigators have found evidence of cracks caused by metal fatigue on the remaining fuselage. He expressed concern that more accidents could occur with older planes. `` I fear that we're going to see in the next year a whole slew of these kinds of problems occur,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>. `` These can be prevented but right now barring some form of aggressive <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> role in older planes I fear some catastrophes occurring in American aviation.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, took issue with <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>'s remarks about safety He also said the agency had started an extra inspection program for older planes. `` We believe that when inspections are done, both the regular inspections and supplemental inspections, and any necessary corrections are made, the aircraft are safe,'' said <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. Underlying <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>'s concern is the question of how long a jetliner can safely remain in operation. In particular, the congressman said he was concerned that many older planes were being used far more intensively than manufacturers originally envisioned, subjecting them to greater stress from repeated landings, takeoffs and pressurizations. Last week, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> lawmaker sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> urging a program of regular structural inspections for all older jetliners. At the news conference, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for not conducting more research to determine the structural and technological lifespans of airliners. He said the government agency should have a regular program of `` destructive'' testing, in which it purchases older planes and tears them down to determine the effects of normal wear and tear. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said he would propose legislation to require the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> along with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to develop state-of-the-art inspection techniques. Currently, visual and X-ray inspections are used for older planes. `` There is an old saying that goes, ` What you do n't know ca n't hurt you. In the case of old aircraft flying around our skies, what you do n't know can kill you,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Security Forces Told To Shoot Anyone Leaving Golden Temple</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 2,500 security troops surrounding the Golden Temple complex were ordered Tuesday to shoot anyone trying to leave, police said. Officers said the order was given after more than 800 people, at least half of them women and children, were evacuated from the shrine during a lull in fighting between the troops and armed Sikh extremists holed up in the complex. Members of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, carrying automatic rifles and light machine guns, encircled the 400-year-old Golden Temple. Some were posted on rooftops. Others were concealed behind barricades. The two sides resumed intermittent fire for about two hours after the evacuation. After 1 p.m., no return fire was heard from the militants. Security forces kept up occasional fire until sundown, usually whenever a Sikh appeared briefly over the walls of the sprawling compound. Seven Indian reporters and photographers, who spent most of Monday trapped inside the complex, emerged late Monday night and said at least 100 militants with automatic rifles were inside. One casualty was reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Dilbagh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 31-year-old Sikh who was among the evacuees, was shot in the leg. He told a reporter he was wounded while walking toward the temple's inner sanctum with two Sikh militants. The entire city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, with a population of about 800,000, was under curfew Monday and Tuesday. Residents were told to stay indoors. There was no word whether police planned to storm the temple. The siege began Monday after an exchange of fire between Sikhs inside the temple and security troops killed at least five people and wounded 10. The Golden Temple is the main stronghold of Sikhs demanding an independent homeland or greater autonomy for <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, which includes <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Although a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s total population of 800 million. The Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who make up 82 percent of the nationwide population. Most of the evacuees were pilgrims who had gone to the temple Monday to celebrate the anniversary of the day in the 17th century when <PERSON> Hargobind </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was installed as the sixth guru of the Sikh faith. Much of the security troops' fire Tuesday afternoon was directed at a watch tower overlooking the main temple entrance. Shots rang out whenever men appeared in the tower in their highly visible, saffron-colored turbans, the headgear of Sikh men. No Sikhs were seen returning fire and reporters could not tell if any of them were hit. An officer at a machine gun post outside the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> said he had orders to fire at anyone seen atop the tower or trying to escape. `` We have them under control for now, but they also have their weapons trained on us,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state Police Chief K.P.S. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said it was impossible for any militant to escape the cordon. `` We have drawn up a very tight ring,'' he said. The temple complex has at least 17 exits. In a half-dozen places the boundary wall is low enough to jump over. `` The decision -LRB- whether to storm the temple -RRB- has to come from the top, but we are ready,'' said <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqui </PERSON>, deputy inspector of police. Most Sikhs would view any such action as a desecration. Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s decision to storm the temple in June 1984 to oust militants led to her assassination by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> bodyguards that same year. The militants' violent campaign for an independent homeland began in 1982 and has claimed at least 940 lives in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year.

<HEAD>Envoy Says Some US Consulates To Be Closed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Panamanian President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> has ordered the closing of a number of Panamanian consulates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an opposition leader said Tuesday. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has remained loyal to ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, said most of the consulates informed of the move were staffed by personnel who also are <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> supporters. He said money that the pro-Delvalle consulates had been receiving from official services had been placed in escrow accounts rather than being sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, like <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, does not recognize the legitimacy of the <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> government and had no comment on the reported action. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the offices received word they were being shut down on Monday. They include offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said. It was unclear whether pro-Delvalle diplomats would attempt to keep the consulates operating despite the shutdown order. Panamanian sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the Panamanian government stopped short of ordering home the diplomats affected by the shutdowns.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Plan That Might Lead to Some Military Base
Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, trying to decide what to do with one of its most sacred cows, voted approval of a plan Tuesday that eventually could mean some of the nation's 3,600 military installations may be shut down. `` This is the stickiest wicket in this bill,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., as he acknowledged the political sensitivity of the base-closing provision, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill now on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor The plan, approved on an 83-13 vote, provides for the creation of a 15-member commission that will review the nation's 3,600 military facilities to determine which of them can be closed. The panel's report will be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> by next Dec. 31, and he will then have 15 days to either accept or reject all the commission recommendations. That means <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who supports the base-closing plan, might order closures only five days before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office. Military bases mean jobs, and for more than a decade, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has effectively blocked the closure of any bases by requiring lengthy, detailed environmental studies about proposed base closings. Pentagon officials have estimated that closing unneeded military bases could save between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion a year. `` There is a perception in the country, and I think it's accurate, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not act to close a single base because of the political ramifications,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>. `` It's time some bases went, no matter whose state they are in Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, agreed. He noted that `` the real issue is one that concerns each of us _ and that is the potential loss of jobs in our states and resulting economic dislocations. ... These are very real concerns.'' The commission plan was first proposed as a way to take <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> off the hook for recommending which bases should be closed. But the original plan was to create a nine-member commission, which was tentatively announced last week by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. That ran into opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where some legislators said a congressional voice was needed for such a panel. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> originally proposed adding six <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members to the commission, but that idea was dropped during a long day of backstage negotiations. Finally, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> approved a compromise plan that would have <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> appoint six more members, for a total of 13. The final six would be named after <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> consults with key legislators. The plan also includes a provision that any action by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> could only be blocked if both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to do so. `` Our communities rely on these bases,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` When these bases are closed, it better not look political. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> supported the congressionally approved members as a way to add credibility to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> panel which legislators fear will base its findings on previous <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> studies of which bases should be closed. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> agreed that closing installations is sensitive, but added, `` I hope we can close some ... I know there are some that are unneeded.'' The commission plan is not part of the House version of its defense bill, which that chamber is scheduled to finally approve on Wednesday. House leaders say it will be considered soon in separate legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bills which will be approved separately in each chamber eventually will go to a conference committee to reconcile differences, including the base-closing plan. Both bills authorize $ 299.5 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

 American union officials Tuesday displayed a red and white banner reading `` Break Chains on <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Free Union'' on the building across the street from the Soviet Embassy. `` We are here, this sign is here, to support the Polish workers in their fight to have free trade unions,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bywater </PERSON>, president of the 200,000-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION>, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers -LRB- IUE -RRB-. `` At the same time we are sending a message to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about their client state _ and they talk about changes, more democracy. If they are the worker state they are not treating the workers very well,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> building has constantly displayed a banner, a `` Solidarnosc'' -LRB- Solidarity -RRB- flag or both since 1983. <PERSON> Bywater </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that the union's support of the workers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was shared throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor movement. He said he will ask <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> members to send financial support to the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group developed to aid the outlawed Solidarity labor movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mroczyk </PERSON>, president of the endowment, said the group hoped to raise $ 1 million in the next year to aid the families of jailed Polish workers, send machinery, clothes, supplies and to support publications. `` We want to send a very strong signal to Solidarity and to the people of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, that they are not alone. They have not been forgotten,'' <PERSON> Mroczyk </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> action coincided with the current wave of strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that began April 25. It has been <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst period of labor unrest since martial law was declared and Solidarity outlawed in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> Local 201 board member <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Kris </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarnecki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as a child in 1965. He said his uncles had to return this week because the Polish government would not let their families leave. `` This morning they said they were going to give -LRB- the workers -RRB- a raise. But you ca n't buy anything with it, there's no food there to buy,'' he said. `` My uncle <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> was part of the Solidarity in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> but on a very limited level. Everybody's afraid. The government is after them on every corner. If they are not after the people themselves they are their wives or whatever. They live in constant fear,'' <PERSON> Czarnecki </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Before he left, my uncle said to me, ` You can chain us, but you ca n't chain our hearts,''' he said. Shipyard workers in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> ended their strike without settlement on Tuesday, but a sixth strike was expected to begin Monday at a tractor factory on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>.

 Reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> grinned and raised his hand in a victory salute Tuesday after a jury acquitted him and eight associates of the slaying of rival <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>. `` Not guilty,'' forewoman <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Minze </PERSON> intoned 27 times to the charges of murder, conspiracy and possession of an instrument of crime, three counts for each defendant. Friends and relatives in the crowded City Hall courtroom cheered, wept and applauded. `` I love the American judicial system,'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said afterwards. He had been in court every day, with other relatives, supporting his jailed father, an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, cement contractor said by authorities to head the Philadelphia-southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mob. The regional crime family has been decimated in the past decade by bloody internal warfare, arrests and convictions. <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>'s body was found Sept. 14, 1984, in a wooded area near a highway in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The 59-year-old <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, nattily attired in a navy gabardine suit, has been in prison since his arrest in January 1987 for conspiring to extort $ 1 million from a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> developer. He is serving a 15-year sentence for that crime. The acquittal was the second court victory in six months for <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, who was cleared in December on drug charges. Stunned by the verdict, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> asked that the jury be polled. Ms. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> had described <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> as `` an organized-crime executioner'' who marked mob members for immediate death when they questioned his authority. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, was elated with the verdict _ the second case in a row that he had won acquittal for his client and other mob members. The defendants had been accused of criminal activities by two ex-gangsters who turned government informants because, they said, <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> had ordered them killed. In December, <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> was found innocent of federal drug racketeering charges, and the chief evidence against him and six associates came from <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON>, who had successfully testified against him in an extortion case. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> branded the two former mobsters as liars and admitted murderers who could not be believed. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said the latest acquittals were `` a signal to the whole country that you just do n't persecute people because of their alleged associations and activities. The office of District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said, in a brief statement, `` We really do n't have any comment beyond the fact that we are obviously disappointed.''

 An engineer killed in a commuter train crash last month had traces of marijuana in his system, and a dispatcher's urine showed traces of morphine and codeine, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Tests showed that three other <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> employees connected to the collision also had drugs in their systems, the agency said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, agency chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> called for mandatory random drug testing of railroad employees. He said that in the past 16 months, rail accidents in which at least one employee tested positive for drugs have occurred at a rate of one every 10 days. `` This insanity has got to stop,'' he said. The morphine traces found in dispatcher <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON>'s urine `` are comparable to those which could be expected following heroin use,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Brott </PERSON>, an agency spokesman. The engineer, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, was killed when his train slammed into the rear of another empty commuter train April 6 in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, resident tested positive for marijuana in his urine and his blood, the agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> officials have blamed <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 42, for failing to activate an automatic safety system that could have prevented the collision. They also have said the train appeared to be traveling well over the 15 mph speed limit when the accident occurred. The other employees who tested positive for narcotics _ block operators <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Faber </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and leverman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> _ have been absolved of responsibility for the crash, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yule </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the men, was out of his office Tuesday and could not immediately be reached for comment. <PERSON> Faber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> showed traces of butalbital, a barbiturate, in their urine and blood, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had traces marijuana in his, according to the FRA. Like dispatcher <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON>, they were suspended after the accident and now face a disciplinary hearing on charges based on the drug test results. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> declined to say if the tests indicated whether drugs might have affected the men's performances. He said a final report on the accident, to be released in about two months, `` will determine the role drug use played in the incident.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lappas </PERSON>, a professor in <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s department of forensic sciences, said it was difficult to determine, based on the amounts of drugs found in the men's systems, whether any of them was under the influence of drugs at the time of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> employees found to have used drugs on the job must enter a substance abuse program or face dismissal. They also are subject to spot drug testing while in the program.

<TEXT>
 A bill authorizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join 76 other countries as a signatory to a 102-year-old treaty on copyright protection of literary and artistic works was approved unanimously Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The vote on the so-called Berne Convention was 420-0. Separate legislation ratifying the treaty is awaiting action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to vote within the next few months. Supporters of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adherence to the treaty say it will provide improved copyright protection for American creative works, including computer technology and musical records and tapes, against foreign piracy and counterfeiting. The bill lacks a `` moral rights'' provision sought primarily by movie directors and screenwriters to prevent colorizing and other alterations in films sold to television broadcasters. To conform with the treaty, the bill changes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyright law to eliminate a requirement that to have copyright protection, a published work must indicate that it is copyrighted. Such a designation henceforth would be voluntary. The bill clarifies that `` pictorial, graphic and sculptural works'' receiving copyright protection include architectural plans. The measure also would replace compulsory jukebox licenses with voluntary negotiations between jukebox operators and composers of copyrighted music for payment of royalties and fees, with a provision for compulsory licenses if negotiations fail.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesay it had singled out areas in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> for further study of contamination caused by irrigation drainage water. The four areas are the <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Stillwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> irrigation project in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The department's announcement gave few specifics on its researchers' findings of contaminants in water, sediment and wildlife tissue. The information compiled during two years of research is available in larger reports, which were not distributed with the announcement. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said, `` Some localized problems related to irrigation drainage water do exist.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> also said, `` The more detailed work we will undertake will provide the scientific understanding necessary to mitigate or resolve the problems we have found.'' Researchers were looking for trace elements, notably selenium easily liberated from many Western soils; radioactivity; pesticide residues and other chemicals. Selenium is a trace element necessary for nutrition in minute amounts but toxic in larger doses. Extraordinarily high concentrations were put in the <ORGANIZATION> Kesterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by drain water from the Westlands Water District, forcing the closing of the drain after large-scale deaths of waterfowl. The one-page summaries released Tuesday provided some data only for the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> area, and the significance of those findings was not explained. Summaries also were released for the <ORGANIZATION> Laguna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atascosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; the Milk and Sun river irrigation projects in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tulare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the Lower <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. At these areas, more sampling will be done but `` not on as intensive a basis,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>. Groundwater drains at <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> contained selenium in concentrations of 14 to 140 parts per billion; carp taken from the lake contained 31 parts per million; the livers of coots taken from the lake showed selenium of 4.9 to 26 ppm and averaged 32 ppm from coots at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roadside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>; water in the pond contained as much as 93 ppm selenium. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> authorities warn that selenium concentrations above 2 ppm or 2,000 ppb in food can be dangerous to pregnant women and children under 15. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> limits drinking water concentrations to 0.01 ppm or 10 ppb. The summary for <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said selenium concentrations were `` elevated at several locations.'' Snow said the larger report showed the median concentration of 24 ground and surface water samples was 7.5 ppb. Detailed reports of the <LOCATION> Salton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> areas will not be avilable until later this year because additional sampling was undertaken there, the department said. No summaries for those areas were released. The Lower <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> summary said `` average selenium concentrations in fish approach, and in some instances exceed, concentrations that could result in reproductive impairment in certain fish'' but `` agricultural practicies in the Lower <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> do not at this time appear to increase selenium concentrations.'' DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, the pesticide banned 16 years ago, also was found. Researchers in the <LOCATION> Tulare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> area found high concentrations of unspecified trace elements at the Westfarmers Ponds, according to the summary, and `` preliminary evidence of adverse biological effects on shorebirds at the Westfarmers ponds was obtained.'' In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Freezout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> had some sites where concentrations of unspecified `` toxic elements in water, bottom sediment and biota were moderately to extremely high.'' At the Dry Lake unit of the Milk river irrigation project, concentrations of chromium, nickel, vanadium and zinc were double average background levels. Boron was found in coot livers at levels that could impair reproduction. At <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, nitrates above state standards were found in groundwater wells. At <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atascosa </LOCATION> and in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, DDT and other pesticide residues in fish were lower than they had been in the 1970s but still `` higher than the national baseline'' and `` of concern.''

 Voters delivered a split decision in parliamentary elections Tuesday, leaving unresolved the dispute over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s ban on nuclear weapons and its allegiance to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Complete results showed a small setback for the socialist opposition but no gain for Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s center-right minority coalition in the 179-member Folketing, or Parliament <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> had called the early election hoping to win a clear endorsement of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s `` full membership'' in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The Social Democrats, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s largest party, pushed through a resolution in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month designed to reinforce a 1957 peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on Danish territory. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had expressed opposition to the measure. Only the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, campaigning for lower taxes and less immigration, improved its standing. It won 16 seats, seven more than it had held before. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s Conservative party dropped three seats, holding 35, but they were picked up by other parties in the four-party coalition and the alliance held on to its 70-seat total. The two-party socialist partnership lost two seats to command 79. The Social Democrats will hold 55 seats and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 24. The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one. Two semi-independent territories, the <LOCATION> Faeroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, each elect two representativs. Final results showed 3,913,318 ballts were cast for a turnout of 85.8 percent. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> claimed the results would ease <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s crisis with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. But Social Democratic leader <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> said the election showed most voters backed the anti-nuclear measure that requires the government to notify visiting warships of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s 1957 ban against nuclear weapons during peacetime. <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> said he would continue the battle in the legislature to implement the resolution. The precise wording of the letter to be sent to ship captains remains to be drafted. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, in a television appearance, called on <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> to quietly negotiate `` a sensible solution'' to the issue that prompted the early election only eight months after the previous balloting. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON>, leader of the coalition's <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s government could continue `` There is still a non-socialist majority,'' he told a television interviewer. The other coalition members are the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>'s parties. Twelve parties contested the election, but only nine won seats. Clearly elated, <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Morgans </PERSON> <PERSON> Glistrup </PERSON> said his victory `` was good for the country.'' However, the party was not expected to be a factor in coalition bargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians. Every Danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and Danish politics usually are managed through backstage bargaining. Before the Social Democrat resolution passed last month, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> took the position that its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies abided by the rules established in 1957. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the measure threatened the solidarity of the Western military alliance and was against their own policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear arms. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the Danish action jeopardized its plans to send troops in times of crisis to reinforce <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, which controls the narrow access to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Unless the resolution is overturned by the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the government will have to carry it out, after the wording has been determined. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> has indicated he would follow the Norwegian model. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, also a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country with a peacetime nuclear ban, reminds allies that their ships are expected to abide by Norwegian law but does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The election came the day before Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to prepare for a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in two weeks. The nuclear issue `` could n't come at a worse time,'' said a diplomat from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A perception that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is wavering in its support of the Western alliance could strenghthen the Soviets' hand. During the campaign, most coalition parties focused on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issue. However, the opposition stressed economic concerns, on which it made some gains in the September election.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Acknowledges Confusion About His Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says there is `` confusion in the minds of many people,'' about his reforms but even those who yield to fear may not really oppose social change. The Soviet leader told editors and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideologists that conservatism is the biggest threat to `` perestroika,'' or rebuilding society, and doubters have questioned whether the nation is turning away from communism. The speech was delivered Saturday but not reported until late Tuesday. He did not make clear whether misunderstandings about his plans for a more democratic society and stronger economy reached into the 13-man party Politburo over which he presides. Party ideologist <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, is said to favor a more cautious approach to confronting economic and social problems than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but the extent of their differences is not clear. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told his audience: `` Some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these processes under way. `` Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked, and the panic _ and this is very serious _ has taken the form of asking: ` Is n't perestroika coming to mean the wrecking and rejection of the values of socialism, is n't it giving rise to alien phenomena, is n't it destabilizing society?''' The 57-year-old leader added, however, that not everyone who fears his reforms or has resisted them should be labeled `` an opponent of perestroika.'' `` We found veritable confusion in the minds of many people _ workers, intellectuals and administrators alike,'' he said. `` And let us be blunt, not only on the ground level, but also on the top.'' Some sources have said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies two months ago in supporting publication of a letter from a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher who said perestroika was destroying the nation built by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. A denunciation of the letter in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda was viewed by some as a warning to <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and conservatives that perestroika was above criticism. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said many people who were taught inefficient working habits simply do not know how to do their jobs any other way. `` It is shown that perestroika pinches someone and they start resisting, hampering the process of renewal of society,'' he said. But he appeared to forgive those tendencies when he added: `` We are all products of our time. We have conceived perestroika and we also manifest many of the things that inhibit it.'' He said the Politburo decided he personally should explain the reforms and the challenge they represent before the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that begins June 28. The 5,000 delegates will redefine the party's tasks and are expected to replace conservatives with more active supporters of perestroika. `` It is necessary to rid socialism of everything pseudosocialist, distorted and deformed in the period of the personality cult,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a reference to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ruled for 29 years until his death in 1953. The next few years will be difficult, he said, but he claimed progress in improving health care, education and agriculture. `` The three years since the April 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum have borne out that we have made the right choice,'' he declared, referring to the party meeting at which he unveiled his plans. He concluded by urging the delegates to the June conference to `` give our perestroika a new, second wind.''

<HEAD>Reports Torture and Violence Widespread in South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday accused South African security forces of widespread use of torture and violence and said it was part of the government's repressive strategy. A 160-page report said children are among the victims. It said there is evidence that `` an undemocratic government has extended the executive power of the state so as to undermine the rule of law and destroy basic human rights.'' The 1982 Internal Security Act adopted by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-minority government creates a series of criminal offenses of a political character `` in extremely wide and often vague terms,'' according to the report It said the security act, along with one-sided procedural rules, provides the state `` with the means of securing the conviction of virtually any political opponent.'' `` We have found that the government has allowed intimidation of suspects and accused persons, and interference with legal processes by the security forces ... to take place on a large scale and in a variety of ways.'' The report was written by four West European legal experts sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last year by the commission. They said, `` We stress particularly the widespread use of torture and violence, even against children, which is habitually denied by the government and thus goes unpunished, though plainly illegal even under South African law.'' Major abuses by the security forces also include the `` use of excessive force -LRB- including many killings -RRB- in crowd control operations,'' the encouragement of vigilante forces and arrests and intimidation of lawyers representing opponents of the government, the report said. It added that recent economic and moral pressure has `` forced a degree of relaxation in the formal structure of apartheid but the will of the ruling minority to retain popwer seems undiminished.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is faced with a dilemma, the authors said. `` A repressive strategy ... has become increasingly necessary to contain the huge disenfranchised majority, yet the acknowledgment of such a strategy can not be easily reconciled with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s pretensions to legitimacy within the Western liberal tradition. The report was compiled by Briton <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bindman </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Crettaz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and West German <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Witzsch </PERSON>. They said they were able to travel freely in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but many who agreed to be interviewed `` clearly did so at some personal risk.'' Contacts were maintained so that the report covered developments through February 1988, they said. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION> is a Geneva-based non-governmental organization and its members include up to 40 jurists from non-communist countries in various parts of the world. By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> appealed to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on Tuesday to help end the dispute over on-site inspection that is blocking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the medium-range missile treaty. `` The Soviets hold the key,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that although <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the pact has been temporarily `` put on the back burner,'' he could call it up for debate Friday if negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> resolve the issue. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he would need an iron-clad commitment from the Soviets in writing. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty before his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> begins May 29. However, White House officials acquiesced Monday in the bipartisan decision by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders to delay debate on the treaty due to the outstanding disputes. The chairman and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said, meanwhile, that the treaty can not be ratified if the Soviets continue to balk on on-site verification procedures. Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. and Vice Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, commented after delivering a report to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders apparently resolving an unrelated dispute over the inclusion in the treaty of such futuristic weapons as those employing laser rays or particle beam generators The treaty is silent on such weapons although administration negotiators contended futuristic weapons were included under the pact's ban on any medium-range weapon, no matter what it uses to destroy or damage a target. `` While there are many problems associated with monitoring futuristic weapons, ... the committee believes that on balance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in monitoring the treaty are better served by banning missiles using current or future weapons technologies to damage or destroy a target than by excluding them from the scope of the treaty,'' the panel's letter said. Otherwise, the committee contended, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence would be hard pressed to tell the difference between unbanned futuristic weapons and those armed with nuclear or conventional warheads which were banned. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the remaining roadblock remains the `` untenable'' position he said the Soviets have taken on on-site inspection. `` There has to be an absolute meeting of the minds on that before I can agree to support the treaty, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. He added that unless the Soviets back down and resolve the dispute, `` the treaty can not be ratified.'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> added: `` It's just a matter of whether the Soviets have the political will to say they are willing to live up to the commitments on on-site inspection. `` If they do n't have that will, then there is a very serious problem for the treaty,'' he said. `` Some vague, cosmetic language coming back from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> just wo n't do the trick.'' Earlier, some Democratic senators reportedly protested delay on the treaty _ which requires the elimination of all ground-launched missiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles _ expressing concern that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be unable to make further arms control progress at their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit if the accord is not ratified by then. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> declared: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would certainly look foolish to go into debate with these matters that need fixing hanging out there.'' `` I ca n't go ahead with it if there are multitudinous or even one gap through which the Soviets can cheat,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Speaking to reporters, he said, `` It could be resolved in a matter of hours, in a matter of days, or it might never be resolved.'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` We are asking the Soviets to put up or shut up on on-site inspection. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said on-site inspection represents the chief value of the treaty to the arms control process, because it can lead the way to effective verification of a far more sweeping agreement to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by as much as 50 percent The issue will be discussed when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> confers with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Wednesday and Thursday. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said it is important that it be satisfactorily resolved at that time. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> agreed, saying, `` The Soviets can resolve this fast. The thing that can expedite this is for the administration and the Soviets to sit down and close these loopholes.'' `` We do n't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' he said. `` This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> takes up the treaty.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` We will learn whether we indeed have a breakthrough in on-site inspection. If on-site inspection fails we will have a catastrophe.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration backs the delay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate. `` We feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action,'' he said. `` There is unanimity between the administration and the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership that these problems should be satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification.'' Assistant Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., emerging from a morning meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said they were confident that the problems can be surmounted `` I think that they will do their usual good job of splicing things back together again,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, referring to the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting.

 The number of confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease in the outbreak at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rose to 24 Tuesday, with seven victims seriously ill, public health officials said They reported there are 45 other suspected cases. The Westminster borough officials said new cases could develop over the next few days, but the risk of infection has been eliminated by the disinfection of air conditioning systems at the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters where the outbreak began in mid-April. Symptoms similar to pneumonia are produced by the disease, which can be caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning units. The disease is named after an outbreak at the American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1976. Doctors say it is fatal in about 15 percent of cases.

<HEAD>Bahamian Government Claims It Fights Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Bahamian government took out a full-page advertisement Tuesday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> newspapers in an attempt at `` setting the record straight'' about new allegations of corruption and lack of anti-drug efforts. The <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> decided to buy the ads as part of its response to charges of <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> drug corruption raised in various quarters, including the federal trial of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s reputed drug kingpin, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, government spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said. The ad in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and other newspapers was addressed to `` the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and signed by Bahamian Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adderly </PERSON>. It says the Commonwealth of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> has devoted much of its limited resources to fighting drugs and needs more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Specifically, the ad cites the need for `` more air search radar installations, more joint bases strategically located with helicopter strike force teams, more air reconnaissance patrols, more sea patrols and intensified joint undercover and conspiracy investigations.'' It says the archipelago of 700 islands and keys and 250,000 people spends 13 percent of its national budget on law enforcement, mostly fighting drugs produced in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and bound for users in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Published reports have said grand juries in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> are investigating Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. And reports in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have raised doubts about Bahamian drug-fighting efforts. `` He started thinking about this during these latest allegations at the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial,'' <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said. `` As you know, the position was not to respond while the testimony was being heard. Now that the testimony is over, the prime minister wanted to take an opportunity to make the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> position better known.'' During <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> had produced testimony that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> was receiving drug payoffs of up to $ 5 million. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> allegedly used <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> as a key transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adderly </PERSON>'s advertisement Tuesday called attention to a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> report in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> that criticized lack of cooperation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities during its probe into official drug corruption. That commission found evidence of drug corruption in some levels of the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government and law enforcement, but did not tie <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to drug payoffs. Last week, <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> issued a statement to the news media and at a rally flatly denying taking drug payoffs. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the allegations at <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial but would be surprised if any of the grand juries reportedly investigating his affairs indicted him. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> was re-elected last year after criticizing the corruption allegations, which first surfaced in a 1983 report. He has been in power since breaking the hold of the white-minority government in 1967.

<TEXT>
 The government has signed a peace agreement with a Sinhalese extremist group accused of killing at least 260 people during the past nine months, President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We have signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> with a hope to end bloodshed, to bring back peace in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said. He spoke during an award ceremony at a police target-shooting contest in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. National Security Minister <PERSON> Lalith </PERSON> <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON> told a news conference the accord calls for members of the front to lay down their arms by May 29 and cease all attacks immediately. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said that as part of the agreement he has lifted a five-year-old ban on political activities by the front and 20 affiliated student organizations and trade unions. He said he would soon release all front members who have been detained, except for those charged with murder or attempted murder. A front representative said 4,000 front members are imprisoned. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has said it was defending the interests of the island nation's Sinhalese majority against demands of the Tamil minority. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form 18 percent of the island's population of 16 million They claim the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese discriminate against them. Tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy or an independent homeland in predominantly Tamil northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> opposes an agreement signed in July by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to end the separatist campaign by Tamil guerrillas. It said the pact made too many concessions to the Tamils. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has at least 50,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast, to disarm Tamil rebels and enforce the July 29 accord <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population of 800 million includes 60 million Tamils. <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON>, who is a Sinhalese, said he and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> signed the peace agreement <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> did not appear at the Cabinet minister's news conference, but the front was represented by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Senanayake </PERSON>, a 23-year-old lawyer. <PERSON> Senanayake </PERSON> said in an interview that 4,000 front members were in prison and most would be released after the organization's guerrillas surrender their weapons to the government He said the guerrilas have not begun turning in their arms. Many of the victims of front guerrillas were government officials. Authorities have blamed the front for two attacks on Sri Lankan military installations and the assassinations of at least five candidates for provincial elections in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in recent weeks. The government said front guerrillas tried to assassinate <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> by exploding a bomb in Parliament last August. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> escaped injury, but the blast killed two people and injured several others, including <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON>.

 A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> man was convicted Tuesday of first-degree murder in five killings thought to be part of the `` trailside slayings'' in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> parks eight years ago.

<HEAD>Army Claims Victory Over Eritrean Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Marxist government said Tuesday its soldiers routed Eritrean rebels besieging a strategic town. It was the first official report of an army victory in the northern war. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said the battle occurred recently near <LOCATION> Keren </LOCATION>, 55 miles from <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been entrenched in hills around <LOCATION> Keren </LOCATION> since April and have tried several times to capture it. The front has been fighting for independence for the province for more than 25 years. The newspaper said the army `` made a significant breakthrough'' and was advancing after `` smashing'' the rebels. Its report indicated the army had begun the counterattack President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> promised March 31. At that time he acknowledged the war for the first time by saying soldiers were involved in a `` grim struggle'' with guerrillas in the north. Rebels suffered heavy casualties in the battle at <LOCATION> Keren </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said, but it gave no figures. It said the army captured rocket launchers, ammunition and guns. Ethiopian journalists visited the front and were briefed by field commanders who said army morale was `` unprecedently high,'' according to the newspaper report. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have reported low morale in the military following a dispute between <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION> and five top army commanders. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> purportedlu ordered at least one of the commandersm put to death during a visit to the war zone in March. Eritrean rebels and those in neighboring <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province have claimed many victories and captured several towns since launching an offensive in February. Neither government nor rebel claims can be confirmed and both sides often exaggerate. <PERSON> Tesfai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghermazien </PERSON>, an Eritrean rebel spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, claimed there had been no significant fighting around <LOCATION> Keren </LOCATION> since a big battle 10 days ago in which the rebels claimed to have killed or captured 860 soldiers. Apart from a few <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> and several church workers in both provinces, no Westerners remain in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> since the government expulsion of foreign relief workers April 6. The war and expulsions have endangered the lives of 3 million drought victims in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, the provinces most affected by a drought that threatens 7 million people in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

 Voters delivered a split decision in parliamentary elections Tuesday, leaving unresolved the dispute over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s ban on nuclear weapons and its allegiance to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Complete results showed a small setback for the socialist opposition but no gain for Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s center-right minority coalition in the 179-member Folketing, or Parliament <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> had called the early election hoping to win a clear endorsement of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s `` full membership'' in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The Social Democrats, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s largest party, pushed through a resolution in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month designed to reinforce a 1957 peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on Danish territory. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had expressed opposition to the measure. Only the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, campaigning for lower taxes and less immigration, improved its standing. It won 16 seats, seven more than it had held before. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s Conservative party dropped three seats, holding 35, but they were picked up by other parties in the four-party coalition and the alliance held on to its 70-seat total. The two-party socialist partnership lost two seats to command 79. The Social Democrats will hold 55 seats and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 24. The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one. Two semi-independent territories, the <LOCATION> Faeroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, each elect two representativs. Final results showed 3,913,318 ballts were cast for a turnout of 85.8 percent. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> claimed the results would ease <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s crisis with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. But Social Democratic leader <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> said the election showed most voters backed the anti-nuclear measure that requires the government to notify visiting warships of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s 1957 ban against nuclear weapons during peacetime. <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> said he would continue the battle in the legislature to implement the resolution. The precise wording of the letter to be sent to ship captains remains to be drafted. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, in a television appearance, called on <PERSON> Auken </PERSON> to quietly negotiate `` a sensible solution'' to the issue that prompted the early election only eight months after the previous balloting. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON>, leader of the coalition's <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s government could continue `` There is still a non-socialist majority,'' he told a television interviewer. The other coalition members are the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>'s parties. Twelve parties contested the election, but only nine won seats. Clearly elated, <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Morgans </PERSON> <PERSON> Glistrup </PERSON> said his victory `` was good for the country.'' However, the party was not expected to be a factor in coalition bargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians. Every Danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and Danish politics usually are managed through backstage bargaining. Before the Social Democrat resolution passed last month, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> took the position that its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies abided by the rules established in 1957. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the measure threatened the solidarity of the Western military alliance and was against their own policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear arms. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the Danish action jeopardized its plans to send troops in times of crisis to reinforce <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, which controls the narrow access to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Unless the resolution is overturned by the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the government will have to carry it out, after the wording has been determined. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> has indicated he would follow the Norwegian model. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, also a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country with a peacetime nuclear ban, reminds allies that their ships are expected to abide by Norwegian law but does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons. The election came the day before Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to prepare for a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in two weeks. The nuclear issue `` could n't come at a worse time,'' said a diplomat from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A perception that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is wavering in its support of the Western alliance could strenghthen the Soviets' hand. During the campaign, most coalition parties focused on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issue. However, the opposition stressed economic concerns, on which it made some gains in the September election.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends more for the defense of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> than do Western European nations, according to a congressional study released Tuesday as part of a long-running debate. The review was done by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which conlcuded that `` while allied contributions are sometimes substantial, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> devotes a larger share of its resources to the common defense than most of its allies.'' The study was the latest round in the debate over financing the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have argued that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations, particularly in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, need to do more for the alliance defense. But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have repeatedly answered that European countries do more for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> than Americans believe. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> study used a figure it defined as the gross domestic product, which is the share of economic resources devoted by a nation to its national security. By that standard, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> devoted 6.7 percent of its gross domestic product to defense in 1986. By comparison, the average for non-U.S. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries was 3.3 percent while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> spent about 1 percent. The review also compared per capita defense spending and concluded that in 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent $ 1,115 per person for defense, compared to $ 318 in non-U.S. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and $ 163 for the Japanese. `` This gap has narrowed somewhat since 1986 because of the decline in the value of the dollar, but remains substantial,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> concluded. The study used 1986 because the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said that was the last full year for which the data was available. European leaders have answered that the figures are n't accurate because some European countries draft soldiers, unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has an all-volunteer military. Those leaders have argued that if their recruits were n't drafted, but were paid market wages like in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, their defense budgets would thus be higher. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> answered that `` conscription does reduce the defense budgets of some allies, but it also results in a less experienced military that may not be as productive or as well trained as a volunteer military.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 325,000 military personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The administration has successfully opposed efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reduce that total unless <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies spend more.

 A death-row inmate who requested a lump of dirt for his final meal and insisted he wanted to be executed early Wednesday was given a reprieve Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in an appeal by his mother. The high court granted the stay for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> about six hours before the scheduled execution. No vote among the justices was released. <PERSON> Alexzene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> filed the appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, contending her son was mentally incompetent. Her attorneys also contended mitigating evidence was not allowed to be considered by jurors who sentenced <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to death. `` The order just says a stay was granted,'' Assistant Texas Attorney General <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapalac </PERSON> said. `` It's anybody's guess what they mean.'' `` I'm praising God right now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` That's all I can say, I just thank God.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was informed of the development as he waited in a holding cell next to the death chamber. `` When they told him about the stay ... he gritted his teeth and said something unintelligible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was later transferred back to his usual cell. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> would have been the 28th prisoner executed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ more than any other state _ and the 99th nationally since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, convicted of the 1983 robbery-slaying of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance office manager, has no attorney and has resisted attempts for legal help from capital punishment opponents. `` I do n't understand all this clinging to life,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` Life is a temporary situation. The spirit moves on. Death is like eating a prune in the morning. It's a natural function.'' On Tuesday, he requested `` Rhaeakunda dirt'' for his final meal _ a request <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> officials said would not be honored. `` It's not food, it's not sanitary,'' prison spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunnelee </PERSON> said. `` He'll be offered something off the regular prison menu.'' Officials could not immediately explain what was meant by the type of dirt. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M University soil experts said it was not an identifiable soil but believed it may be a dirt used in voodoo rituals. In such rituals, the dirt is eaten, school spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has said he believes in and has practiced voodoo. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former tarot-card dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> who was working as a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> taxi driver at the time of his arrest, was convicted for the 1983 shooting death of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>. Testimony showed he was tackled by witnesses while fleeing the shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was linked to the slaying. Witnesses said <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>, father of a 1-year-old son, complied with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s demands and filled a small trash can with cash, then was shot through the heart as he pleaded for his life. `` I do n't think justice could ever be done totally,'' said <PERSON> Rohus </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, who since has remarried and now lives in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` The only way for that is for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> to be alive and that's not going to happen. I think ... this will help my son when he grows up and is old enough to understand what's going on.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> repeatedly has said he is innocent, but says he does not want to spend his life on death row. `` It's not craziness, it's determination,'' he said. `` Other inmates say I'm crazy _ the strangest person they've run into _ but that's because they do n't understand my rationale. All my life I've been a loner I'm very good at doing that.'' If he desired, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> virtually was assured of an execution stay from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because the high court is considering a challenge to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death penalty law. `` I have no forgiveness, I'm not sentimental,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Let me get my execution over and leave me alone.''

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and 1,000 fellow workers left the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard Tuesday night with heads held high but with no settlement, declaring that their eight-day strike showed Poles they must `` fight to win.'' Bearing a cross and two Polish flags, they marched slowly from the yard, the 1980 birthplace of Solidarity, shortly after 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB-. Police stepped back silently and let them pass. Townspeople applauded from balconies and sidewalks as the procession walked three blocks to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a stronghold of Solidarity. As the workers approached, bells pealed and supporters rushed to embrace <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other strike leaders, offering them flowers and kisses. `` We thank you. We thank you!,'' the crowd chanted. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was a founder of Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first and only independent trade union movement. The federation was outlawed in 1982, but the workers declared Tuesday night, `` It's a new spring for Solidarity.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was not among those who launched this strike on May 2, but he vowed to be `` the last to leave.'' At the church, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> shrugged off questions, saying only, `` No freedom without Solidarity.'' After his wife <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON> embraced him, he teased her: `` Who's taking care of the house?'' The Walesas have eight children. Up to Tuesday night, police had kept a tight blockade around the sprawling shipyard, whose towering cranes dominate the skyline of this Baltic port city. `` We decided to make a sovereign decision to leave the shipyard without an agreement with the authorities,'' said a statement issued by the strikers. The workers decided Tuesday evening to end the sit-in strike for higher pay and union rights. The strike committee recommended the move in a 13-2 vote, strikers said. It was the last in a string of five strikes that began April 25, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law crackdown. `` We are convinced that we were right in the protest against relations in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, against treating us in a way that violates human dignity, against the arrogance of the authorities who are responsible for the crisis,'' the workers' statement said. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is deep in crisis and the authorities treat the country as their own property. We leave not in triumph but with raised heads. Our strike should make everybody aware that one has to fight to win.'' The statement concluded: `` It's a new spring for Solidarity.'' `` I think we accomplished something. We gained general agreement on the other side that we exist,'' said <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 44, and winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still works as an electrician at the 12,000-worker Lenin shipyard. Most of his 1,000 followers who remained on strike to the end were in their late teens and early 20s. Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, whose intervention paved the way for the first talks with management Saturday, expressed joy at the strikers' decision, saying: `` The strike ended at the initiative of the striking Polish workers. I express my hope that the authorities will respect their promises to guarantee their -LRB- workers' -RRB- personal and professional safety.'' He said he hoped recently imprisoned activists now would be released. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> briefly reported the men's departure from the yard State-run television announced the strike's end and showed police pulling down banners in the deserted yard. There was no immediate official statement. Nothing was said about when the shipyard would reopen. Strike committee chairman <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>, a 62-year-old engineer once imprisoned for leading a strike at the yard, said, `` We did n't lose anything. The Communists lost. ... I wanted to avoid the police taking them out. There were many wonderful young men there, and I could not allow them to be beaten.'' `` Solidarity lives, fights and will win,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s and a Solidarity adviser, as about 4,000 strikers and supporters gathered for a prayer service. Talks had broken off Monday after strikers rejected a management offer that would have made them abandon their quest to legalize Solidarity. After the alleged detention and beating of two striker couriers late Monday, strikers complained of increasing difficulty in getting food into the shipyard. Early Tuesday, government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said the absence of further strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> proved `` the strikes and protests have not won the support of the working class and society.'' Referring to the 1980-81 labor turmoil, he said workers decided `` not to enter the same river twice, a river in which we all caught a bad cold.'' The strikers had demanded monthly raises of at least $ 38 based on their current average of about $ 105; reinstatement of fired Solidarity activists, recognition of a Solidarity local at the yard, freedom for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers. They announced a new demand Tuesday: `` Preservation of the shipyard in its present status.'' It came after management said the yard's future was uncertain because of financial difficulties. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who led the hostoric August 1980 strike, initially distanced himself from this stoppage. But he was gradually drawn into it and the younger generation of workers _ the backbone of the strike _ treated him as unofficial leader. Police staged a raid Thursday to crush a strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steelworks in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Other strikes in the labor unrest were settled peacefully: at a heavy machinery plant in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, and by transit workers in the cities of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, Urban told his weekly news conference in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> the government was retreating from a proposal to ban all strikes.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man accused of an AIDS-related assault against his former fiancee insisted Tuesday he warned her he was carrying the AIDS virus before they had sex in his barracks room. In the second day of his court-martial, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> also said he wore a condom to protect <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> on the night of April 15, 1987. The case is the first of its kind in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, according to Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a spokesman at Treasure Island Naval Station. An Army private is charged in another AIDS-related assault case, which resumes Wednesday at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> is charged with having unprotected sex with <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> without telling her he had tested positive for the AIDS virus He is also charged with adultery, because <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> was separated but not divorced from her third husband at the time. If convicted, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 27, could be dishonorably discharged, stripped of rank and sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, 28, has tested negative three times for antibodies to the virus. The test tells if a person is carrying the virus, but scientists do n't know what percentage of those infected will eventually develop the deadly disease. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> reacted calmly when he told her he had tested positive. `` She did n't ask no questions. She just sat there,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. The Magnolia, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, native said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> watched television for a few minutes, then came over to him and sat in his lap. `` She said she'd take care of me and that everything would be all right,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. They undressed, he donned a condom and they had sex, he said. But a few days later, he said, she confronted him, denied he told her about the AIDS test and accused him of trying to kill her and her two children. `` I did n't know what to think. I was afraid. I knew she heard me. I know I said it,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. `` She said, ` I can burn you.''' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> then repeated that she loved him and wanted to take care of him and have his children. Then, he said, he proposed marriage because, `` I thought it would keep her from turning me in.'' He broke off the engagement a few weeks later, but she continued to pursue him, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> told the military judge and the seven-member jury. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>'s former housemate, <PERSON> Yolande </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMagdeleine </PERSON> testified she told <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> about <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s test results the night after <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> had been with the sailor. LaMagdeleine, who said she also had been <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s lover, said, `` She said she was going to kill him.'' But minutes earlier, <PERSON> LaMagdeleine </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> did not appear that upset about <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s test results. `` She acted not like I did when I found out. ... I was hysterical,'' <PERSON> LaMagdeleine </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> felt <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> `` owed her something'' after he broke off their brief engagement. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> then decided to file charges, <PERSON> LaMagdeleine </PERSON> said.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> met with his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lawyers Tuesday to discuss strategy in seeking dismissal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments that charge him with drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engaged lawyers <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollin </PERSON> after the indictments were handed up in February. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Monday night. After the meeting, <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> described <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as `` very encouraged'' by developments in the case and `` very confident'' about having weathered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to oust him. `` At the moment there are no plans for his retirement,'' <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military and police, the position from which he controls the civilian government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has applied several types of economic pressure since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dismissed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. According to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wants him out because of his opposition to what he calls efforts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Under the 1977 canal treaties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must relinquish control of the canal by midnight Dec. 31, 1999. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> won his first legal battle last month when Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooveler </PERSON> ruled he did not have to appear in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> court for hearings on his challenge of the indictments. <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said the lawyers spent `` quite a few hours'' with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Tuesday, `` told him the good news of our recent court victory and discussed our plan of action.'' He said he and his colleagues will appear in court in `` about a month'' to request dismissal of the indictments. Officials initially said the third lawyer, <PERSON> Kollin </PERSON>, was also in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for the meeting. They later said he was not.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> attacked birth control, abortion, divorce and the local Indian practice of concubinage Tuesday in a Mass celebrated 2 -LCB- miles above sea level in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country. Facing snow-capped Andean peaks soaring to 21,000 feet, the pontiff intoned from a flower-festooned altar in the native Aymara dialect: `` Do n't thieve, do n't slacken, do n't lie.'' The Mass took place in a muddy field near La Paz's international airport in the suburb of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> -LRB- The Heights -RRB-, 13,150 feet above sea level. Afterward, the pope flew to the mountain city of <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, 150 miles to the southeast, to rest for the night. Bolivian police, meanwhile, said two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men were arrested in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with explosives, a small plane and a flight plan that corresponded to part of the pope's schedule. They said they learned of the arrests through an <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> alert and decided to tighten security for the pope. It was not clear whether the men's plans were linked to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s trip In <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, a searing sun beat down on the huge crowd, estimated by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials at 300,000 but by journalists at 200,000. Throughout the Mass stretcher-bearing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers carried away people who had fainted from exposure. Many had been at the site since before dawn. Upon arrival at the field, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> greeted groups of the elderly, the blind and the crippled, including a 12-year-old polio victim named <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> who was wearing leg braces. Church officials said <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> worked with his father in the jungle crushing coca leaves, the first step in making cocaine. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s sermon stressed the importance of the family. He told parents `` not to flee from family obligations by putting your heart in other goals _ such as work, social or political problems _ or, worse yet, seeking refuge in excessive drinking or other degrading habits or in a feminine liberation that does not promote women, but rather subjugates them even more.'' `` Birth control is a falsification of human love,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. He called abortion `` a serious violation of moral order and of human rights.'' He urged Bolivians `` not to be seduced by easy recourse to divorce,'' which is legal in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country. Abortion is illegal but is believed to be commonly practiced. The pope criticized the centuries-old Aymara practice of `` sirvinacuy,'' or living together and having children without marrying. He said this was `` contrary to God's wishes and to natural law.'' Some Aymaras in the audience were heard to mutter, in their language, `` I do n't understand, Father.'' The local <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has largely accepted the practice, since most such couples remain together for life. In general the atmosphere was festive. Near the altar a group of <ORGANIZATION> Aymara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in bright red ponchos and gaily colored wool hats with earflaps played traditional music on windpipes and an accordian. The crowd cheered and sang songs composed in honor of the pontiff's visit. As he climbed the 25-foot-high altar, decorated with greenery and bouquets of red flowers, the pope halted twice to catch his breath in the thin air. It was the highest papal Mass ever said, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said. Earlier in the day, in an address to diplomats in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> criticized creditor banks for making big profits on loans to Third World countries mired in debt. `` The imbalance between the amount of this debt and the capacity to pay it, the difference between the sums loaned and the profits demanded by creditors, is causing very grave damage to many poor countries,'' he said. `` The abysmal differences between rich and poor countries are incompatible with divine designs of a just and equal sharing of the goods of creation,'' the pontiff said. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is $ 4.2 billion, about eight times the country's annual export earnings. It is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country, with a minimum wage of about $ 35 a month. In <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cespedes </PERSON> of the national police said <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> reported that two men had been arrested in an unspecified location in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They planned to fly to <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, he said. `` We do n't know if they were coming because of the pope or for drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Cespedes </PERSON> told a news conference. The pope arrived Monday night in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the second stop of a 13-day tour of four South American countries. He came from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and will leave on Saturday for <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>.

 Drug-related violence has surged in the inner city, with seven shootings in four days leaving two men dead, several others wounded and police pleading for more gun controls. The city also has been stunned by the recent arrest of a 12-year-old boy who allegedly helped sell cocaine. Police have made several arrests in the shootings, and believe some of the suspects may be linked to more than one of the incidents. `` Drugs and guns go hand-in-hand,'' said Police Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who directs the city's drug control unit. `` Drugs are a violent business and guns do n't help. There are just too many guns out there. People are going to have to change the gun laws.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said cocaine appears to be at the center of most of the shootings. He said crack, a potent derivative of cocaine, is still not as prevalent in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as in larger cities such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Things are just coming to a head,'' said <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who heads an anti-drug tip line in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, an economically depressed section of the city south of downtown. `` Drugs have been plaguing the inner city for a long time. But now it's just exploded and sad to say, it's just the beginning. People are very fearful about the warm weather.'' On Friday, when two men were seriously wounded by shotgun blasts in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, police arrested a 12-year-old boy in the nearby <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> neighborhood for allegedly working as a runner for a cocaine dealer. Police said the boy had a packet of cocaine in a pocket of his sweat pants and told officers, `` Lots of kids sell drugs.'' On Saturday night, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, 22, were shot to death while sitting in a parked car. Thirty minutes later, two other men were fired upon on a nearby street but escaped unharmed. `` Whether this is just a blip or a trend, it's hard to tell,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` But we know it has to do with handguns being a lot more plentiful, a lot easier to get.'' Two suspects arrested in the second Saturday night shooting, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 27, are also being investigated in connection with the double murder, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> pleaded innocent in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> to charges of armed assault with intent to murder. Each was being held Tuesday on $ 100,000 cash bail. Police had no suspects in the Monday afternoon shooting of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 19, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> was shot in the head in a <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> parking lot and was listed in critical but stable condition Tuesday at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital. Three more men were shot and wounded in separate incidents Monday evening in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> and nearby sections, and two 19-year-olds from <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> were charged in connection with one of the shootings, police said. The rash of violence occurred despite an almost yearlong effort by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police's `` power patrol,'' a 23-officer unit that monitors the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> area and concentrates on drug locations. In February 1985, a drug war broke out in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> between local people and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street gang that came to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to run heroin. There have been flare-ups among other gangs seeking to control the lucrative traffic, but officials said they do not believe the latest incidents were gang-related.

With 40 percent of the vote counted, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> had 23,926 votes or 50.7 percent and <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> had 23,248 votes or 49.3 percent. The popular <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> had only token opposition from disbarred lawyer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON> and was burying him 39,829 votes or 91.3 percent to 3,807 votes or 8.7 percent. In the presidential primaries, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who already has locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, faced no active opposition for 25 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the race for 25 Democratic delegates. Voters in <LOCATION> Daub </LOCATION>'s 2nd District also decided wide-open races in both parties.

Four Republicans were seeking their party's nomination.

 <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who had never before held public office, was appointed by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to fill the vacancy created by <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>'s death in March 1987. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, who had wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appointment himself, mounted an aggressive campaign against <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, prompting some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders to dub him a `` pit bull.'' Last week, <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> was a `` rubber stamp'' for Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said he refused to be drawn into negative campaigning, and Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said it was `` sad'' that <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> was resorting to `` desperate'' tactics. An <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll taken the week before the primary showed 41 percent of those polled preferred <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, while 40 percent backed <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> and the remainder were undecided. A <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> by a margin of 42 percent to 41 percent, with 17 percent undecided. The margin of error in the <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll was 4 percentage points, and 6.4 percentage points in the Journal polls. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, 44, was elected governor in 1982 in his first bid for elective office.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, who ushered in the state income tax and may have paid for it by losing his re-election bid in 1972, died Tuesday, a day after a massive heart attack and emergency bypass surgery. The 65-year-old Republican suffered irreparable damage to his heart, said officials at <LOCATION> Northwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> was taken after he was stricken at his downtown law office Monday. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> never regained consciousness after a second cardiac arrest and a quadruple bypass operation, the hospital said. His wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, and his daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, were at the hospital when he died. `` He always spoke his mind and had the strength of character to stand behind issues he believed in, such as the state's first income tax,'' Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> has been a superior and courageous public servant by any standard,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who served as <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>'s lieutenant governor `` Many thought we would not get along. But we had a remarkably good working relationship.'' <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, a Republican, was elected governor in 1968 and served until 1973, when he was succeeded by Democrat <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who had won with 51 percent of the vote. His narrow re-election loss to <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was attributed in part to the 1969 enactment of the state's first income tax, which <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> listed among his accomplishments. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor, made a fast rise in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics. In 1962 he defeated then-Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s candidate for sheriff and in 1966 was elected president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> ran for governor in 1968, overwhelming <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Altorfer </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary and then defeating Democratic incumbent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> with 51.2 percent of the vote in the general election. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>'s supporters have said his accomplishments included a major highway construction program and upgraded public health, penal and law-enforcement systems. Critics said the road program was riddled with politics. In recent years, <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> won praise for his handling of the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> bankruptcy, considered one of the most successful rail bankruptcy reorganizations. He was named trustee of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been under federal bankruptcy reorganization since April. Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> had been preparing to name <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the city's troubled public housing agency. `` Governments are constantly seeking him to solve insurmountable problems,'' <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrrell </PERSON> said Monday after hearing of <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>'s heart attack. `` When you got to the point where it seemed insurmountable, you called for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>.'' In 1958, he left corporate law to head a special <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crime-fighting unit in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he won a conviction of mob leader <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> on income tax-evasion charges. The conviction was reversed by a federal appeals court, which held that publicity might have biased the jurors. After the 1972 election, <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> joined the law firm of <LOCATION> Isham </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Beale </PERSON>, where he was working Monday. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> was chairman of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> presidential campaign in 1976 when <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> defeated <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the state's primary and then carried the state in the general election

On both counts, the Republican presidential candidate sounds alike: _ Although he once headed the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a presidential task force on drugs, he says he did n't know <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in alleged drug trafficking until this past February, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment was handed down in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ Even though a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, he says he had no hint that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms were being sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to free hostages, or that proceeds were funnelled illegally to the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> The vice president's continued denial of advance knowledge in both instances has hung over his campaign like a two-edged sword. Either he knew more than he's admitting, in which case he's not telling the truth; or the candidate who claims vast experience in foreign policy was kept in the dark on two matters of crucial international importance.

 Video mania is gripping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, brought on by a booming black market in VCRs and a desire of millions to see movies banned in state-controlled theaters. Clearly worried, the communist governments are going on the attack against them, but at the same time they are trying to corner some of the lucrative market. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, some Roman Catholic parishes organize video showings of religious and dissident films, and they draw large audiences. Any Hungarian can get a fill of gut-wrenching violence, group sex, anti-Soviet sentiment and other East bloc taboos. A newspaper in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> shocked readers recently with the account of a rapist who lured a victim to his home by offering to show her <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> in `` Rambo.'' `` Video is a powerful weapon,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo said recently. `` Video must no longer pass unnoticed,'' complained the Polish weekly <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION>. `` Its scale has become far too big. The video market has managed to escape any control by the state and perhaps this is the reason why it is flourishing.'' According to semiofficial estimates, at least 2 million video recorders have made their way into the six Soviet bloc countries, which have a total population of about 110 million. The scarcity of video recorders and the lure of the independent entertainment they offer means millions of East Europeans are hunting for VCRS. East Europeans who travel to the West often buy VCRs for themselves or to sell on the black market back home where they fetch many times their Western price. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, for example, an inexpensive Western VCR can cost the equivalent on the black market of $ 4,500 _ 15 times the average monthly salary. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, VCRs are available in special hard-currency stores, with prices ranging from $ 400 in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to $ 1,200 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It's a lot of money, but it's the best entertainment we've got and a kind of escape from the daily fare of state-owned culture,'' said a doctor in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where the state television is on the air just two hours a day on weekdays. Like other East Europeans with friends or relatives in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the doctor paid a hefty customs duty _ $ 700 _ to get a Japanese VCR sent by his sister in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The demand matches the high prices. In <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, the classified-ad pages of the government newspaper <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Libera are devoted almost exclusively to offers to buy or sell videos. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, public video showings have moved from X-rated films like `` <PERSON> Emmanuelle </PERSON>,'' `` Caligula'' and `` 120 Days of Sodom'' to regular shows in cultural centers in housing projects or villages that have no movie theaters. The Polish underground publishing house <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> has released at least 12 video cassettes, including the American movies `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'' and `` Sophie's Choice.'' It also has distributed banned Polish films, such as <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON>'s `` Przesluchania'' -LRB- The Interrogation -RRB-, which is about a woman imprisoned in the Stalinist era. Some Catholic parishes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have VCRs, which they use for public showings of religious and other films. A church in <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> had an Easter showing of `` Yentl,'' the Barbra Streisand movie about Jews in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The Polish underground publication Video Narcomania estimated last year that more than 70 percent of video cassettes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are pure escapism: pornography, science fiction, horror movies, other thrillers and comedies. That pattern holds across the bloc, where the most popular movies are Western box-office hits like `` Top Gun'' or `` Platoon.'' Recordings of American television series like `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Dynasty'' are also well-liked, as is soft porn and anti-communist films such as `` Rambo II'' and `` Rocky IV.'' Apparently trying to channel popular interest toward `` less noxious'' themes, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Rude Pravo assailed the popular taste in videos. `` Video programs on the black market are creations exploiting the lowest instincts of sexuality and inhuman violence,'' it said. `` VCR owners admire low quality movies full of blood until late at night in copies that are hard to watch.'' Throughout the bloc, people can watch up to four badly copied movies a night at private video parties. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, a Western, a porno movie and a cup of coffee costs $ 16, almost 20 times more than a ticket to a state movie theater. Official efforts seem unlikely to stop the video craze anytime soon, and communist governments have taken some steps to get in on the profits. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a joint venture has been established using components and know-how from the Dutch company <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> to produce 100,000 VCRs a year. Throughout Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, authorities have produced ideologically acceptable movies for the VCR, set up rental services and levied steep fees on imported material. Repression is also used. More than 100 semiofficial rental shops in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are now being liquidated under a 1987 law tightening control on the video market. In <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, some private Polish video-library owners face trial on charges of piracy, and one case has been reported of a VCR owner having his machine confiscated for screening porno.

I think they are far saner than we are, though they definitely are characters.'' <PERSON> Grife </PERSON> describes the book as `` humor for the intelligent reader.'' `` You have to have some knowledge about the world to understand what's funny about ` Actual Facts,''' he said. `` And if you do n't think they're cleverly written, try dropping or changing a word or two. <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> are n't very forthcoming when asked to explain the genesis of individual entries. `` Because of recent findings in a dig near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, archaeologists now believe <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> to have been an Apache,'' the book says. `` They both wandered the desert, did n't they?'' <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> said. `` If placed inside President <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> would have stuck out a total of 18 inches,'' the book says. `` Statistics taken to their ultimate extreme,'' notes <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The recurring themes in the book include musk oxen, snakes, presidents, potatoes and <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. `` With a good actual fact, there's a certain irritant value,'' <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> said, acknowledging people have divergent reactions. `` Some fall on the floor laughing, and some sit as if you're speaking Lithuanian.'' <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON>, 60, lists 40 some occupations on his resume, ranging from bartender to North Woods guide to lifeguard. He taught drama at <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>'s Friends University for 19 years before retiring in 1982 when declining enrollment, money and facility problems forced the elimination of his department. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 36, is a former student of <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON>'s who sometimes works as a free-lance artist. `` Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON>, however, Mr. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has never really gotten started at anything, and now seems pretty much to have given up. He has a degree in art,'' his `` Actual Facts'' biography says. The two live in an old farmhouse on a 16-acre plot, much of which was reclaimed from wheat fields. A huge barn is being remodeled into new living quarters. Outbuildings bulge with the fruits of frequent garage sale trips. About 60 chickens and five confident roosters roam the grounds. The <ORGANIZATION> Abrell-Thompson </ORGANIZATION> phone is listed under a fake American Indian name. During a recent interview, <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> slipped frequently into an Irish accent. He attributed the lapses to his `` mixed ancestry'' rather than the rum, apricot brandy and sangria he had been consuming to soothe a sore throat. The reclusive <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> spent much of the interview looking at newspaper advertisements for lawn mowers. <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> said a sampler of `` Actual Facts'' was shipped off to five publishers with a note: `` Is there a market for more of these?'' `` We got back one rejection slip. We got back another that said, ` We only deal through agents.' We have n't yet heard from the other two,'' <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> said. `` And <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> wrote us a letter that said: ` Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,''' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The two balk at the idea of a book promotion tour, book-signing parties or telephone interviews on radio talk shows. But <PERSON> Abrell </PERSON> uses his best stage voice and draws on his carnival days when talking up the tome. `` In this age of Trivial Pursuit, this is the archetypal, ultimate _ not penultimate _ compendium of knowledge,'' he said. `` I do n't think any household should be without one, particularly if there is a child in school, or if one of the parents has ever gone to school or if they've known anyone who can spell the word ` school.'''

 An `` <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> martini'' is a powerhouse concoction that includes neither gin nor vermouth. Its principal ingredients involve beer, a large funnel and a 2-foot length of plastic hose. Get the idea? If not, <PERSON> Ila </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a bemused local observer, will be happy to spell it out. `` They pour the beer into the funnel, stick the hose in their mouths and swallow the contents in a single gulp,'' she said, sitting at a beachfront bar in this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle town. `` It's a very popular drink on Saturday nights, when the fellows from southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> _ that's Lower <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ come down here to party. Welcome to the Redneck Riveria. As the lyrics of a popular local song explain: `` It ai n't no <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION>. It ai n't no Vegas night. It's cutoff jeans and bikini queens and a slice of Dixie delight.'' But in the decade since singer-song writer <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> `` Shine'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> first captured the special Southern-fried ambience along 130 miles of sugar-fine white sand and sparkling blue water stretching from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, much has changed. High-rise condominiums now draw hordes of tourists to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> beaches. Fancy restaurants and gleaming hotels rise amid the seedy bars, tacky motels, water slides, T-shirt shops and miniature golf courses. As a result, the term <ORGANIZATION> Redneck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riveria </ORGANIZATION>, one of endearment to <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and many other longtime residents, has become taboo among local politicians and <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> types. The <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> at one point considered outlawing use of the term inside city limits but was advised such a ban would be unconstitutional. `` We did have that redneck label several years ago but it really does n't fit us anymore,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official. `` We now have all the latest conveniences and most modern vacation accommodations.'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said the community now prefers to be called `` The American Rivieria.'' Whatever the tag, spring break and summer vacation revive the raucous nightlife in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, the polar hot spots of the <LOCATION> Redneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. `` Saturday night is really something to see, this time of year, when the pickup trucks and customized cars are backed up, bumper to bumper, along the beach highway,'' said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a special education teacher who moved to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> five years ago from <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` The good ol' boys sit in their trucks waving their Confederate flags out the windows and drinking <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> martinis. Then, after a big gulp, they let out a belch and a rebel yell.'' <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Binford </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> Euphoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lounge </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was holding forth, laughed as she picked up the conversation. `` The traffic gets so thick that they can jump out of their trucks and come in for a restroom stop and a beer. And when they go back outside, the truck they're riding in wo n't have moved more than 30 feet,'' said <PERSON> Binford </PERSON>, a transplanted Oregonian who said she used to keep a dictionary behind the bar to help her customers with the meaning of euphoria. `` It's those yells that I find funny,'' said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. `` We call them mating calls. The boys will see some girls and scream, ` YA-HOO' and the girls will answer back, ` EEH-HA.''' The nights become more serene as one heads west out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to beachside communities such as <LOCATION> Destin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION>. As the honky tonks grow fewer, the shore still sprouts high-rise condos, including a towering, 21-story affair in the village of <LOCATION> Seagrove </LOCATION>, halfway between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. Until recently, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> developers could build more or less where they chose. But lawsuits brought by environmental groups and a deflated real estate market have brought more stringent land-use codes and a slowdown in development. Despite the development, it's the area's natural charms, which include some of the whitest beaches and clearest water in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that make it so popular with rednecks and Northerners alike. Squadrons of pelicans, flying in tight formation, patrol the beach. Hordes of quick-stepping sandpipers skip along the waterline, and dolphins frolic a few feet offshore. On the riviera's western end, the state border is marked by the <ORGANIZATION> FloraBama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, a sprawling establishment of wood and brick. Located just a few feet inside the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> line, which allows it to open Sundays, the bar signals re-entry to redneck territory. `` If you're lookin' for the <LOCATION> Redneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, this is it,'' said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a bearded bartender at the FloraBama, where one famous good ol' boy, former pro football quarterback <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> `` The Snake'' <PERSON> Stabler </PERSON>, sometimes stops by to pass the time. <PERSON> Stabler </PERSON>, who lives at nearby <LOCATION> Ono </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, was n't in residence this day, but <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, a sun-burned construction worker, volunteered that `` The Snake'' has retained his redneck ways. `` Us Alabamians do n't mind admitting we're rednecks,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. `` But some Floridians, especially those folks over around <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, why it nearly kills them to admit it.'' Yet even <PERSON> Shine </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a marine biologist when he's not singing in honky tonks, acknowledges the area's nightlife has toned down since 1979, when Hurricane <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> wiped out most of the bars, beach cottages and fishing shacks along the shore and set the stage for the onslaught of condos. `` I know that the council and <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> would dearly like to promote this area as a retirement haven,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, `` but, frankly, I liked it better when there was nothing here but little ol' beach cottages and laid-back, barefoot bars.'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Jannings </PERSON>, who drove down to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> with a bunch of buddies from the Mobile area, said no matter what it's called, the beach is still the best party spot he knows of. `` We come down here every chance we get,'' said <PERSON> Jannings </PERSON>, who was drinking beer beside the beach in a black pickup truck. Just then, a couple of young, bikini-clad women drove past in a dune buggy, setting off a chorus of `` YA-HOOS'' from <PERSON> Jannings </PERSON> and his crew. `` EEH-HA,'' replied the women, and the pickup roared off down highway in hot pursuit, doing what comes naturally on the <LOCATION> Redneck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>.

 Violence and intimidation, traditional sources of power behind bars, have declined in a maximum-security prison here since officials began using a simple kind of leverage long known to parents of unruly children: threatening to turn off the TV. Drug use, too, has lessened among the 800 inmates at Wende Correctional Facility. `` It's become a very effective sanction,'' said prison director <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON>. `` All we have to do is threaten to take it away.'' Two years ago, the Wende inmates voted unanimously to give up their right to receive packages from the outside in exchange for the option to buy personal television sets for their cells. The program was originally designed to stop most drugs coming into the prison, but authorities quickly noticed another benefit. `` They know if they act up, they'll lose their TV privileges,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellen </PERSON>, deputy superintendent for security at <LOCATION> Wende </LOCATION>. `` Now they walk away from most fights and turn their backs on trouble.'' Most state and federal prisons along with local jails have television sets inmates can watch in groups during recreational periods. Some allow inmates to have personal televisions, but very few have programs like <PERSON> Wende </PERSON>'s, according to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based corrections consulting firm. In the beginning, <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON> said he was suspicious of the idea, thinking it would be viewed from the outside as `` coddling'' criminals. `` Let's face it, these people were sent here to be punished,'' he said. What convinced <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON> was the improvement in security at the prison. Instead of gathering in unmanagable groups at recreation time, inmates stay in their cells, which is the safest place for them and their guards, he said. `` I feel safer here than walking the streets in some parts of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON> said. The prison is about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> in the farming town of <LOCATION> Alden </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON> walks through the cell blocks, inmates nod and greet him with `` Hello, sir.'' `` This is unlike any other max joint,'' said an inmate who serves on the <ORGANIZATION> Inmate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` You can walk around without worrying about taking one in the back. `` I know guys who transferred here who give a massive sigh of relief,'' said the inmate, who asked not to be identified because he did n't want to `` advertise the fact'' that he was behind bars again. The program was the result of a meeting between state Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> and the members of the inmate committee. The inmates had suggested the idea, arguing that personal televisions would put an end to the sometimes violent arguments that arise when groups of inmates try to decide what program to watch. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> agreed, but set two requirements. First, he wanted the inmates to limit their right to receive packages. Packages sent to inmates from family and friends were a major source of contraband. Although packages are searched, officials said some drugs and weapons get through because of ingenious methods of concealment and because so many packages are sent, particularly at holidays. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>'s second requirement was that prisoners adopt the swap unanimously. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> put the same proposition to inmates in the state's 11 other maximum-security prisons, but only Wende approved. More than 400 inmates have paid $ 55 for 12-inch, black-and-white sets with headphones from the prison commissary. Inmates earn the money working in the prison. Top scale is about $ 1.50 per day. `` I'm not naive enough to think there's no drugs,'' <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON> said. `` But the inmates and staff are comfortable with each other. I do n't have inmates ripping each other off for drugs. I have a safer environment.'' An average 58 inmates per 1,000 at the other maximum-security prisons are found in possession of drugs, state figures show. The rate is roughly half that at Wende: 30 per 1,000. Last year, 23,000 inmates at 43 state prisons facilities underwent random urinalysis testing. Six percent tested positive statewide; only 2 percent tested positive at <LOCATION> Wende </LOCATION>. `` It's totally different from any other facility,'' said Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> McClellen </PERSON>, who formerly worked at the nearby <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> Correctional Facility, the site of the 1971 riot that killed 43 people. <PERSON> McClellen </PERSON> said the biggest complaint from the Wende inmates was getting too few channels. The inmates can generally get six channels from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> stations, via an antenna on the roof of the prison. However, reception is not clear in some parts of the building, and officials are exploring other options. <PERSON> Mantello </PERSON> said a cable hookup would be too expensive. `` We are not in the business of trying to please them,'' he said, `` but we must be doing something right if that's their biggest complaint.''

 The economists performed as expected when the stock market crashed in October, sagely warning that a consumer-led recession would follow. It did n't. Recognizing that their script might be wrong, the economists changed it a couple of months later. They delayed their projected recession to mid-1988, and some, daringly, even to late 1988. The consensus became even more widely split, however, when some continued to talk of imminent recession. They would not be put off, any more than the recession would be put off. But the old rationale would n't work anymore. Recognizing that the consumer had n't been frightened from the marketplace, the newly adopted reasoning was that an accumulation of inventories _ unsold goods _ would stagnate the economy and pitch it forward on its face. The inventory-led recession did n't happen either, but this did not faze the pessimists. They found a new approach: Instead of going directly into recession, they said, the economy would first overheat. That is, there would be a boom of sorts before the recession. To most people a boom is the opposite of a bust, which is a recession, but somehow the economic seers accomplished the turnabout without any public apology. `` They are a creative bunch,'' says one economist, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. He thinks they have done it again; he believes they are reacting to the past and present rather than reading the future. `` It is ironic,'' he said last week, `` that the pessimistic crowd sees a boom just as bloated inventories are starting to cool things off.'' He thinks many of his colleagues will be forced to flip-flop again. While you might marvel at this agility, its consequences can not be laughed off. Explaining why he wrote the book `` Economists At <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, Why the Experts Will Never Solve Your Problems,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lekachman </PERSON> explained that `` when respectable economists are wrong en masse, other people usually suffer the consequences.'' <PERSON> Lekachman </PERSON> wrote his book in the 1970s after watching his colleagues provide the White House with such poor advice that the consequences are felt to this day. Example: In early 1973 economists encouraged President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to dismantle a comparatively effective set of wage and price controls. As a group, they failed to see the price explosion that followed. `` At no point were the economists either prescient or helpful,'' wrote <PERSON> Lekachman </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, he summoned economists to a conference in September 1974. `` None of those assembled warned of the collapse of production and employment which began almost as soon as they left town.'' The advice caused <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to launch a program aimed at beating inflation instead of spurring the economy. Recession was the problem; the president was advised to fight its opposite, a boom. <PERSON> Lekachman </PERSON> asserted that conventional economics would continue to mislead politicians and the public until economists surrendered the delusion that they are pure scientists. Have they? Will they? Any answers are as debatable as economics itself. But some recent evidence suggests that if economics is a science it is very inexact. Example: An economist who views with curiousity and perhaps astonishment the herd mentality of colleagues to forecast an overly strong economy based on the latest monthly employment and jobless statistics. Says <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, Jr.: `` Employment is not a leading indicator. It is a coincident indicator. As such, it tell us only where we have been _ not where we're going.'' Example: A policy paper from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> stating that the latest consumer price statistics, on which hinge many of the latest forecasts of rising inflation, are being misread. It refers to the widespread assumption that inflation is worsening, based on a sharp increase during one month, March. What should be noted instead, the Chamber contends, is that in the January-March quarter the inflation rate fell. In the Chamber's view, the threat of inflation, on which policy is being based, is overstated Could it mean another flip-flop? It certainly could. End Adv PMs Wed May 11

 Heartache ungrieved has gnawed at <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitnik </LOCATION> for 36 years. Her brother is among the legion of the lost, one of 8,177 American soldiers unaccounted for in the Korean War. `` It's unfinished business,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Mitnik </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Her brother, Maj. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, vanished Friday, June 13, 1952, on a weather reconnaissance flight. `` I just want the truth. I want the end of the story,'' she said. `` If he were dead and we had the remains, he would be home. He would have his resting place. For now, the pain is always there.'' These days, few people dredge up the agony of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> because the memory of MIAs in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is fresher. Yet a comparison of casualties is heartbreakingly revealing: in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 54,246 Americans died in three years fighting an undeclared war involving 16 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> countries against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and more than 8,000 men were missing or taken prisoner; in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement spanned 16 years, 58,156 soldiers were killed and 2,204 remain unaccounted for. Since the end of hostilities, the remains of 179 soldiers have been returned from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>; none have been returned from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since 1954. A breakthrough in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is sought this year, the 35th anniversary of the armistice, because the South is host of the Summer Olympic Games, which will focus international attention on the peninsula and its people. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has demanded a role as co-host and threatens to otherwise keep its team away from the games, in which 13,000 athletes from 161 nations will compete where battles once raged. The war is technically still on, although a 1953 ceasefire stopped the fighting. The opposing sides meet each year through the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to enforce the armistice and discuss such issues as MIAs. Of the 8,177 MIAs in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the Pentagon still lists 389 as prisoners of war _ soldiers known to be in communist prison camps at the ceasefire but who were not repatriated. All were eventually presumed dead to settle insurance and death benefits. Bodies are supposed to be returned if they are found. Each year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked in vain for its MIAs and POWs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> always insisted it had no bodies _ until last year. On Nov. 25, the <PERSON> North </PERSON> said it had the bodies of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But international terrorism cruelly blocked their return. Two days after the <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION> announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 858 disappeared over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> with 115 people aboard. A North Korean woman confessed she'd planted a bomb on orders from a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> official to scare countries away from the Olympics. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on its list of countries that support terrorism and banned North Koreans from the country. The North retaliated by refusing to turn over the bodies. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> slammed the door in our face. They shot us down,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., who went to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in hopes of bringing the bodies home in January `` Until they see political advantage in turning over remains, they're not going to.'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, 30, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also rapped the government's overall handling of MIAs in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We left them there to rot,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. Government officials bristle at such criticism. The return of MIAs was discussed 77 times from 1955 to 1957 at the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, and is brought up every year at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. In 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> a fat file of maps and charts on 13 former POW camps, one former POW hospital known to have burial sites, 291 crash sites known to involve 301 people and seven <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> burial sites containing the remains of 288 allied servicemen. Last July, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered to send a multi-national search team into the North to find bodies. `` Every approach has either been rebuffed or accepted without response. It's been a one-way street,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's extremely frustrating, totally bewildering and totally inhumane to acknowledge you have them, acknowledge the responsibility to return them and then do nothing,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said of the refusal to turn over the bodies. On the possibility of living POWs, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said, `` We have no reason to believe there are Americans still alive and being held.'' Muddling the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> issue is how the countries deal with each other. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, one of the world's most closed societies, wants to deal directly with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rather than go through the MAC. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has n't had relations with the North since 1948, insists that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> first recognize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We have a nervous ally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' said a Korean expert with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on the condition of anonymity. `` The last thing they need is for us to get into bed with their mortal enemy. Disrupting a major alliance is too steep a price to pay simply to get some remains.'' But the missing men are more than `` some remains'' to Korean veterans. `` I could n't believe our government had forsaken all these people _ it's a national disgrace,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, a former combat <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and president of the Chosin Few, an organization of 3,200 Korean War veterans who fought in the epic battle of Chosin Reservoir. `` They truly are the forgotten people of a forgotten war,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who heads the group's efforts to reclaim bodies. `` They were shoved aside because we had other priorities. Nobody cared about the MIAs. It's a shame we have let it linger on.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has discussed MIAs with members of the Chosin Few nine times since 1985 through its mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the last time on Nov. 11, 1987, when caskets and transport for the two bodies were discussed. `` We were on the verge of a breakthrough,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said. The North talked to the veterans' group even though it lacks political relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are very much willing to solve the question on a humanitarian basis.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> is an unlikely Rambo. A tenacious, raw-boned <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, he has single-handedly crusaded for 37 years to free a brother he thinks is still captive in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` I will not stop until I bring him home or I find out what happened to him,'' said <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, 58. `` I never accepted he was dead. I have a will that wo n't be broken. If I was in his shoes, would n't I want my country to come get me? <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, an Army machine gunner, is one of 389 American soldiers still listed as POWs among the 8,177 missing in action in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> deny any are alive, but that has n't stopped his brother. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> vanished in battle Nov. 4, 1950, and was listed as an MIA that Nov. 29. He was presumed dead Feb. 26, 1954, but never accounted for. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and went to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1951 in a vain search for his younger brother. A buddy mailed his letters home from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> so his mother would n't worry about losing another son. Through the years, Mrs. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> clung to the hope the youngest of her seven children had not been killed, and she said on her deathbed in 1959: `` He's alive.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> vowed he'd find him. Rambo is a musclebound piece of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> hokum who storms into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to free American prisoners of war. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>' private war is more subdued but no less valorous. In his quixotic search, <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, a retired state employee on a disability pension since 1973, has mortgaged his house three times, taken one vacation in 31 years and filled his basement to the ceiling with papers, files, casette tapes and dog-eared documents. `` I ca n't let go of it,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. `` Everywhere I go, I'm reminded of it How can that many guys disappear in an area the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> won a federal court trial in 1984 to force the Army to reclassify his brother from MIA to POW. His brother is still presumed dead, however. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> produced three witnesses who said they had seen his brother in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s Camp 5 before they were freed in 1953. The change in status may seem bureaucratic, but <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> hailed it as a breakthrough. `` The Army now admits he's a POW. If he's a POW, then where is he? They have to go get him,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. What he has left of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> are black and white photos, service medals and childhood memories of making sure his kid brother made the 8:30 p.m. household curfew. Some of <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>' hope hinges on faint evidence and vague sightings. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Embom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, phoned <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> in 1979 to say he'd been a POW in Camp 5 <PERSON> Embom </PERSON> also said he was recaptured in 1956 while on patrol of the demilitarized zone. In his second captivity, <PERSON> Embom </PERSON> said he had seen <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> and 39 other Americans. But the government challenged <PERSON> Embom </PERSON>'s credibility, saying he was never a prisoner, either in the war or in 1956. Morning roll call reports show him present daily through his 11-month tour of duty in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, according to a 1980 memorandum from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>. `` All of the information supplied by <PERSON> Embom </PERSON> must be rejected as it has no basis in fact,'' according to the panel's staff memorandum. <PERSON> Serban </PERSON> <PERSON> Oprica </PERSON>, a Romanian businessman who now lives in <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> he saw 50 Americans working in a cabbage field in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1980, giving <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> hope his brother might still be one of them. `` If I die and nothing happens, at least I tried,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. `` This is all I ever focused on. I am a driven man.''

<HEAD>The Most Common Myths About College Tuition</HEAD>

 The average cost of attending private universities is up 81 percent, to $ 11,870 a year, from 1980. For public universities, the total of tuition, fees, room and board has increased 61 percent, to about $ 4,370. The cost at some selective private schools this fall will approach $ 20,000. Such numbers are painfully clear this spring to prospective freshmen and their parents who, fresh from the euphoria of mailed acceptances, now face the hard part: how to pay. Help exists for most families. A federal study this month found that 58 percent of full-time undergraduates receive financial aid from federal and state government or from colleges themselves. Aid per student averages $ 3,813. But college aid officials report widespread confusion about who is eligible for such aid. Familiar rules about tuition and how to pay it have given way to myths and misconceptions. Here are some of the most common, with comments to help set the record straight:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Myth 1: `` It does n't pay to save for college. If you do, the school just takes your savings. If you do n't, the college will rescue you with financial aid.'' `` That's just a screwy way to plan for the future,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouder </PERSON>, director of information of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brouder </PERSON> and other college officials say the myth shows a misunderstanding of the congressionally mandated formula colleges use to estimate how much aid a student can expect. Contrary to what many families believe, the formula weighs income more heavily than assets and savings in calculating a family's expected contribution. To illustrate: parents with two children, a $ 40,000 annual income and $ 20,000 in assets would ordinarily be expected to contribute $ 4,616 per year. If that family had $ 20,000 more in savings, their expected contribution would increase only slightly, to $ 4,864. But if their annual income went up the same $ 20,000, their expected contribution would more than double, to $ 10,384. In a different respect, however, the myth contains a germ of truth. Families who put aside assets in their childrens' names may gain tax advantages but miss out on grants and loans. This is because the aid formula entitles colleges to count 35 percent of such custodial accounts as part of the family's annual contribution. Combined with parental payments, a family's contribution could be too high to qualify for aid.

<TEXT>
 Myth 2: `` The higher the tuition, the better the school.'' Educators have lately dubbed this the `` Chivas Regal'' mentality. It holds that schools that charge the most educate the best, and those with lower tuitions must be inferior. As any guidance counselor knows, scores of schools among the more than 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions of higher learning charge relatively low tuitions but provide top educations. Alongside the many state universities that fill that description are such private schools as <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Millsaps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Loras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, the most expensive schools continue to attract the most applicants. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, for example, this year received 14,430 applications for 2,147 freshman places. Some colleges, Mt. <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> for example, openly admit they wo n't drop tuitions much below their competitors because they fear applicants will think their quality is slipping
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Myth 3: `` Federal student aid has plunged in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years.'' True, government aid is down. In 1987, aid from government and private sources totaled $ 20.5 billion, up 21 percent from 1980, but down 6 percent when adjusted for inflation. And new rules have made it harder to qualify, with candidates required to demonstrate financial need. But the biggest change in the financial aid picture occurred before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was elected. Starting in the mid-1970s, the proportion of all student aid in the form of loans grew from one-fifth to one-half. That has meant students and parents are assuming more college debts than ever.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Myth 4: `` I ca n't afford the most selective schools.'' Perhaps no one hears this more often than <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>, financial aid director of <ORGANIZATION> Bennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, where annual costs in September will reach $ 19,990, the nation's highest. More than half of <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION>'s students receive college grants, averaging $ 9,000 per student. Combined with work-study aid and government loans, <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said, the grants make that $ 20,000 bill closer to $ 9,000. That's small comfort to many middle-class students, for whom $ 9,000 is still a hefty, even prohibitive sum. But for poorer students, colleges who want diverse student bodies will pick up most of the tab. It is thus conceivable that a <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> could wind up no more expensive than a state college if a student can prove need. Furthermore, well-endowed colleges tend to use the financial aid formula as the starting point for calculating a family's need. Aid officers exercise professional discretion in judging what each family can afford.

 Myth 5: `` Why bother applying for financial aid? I probably do n't qualify.'' This encompasses a whole family of myths, each reflecting misunderstanding of how much help the poor, the middle class and the wealthy believe is available. Middle-class parents commonly complain, `` Poor kids always get taken care of.'' Not always. There's no question that the lower a family's income, the less it is expected to contribute According to the formula, a family of four with a $ 20,000 income would be expected to contribute $ 398 a year, while the figure for a family with a $ 40,000 income would be $ 4,616. Still, middle-class families enjoy many more options than most poor families. While the poor student with extraordinary athletic or academic ability might win a scholarship to a school with a hefty endowment, the one with more average talents finds precious few schools willing to absorb enough of the tuition to make attendance affordable. Conversely, aid officers meet many families these days who wrongly believe `` we're too rich to apply.'' `` We have a family of four with an income of $ 70,000 with two kids in college,'' said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, director of college aid at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, which will charge an estimated $ 19,000 for tuition, fees, room and board next fall. `` For their kid attending our school, the parental contribution will be $ 7,000,'' she said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Myth 6: `` You can work your way through school.'' `` I have a lot of parents who come to me, and say, ` I worked my way through and that is what my kid should do,''' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, director of student employment at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. At the low wages most students can expect between classes or during summers off, it's absurd for parents to imagine their children can contribute more than a fraction of college costs. Federally subsidized work programs make up just 3.7 percent of total college aid, down from a little over 5 percent in 1970-71. A student in the program who works the average 12 hours a week at minimum wage might earn 6 percent of an annual college bill. That does n't mean a job is a bad idea. A 1987 study released by the <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, examined 3,600 student records and found that those who worked outperformed those who did n't: Undergraduates who worked 10-20 hours a week got better grades than those who worked fewer than 10 hours or more than 20 hours.

Each has a little different goal in mind in the state that has been reliably Republican in 20 years of presidential elections, but may not be so this year. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s going to be looking toward June 7, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are going to be taking this time now to work toward November,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON>, a polltaker based in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> offers the last chance to score an upset over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an outcome that would strengthen <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s influence at the Democratic National Convention but likely would not be enough to derail the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's drive to the nomination The challenge for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is to avoid the pitfalls of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s contrary nature _ the state has rejected the eventual Democratic nominee in the last three primary elections _ and at the same time to lay the groundwork for the fall campaign in a state that may be crucial in putting together an electoral majority. And for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the job is to keep the Democrats from grabbing all the attention, to generate some excitement for himself and to attempt to close the gap in polls that show him trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 10 percentage points among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has promised to spend more than three full weeks campaigning for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 314 Democratic delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to spend 10 days to two weeks, spread over several weeks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides expect him to log a minimum of eight or nine days here, even though he has no real competition and the nomination in his pocket. It will mean more candidate attention than <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has been accustomed to seeing, given a primary date that falls too late to have a real role in deciding the nominee in most recent years, <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON> said. `` We've never had candidates spend as much time as these guys are going to spend here,'' said <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are going to campaign here as if it were October. `` What you will learn on June 7 is what message works for November,'' he said. Campaigning in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was doing his best to dispel the notion that the Democratic race is already decided. He asserted that despite the long lead in delegates that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enjoys, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> could turn the race around for him. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has the power to determine the next nominee of our party,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. A poll this month by <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KRON-TV </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 49 percent to 28 percent. <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON> said softness in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s support, as in other states, suggested his lead `` is premised more on inevitability than an affinity for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 21 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1984, when <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> finished ahead of eventual nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. His campaign has said it hopes to outspend <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> here, and while most observers expect him to better his showing of four years ago, his appeal to environmentalists, blacks, Hispanics, gays and young liberals suggests only limited potential _ unless <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' voters do not turn out The Spanish-speaking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also has appeal to Hispanics, as he demonstrated in winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Former Democratic national chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannatt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer, says he expects <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to score in the `` high 30s.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> polltaker <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> said, `` I have n't seen the kind of elements that would auger a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> victory.'' `` Right now I do n't see him doing much better than 10 or 12 points better than he did four years ago,'' Field said. `` Thirty or 35 percent in a three-way race looks fairly impressive, but in a two-way race, if the winner gets 60 or 65 percent, it does n't look so good.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, ever cautious, is careful not to look beyond <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But even so, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have begun focusing on each other in campaign rhetoric, and can be expected to do so before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s voters. `` We are working hard in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. `` As much as we can do there now is also an investment for the fall.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign press secretary <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47 electoral votes are `` extraordinarily important to the November outcome,'' and dismissed the suggestion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign schedule is mimicking the travels of the Democrats. `` We have to get out there and begin to build a base of support,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` ... We have to go where we have to go. If they're in the state, they're in the state. We ca n't ignore the West.'' The Republicans have carried <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in every presidential election since losing it in 1964, aided in most of those years by the presence of a Californian on the ticket. This year Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> is mentioned often as a running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although it would mean turning over the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor's office to the Democrats. The size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> makes it important in any electoral strategy. A candidate who carried <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would have the same electoral clout as an opponent who won a dozen smaller states. For the Democrats, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> may loom even more important. Although Democrats say there's no state-by-state electoral strategy in mind yet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s roots in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> give him an edge there, and the loss of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, two electoral giants, would make it extremely difficult for a Democrat to win the White House. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> does occupy a pivotal position in most general election scenarios,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' political director. `` The worst thing that could happen to us, obviously, is to have our momentum broken by a strong <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> showing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' he said. But, he added, it is also important to show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can be competitive in the state for the fall. `` I'd like to demonstrate the ability of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to attract broad-based support in an important, diverse state,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Yberra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Western coordinator who is running the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign, `` because <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has so much in common with the other regions of the country.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> ushers a guest from the cluttered kitchen of her suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home to the sunny living room filled with photographs of her children. A cat snuggling on the couch is quickly shooed away and Mrs. <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> begins to describe in even tones the physical and mental abuse inflicted by her husband, the former top chief of enforcement at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. She speaks about the violence during her 18-year marriage, the legal battles with her ex-husband <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>, the resiliency of her five sons and her own inner strength. She pauses to deal with a question from son <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, who has padded downstairs in bare feet to ask, `` Do elephants have tails?'' Five years ago, a messy kitchen, cat hairs in the living room and a sudden display of precociousness would have been verboten. In her book, `` Shattered Dreams,'' <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> described her husband's weekly white-glove inspections, in which he ran his fingers along tops of doors and windows, and how he liked to see the vacuum marks in the carpet all going the same way. As the result of her experience, <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> has become one of the nation's best-known victims of spouse abuse. She speaks out on the issue around the country and in return receiving thousands of letters filled with words of encouragement and personal tales of domestic violence. `` I have folders of letters that I ca n't respond to,'' she says. `` They pour their hearts out to me. There's enormous support. `` They say I've done just what I had to do. I had no other choice.'' At one time, the Fedders family gave the appearance of an ideal existence _ wealthy suburban home, exclusive country club membership, private schools, powerful <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> job. But a dirty secret festered inside the six-bedroom, beige brick house in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, Md.: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> beat his wife. `` We had been talking for a while. All I remember is that this conversation seemed to be going well. That we were really conversing, sharing ideas. We were not fighting, we were not being sarcastic or nasty. I swear we were just talking,'' <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> wrote in her book, referring to the first time her husband struck her in 1968. `` But I think it was the first time I disagreed with him and was sticking to my guns. I was arguing my point calmly, but I was holding to it. ... It was one good sock to the left side of my ear. Then I heard this ringing sound. I found out later that he had broken my eardrum.'' In court testimony during the February 1985 divorce trial, <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> described seven violent incidents that occurred during her marriage, including the time her husband struck her while she was four months pregnant with their first child. `` He loomed over me and hit me in the abdomen, three, maybe five times, hard. I bent over, trying to protect my tummy. They were powerful blows. It felt like taking a heavy fall. ... I tried to push him away, which only seemd to make him madder. He yelled that he did n't care if he killed me or the baby,'' she wrote in her book. Among those present in the courtroom during the divorce proceedings was a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, whose article of Feb. 25 on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>' problems touched off a furor that forced <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> to resign his <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post late the next day. In his resignation letter to then <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> said, `` On seven occasions during more than 18 years of marriage, marital disputes between us resulted in violence for which I feel and have expressed great remorse.'' `` These isolated events do not, however, justify the extreme characterizations made in the press,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> did not respond to several telephone calls seeking his comments on his former wife's charges. The ideal family was no more, but the legal battles continued. After <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> testified, he pleaded with the court to give him time to work out a reconciliation with his wife. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> suggested that the couple go out to dinner and try to talk things out. `` That was a devastating moment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent interview, recalling the 5-year-old incident. `` He thought it was the right thing for the kids-slash-me. <PERSON> John </PERSON> had promised never to do it again. The judge showed a total lack of understanding of domestic violence.'' In 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> domestics relations official, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>, reduced <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION>' alimony payments from $ 750 a month to $ 500. <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> also awarded <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> a 25 percent share of the proceeds from his wife's book, saying she shared the blame for his violent outbursts because she withheld emotional support during his depression. `` He obviously ruled very poorly. ... He does n't know what's going on,'' she said Judge <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> in February of this year reversed <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>'s action, ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> could not share in the profits from his wife's book, but his decision was based on the belief that no exact monetary value can be placed on a book <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> said it can not be considered a marital asset. The judge also reduced <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION>' alimony payments to $ 400 a month. <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> had asked the court to end the payments, saying the publicity had hurt his earning capacity by damaging his once successful legal career. `` This particular judge made the final ruling and I did as well as I could do,'' <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He did n't understand that <PERSON> John </PERSON> was manipulating the system, manipulating lives. `` There is n't a soul who does n't think <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> could n't be doing well _ in a small way <PERSON> John </PERSON> won. The judge bought <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s truth. For <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION>, the product of a strict Roman Catholic education and a family dominated by a strong father, her lone desire was the realization of an old-fashioned dream. `` All I ever wanted to be was a wife and mother,'' she wrote in her book. `` To marry a man who could give me children and a comfortable life, filled with love and little strife. ... So finding that man was very important.''

 While working at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> during her senior year of college, <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> met <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>, then a second-year law student at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He was the man she imagined _ tall -LRB- 6-foot-10 -RRB-, handsome, a Catholic who wanted a family. They married, moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> John </PERSON> succeeded in his law career, and had six boys, one of whom, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, died of spinal meningitis. During their marriage, according to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>'s book, the couple lived beyond their means, taking out loans to buy furniture and homes in wealthy neighborhoods. The physical abuse, which began in 1968, occasionally stopped when work went well for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>. There was one three-year break from violence. But when the demands of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> job and the family's financial problems got to <PERSON> John </PERSON>, the beatings resumed. There were also incidents of black moods, depression and long silences, <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> says. `` I ... used to hide in the closet. ... It was terrible, a human being huddled in a closet like a prisoner of war. I was n't hiding from him because he was yelling at me, or because he had threatened me. I'd usually hide when he was n't responding at all. Looking at me with hate or looking straight through me, saying nothing. I just could n't stand the emotional rejection anymore,'' she wrote. On a number of occasions, <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fedders </ORGANIZATION> took steps to end the marriage, finally contacting a lawyer in February 1983. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> moved out of the house on July 2. Asked why she had finally pushed herself to end the marriage after years of abuse, she talks about her own self-esteem, her ability to survive and support a family and the impact on her sons. `` The prime reason was the effect it was having on the children,'' she said. `` It took me close to a year. It was obvious what was being directed at the children. I might not deserve more but they deserve more.'' Since <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON> took that step, she has written a lengthy magazine article and collaborated on the book with <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>, a senior writer at Washingtonian magazine, to defray the legal costs. Her older boys are working to pay for their education. The <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> house is up for sale and the family plans to move to another <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb, <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, after a trip to <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> this summer. `` I still do n't know if we're finally going to make it,'' she said. `` But I'm really happy about things, content, hopeful, upbeat about the future.''

<HEAD>Michael Dukakis Draws In Audience With Kennedy Memories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of a recent speech by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his campaign for the 1988 Democratic nomination for president: Three decades ago, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> launched the first satellite into space. It was called Sputnik; and many said that it spelled the end of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s technological and economic leadership in the world. We could have accepted that judgment. We could have sat back and settled in and gone along as we were. Making excuses. Taking it easy. Living in the past. Instead, we elected a new president. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> awakened our sense of possibility. He rekindled our idealism. He gave us confidence. And he raised the stars and stripes so high they literally reached the moon. And when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> accepted the Democratic nomination in 1960, he said that `` today, our concern must be with the future. For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will not do.'' Today, as in 1960, we're in a battle for the economic future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And now, as then, the old ways simply will not do. This fall, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is going to be asking Americans to keep things as they are. But I say we have to change. And I say we must change. I say we must make change work for us, not against us. Because during the past seven years, I've seen too many people thrown out into the streets after decades on the job. I've listened to too many people who work hard from dawn to midnight every day and still ca n't pay their bills. I've talked to too many students who have the skills and the energy and the ambition to go to college but not the money. I've read too many stories about how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is supposed to be in decline; about how our children will have to settle for a second-rate economy and a second-class future. I do n't buy that. We Americans are n't about to write off a whole generation of young people. We're not about to accept an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where all we do is flip each other's hamburgers and take in each other's laundry for $ 3.35 an hour. We're not about to sit on the sidelines while our neighbors are thrown out of work and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s home towns are boarded up and left to die. As a New Englander, I've seen what happens when good, decent, hard-working people lose their jobs. I've seen what happens to their families and to their communities. I saw it in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haverhill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, when the textile mills and shoe factories my parents had worked in when they first came to this country pulled up stakes and headed south. I saw it when carpenters and bricklayers and ironworkers had to leave their homes and families and travel hundreds of miles to find construction work in other states. Over the past decade, in communities all over <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, we've seen the same kind of pain and agony and uncertainty that we lived through in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> during the'50s and'60s and early'70s. We see people struggling to make ends meet. We see communities struggling to rebuild in the face of changing technology and tough foreign competition. We see governors like <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, and mayors and community leaders throughout this region struggling to create a bright future for their citizens. That's why this election is so important.

 Because our citizens and communities and state and local leaders need a strong federal partner in the White House. We need a president who knows how to balance a budget and mop up Republican red ink _ and has done it. A president who knows now to create jobs and how to save jobs _ and has done it. A president who's been tested in the fires of debts and deficits and hard economic times. A president with the strength, the vision and the values to get this nation moving again. And beginning in January of 1989, we're going to build a future of hope and pride and opportunity for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and for this country. We're going to take charge of our economic future. And we're not going to stop until <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is No. 1. My friends, I'm a full employment Democrat and I'm proud of it. I'm not running for president to overthrow governments in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; I want to create jobs in middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And I know that if we Americans work together; if we invest together and build together; we can turn this country around and each and every one of us can be a part of it. Because if we're going to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> No. 1, the working men and women of this country must be full partners in the battle for our economic future. We need a decent minimum wage law. Sixty years ago, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> asked for a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour; the Republicans opposed it. Twenty-eight years ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked for a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour; the Republicans opposed it. Today, after the longest period in recent American history without an increase in the minimum wage, the Republicans are still opposed to it. They have n't changed. They wo n't change. And that's why we need a change in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. We need basic health insurance for every family in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> I'm proud to be the first governor in the history of this nation to sign legislation that will guarantee health insurance for every citizen in my state If we can do it in one state, we ought to be able to do it for the country. We're got to change the way we think about adult education and job training in this country. Education is n't just for the young; and job training is n't just for those on welfare or for the unemployed. We ca n't afford to treat our workers like replacement parts in some obsolete machine. Learning must be a lifelong process; and it must be a continual, ongoing part of every job in industrial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Here in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, at the Chrysler plant in <LOCATION> Perrysburg </LOCATION>, labor and management have sponsored college level training programs in computer skills and electronics and financial planning. And the Metal Forming and Coining plant at <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> is underwriting all the academic courses their employees wish to take. That's the kind of investment and teamwork we need to build a future where our workers are the catalysts _ not the victims _ of change. We're going to help our basic industries to rebuild and retool. Not by giving them massive tax breaks with no strings attached. We do n't need any more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Steels taking federal help and then going out and buying Marathon oil. Instead, we'll say to industries in trouble: `` We'll provide you with some protection for a limited period of time, if you agree, in advance, to use that time to invest and modernize and become more efficient.'' And when I say `` invest,'' I do n't just mean investments in new technology and equipment; I mean investments in your workers and in the quality of your workplace, as well. We need a strong plant closing law that will give our workers the notice, the training, and the benefits they need to find new jobs with good wages when plants shut down in this country. Earlier this week, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly to approve national plant closing legislation. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he will veto that bill. I urge him to sign it. I happen to be the governor of the only state in the country with a comprehensive plant closing law. We passed it with the support of labor and business. And it's working. Because we've been able to save thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses. And I hope the president will take the time to think about the 3 million American workers who lose their jobs in this country every year through plant shutdowns. In at least half those cases, those plants shut down with little or no notice to those most affected _ their own employees. These people are our neighbors. They deserve better from their employers; they deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The principle behind plant closing legislation is simple. If we want to save jobs; we've got to know, in advance, that a factory or a plant is in trouble. We've got to give governors and mayors and community leaders a chance to go to work to save those jobs; to keep that plant open; to cushion the blow for the community where that plant is located. The national plant closing bill approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will help us to save jobs. It will help our workers to get the skills to find new jobs. It will help our communities by keeping plants open. It will help our taxpayers by reducing the cost of unemployment insurance and welfare. It should be the law of the land. Finally, if we're serious about winning the battle for our economic future, we've got to get control of the merger and acquisition binge that's gobbling up our capital, destroying competition, and creating billions in profits for a few, without creating a single new job for American workers. Today, too many of our best educated and most talented citizens are using their skills not in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s war against foreign competition; but in a civil war for paper profits _ a war that pits region against region, business against business, and management against labor; a war that weakens our economy at home and our competitiveness abroad; a war whose primary victims are the working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. During the past five years, more than 12,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations have changed hands. Today, according to Business Week, the corporate takeover wave is `` skyscraper high.'' We've had 15 takeover bids of a billion dollars or more since New Year's Day _ less than four months ago. And what have we got to show for it? Massive corporate debt. Lower quality products. Workers thrown into the streets. A less competitive <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And the profits they're making are unbelievable. We've seen corporate raiders make $ 140 million trying to take over <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, while 35,000 workers were laid off. We've seen raiders make $ 160 million in a deal that forced <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> so far into debt it had to shut down plants in high unemployment areas in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. And for the people of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> _ the community here in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> which depends so heavily only the long-term success of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> _ there now is, in the words of its congressman and former Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, `` a lingering sense of insecurity not only for the future of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, but for the future of our community.'' Altogether, 500,000 workers have lost their jobs as a result of the merger mania in recent years; and thousands more have had pension plans terminated so that companies could skim the surplus off those pension funds. And why are we putting up with this? Because we have a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> that wo n't stand up for the American workers. Because we've got an attorney general who could n't tell the difference between antitrust and antifreeze; and a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that seems to have forgotten that its job is to promote and encourage competition in the American marketplace. Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams are n't a model for the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To build the future we want, we're going to have to do what my parents and millions of immigrants did when they came to this country. Work hard. Save. Invest. Produce, not just consume. Make sure that the label `` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' _ the union label _ is a symbol of quality and durability and value all over the world. My friends, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is n't just a place; it's not just another piece of land; or just another country. It's the noblest experiment ever undertaken on this planet. It's a symbol of what we human beings can do _ when we work together; when we respect each other; when we understand that we are one people. One nation. One community. Because there are no shortcuts to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't hide; we compete. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't waste; we invest. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't leave some of its citizens behind; we work for everyone. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't yearn for the past; we prepare to take on the future. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is n't behind us; the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a nation where the son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants can seek _ and win _ the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thank you very much.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of a basic stump speech by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: I come to you from a tradition of challenge, of struggle and of success. Sunday, March 6, marked the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. There, 23 years ago, marchers led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and young students tried to cross <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettus </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> demonstrating for the right to vote. They were beaten back, bloodied by dogs and clubs. But they did not bow. Twenty years ago, a generation of young Americans stood up to end racial violence under the law. When <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> refused to go to the back of the bus in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, a divinity student _ <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> _ came to her rescue. When Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> was arrested, other students and ministers came to his rescue. In <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, students sat down at lunch counters. They ordered hamburgers but were given handcuffs. They chose dignity over docility. And young Americans stood with them. Twenty years ago, the moral issue of that day was racial violence, sanctioned by the law. But when young <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stood tall, the country responded. Today we have the right to vote. We have the right to use libraries, hotels, public accommodations. We have the right of equal access to education. Faced with the challenge of racial violence, we have achieved civil rights and moved toward racial justice. Today, as I look out over you _ black, brown, red, yellow and white, male and female _ I see the fruits of our labors, the victory of young <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s struggle. And I rejoice _ for we have helped to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better. In this day we face a new challenge _ to end economic violence. It is the unfinished business of the country, of two generations. And it is more pressing than ever. It is the unfinished agenda of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and the generation that sacrificed so much to triumph in the Second World War. That war was fought to secure fundamental human rights: freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear and want. We have made great strides to achieve political and religious freedom in this country. But the promise of economic rights and freedom from fear has remained unfulfilled. Twenty years ago, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> moved the country to help fulfill the promise of civil and political rights, marching to end racial violence. But Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> did not stop in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>. He left us in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where he stood with striking garbage workers. The garbage workers had their civil rights. They had the right to vote. But they worked without a liveable wage. They had no right to strike. They worked, but they worked in poverty. Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> stood with them when he was taken from us. Twenty years later, this unfinished business is the central moral challenge of the day. Plant gates that close upon workers without notice. Economic violence. Shipyards where goods made by repressed labor abroad undercut organized labor at home. Economic violence. Schoolyards where students with good minds ca n't get a scholarship and ca n't make a loan Economic violence. Hospitals where people lie without care in admitting offices because they do n't have a yellow or green card to go upstairs to a bed that's empty waiting for the insured to get sick. Economic violence. A little known fact in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today is that most poor people are not black or brown. Most poor people are white. Most poor people are young. Most poor people are female. And most able-bodied poor people are not on welfare _ they work. But when they finish working they do not have a sufficient wage to lift their children from poverty. The poor serve food to others every day. They work hard every day. They raise other people's children, sometimes neglecting their own. They work hard every day. They take care of the sick, in hospitals, changing their clothes and their bed pans. They work hard every day. And when they get sick they ca n't afford to stay in the hospital that they work in. They work hard every day. We are a better nation than that. We need a comprehensive national health care program for all Americans.

<HEAD>WASHN: all Americans.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 To address this challenge, we must analyze the situation correctly. We have lost 650,000 family farms in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> over the past seven years. Workers throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ auto workers, steel workers, machinists, electricians, computer programmers _ have been displaced from jobs. Farmers who fed the nation and fed the world know how to farm. Workers who have built the country know how to work. The problem is not the farmer or the worker. They deserve our respect. The problem is that the structure does n't work. It's not a question of black people taking jobs from white people; of women taking jobs from men. When a plant closes without notice, when a farm is sold at auction, they pull out the plug. The lights go out. You ca n't use color or sex for a crutch in the dark. We all look remarkably similar in the dark. Now we hear a lot about foreign workers _ Taiwanese, <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> _ taking our jobs. Many seek to blame foreigners for the loss of jobs. But foreign workers without the right to organize and barely the right to vote are not taking our jobs from us. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> multinational corporations are taking our jobs to them. For example, in 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported 7 million bicycles from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. There are no Taiwanese bicycle companies, only Schwinn and other companies. As the vice president of Schwinn stated, `` The competition from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is us.'' In 1986, the biggest exporter from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was n't Taiwanese. It was <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which advertises buy in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on television. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> took jobs to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> not looking for better labor, but cheaper labor. The American worker can compete, but first we need to level the playing field. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> is one of the top 10 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contractors. From 1981-84, it made $ 10 billion in profits. It paid nothing in taxes. In fact, it received a $ 100 million tax rebate. That's not fair. It's not a question of white against black, or Asians against Americans, it's a question of barracudas and small fish. Today, some 36,000 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> are threatened with the loss of their jobs, unless they take 25-60 percent cuts in pay and benefits. Why? Because <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a corporate barracuda, bought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and now is prepared to dismember the company in order to crush the union. Who pays? Workers pay _ in wage cuts and lack of protection. Passengers pay. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s airline conglomerate in recent months has the worst safety and service record in the industry. Communities pay. If Eastern workers are displaced, the economy of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will be depressed. Only the barracuda benefits. We must change the incentives and stop the merger of corporations, the purging of workers and the submerging of our economy. We need to level the playing field. We need to change the incentives to get corporations to reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to retrain our workers, to reindustrialize our nation, to promote research and development. We must join with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to lower interest rates and stimulate global growth. We must relieve the debt which is crushing the Third World. If their debt goes down, our trade goes up. If our trade goes up, our deficit goes down and our economy gets moving again. We need to make the denial of basic labor rights an unfair trade practice, so that workers abroad have the opportunity to gain fair wages and working conditions. As their wages go up, they can afford to buy our goods, and our trade goes up. We all rise together. Either we will work to raise the living conditions of workers in the Third World, or we will lower our conditions toward theirs. We need to challenge the very premise of Reaganomics. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was right when he said this was voodoo economics. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the only person who ca n't quote himself. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assumed that the poor had too much money, the rich had too little and that our insecurity came from a weak military. So he engaged in a reverse <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> _ he took from the poor and gave to the rich. From 1977 to 1988, the bottom 10 percent ended up paying 20 percent more in taxes and the top 1 percent are paying 20 percent less in taxes. Essentially he gave the rich and the powerful a $ 400 billion tax cut. The assumption was that they would invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and get our economy going again. Instead, they had a party. Merging corporations, speculating on junk bonds, playing in the stock market. Then on Oct. 19, the stock market crashed. Now they want you _ who were n't even invited to the party _ to pay for the party. That is not fair. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assumed that we felt insecure because our military was weak, so he doubled the military budget in peacetime. But he was wrong. Our military is strong _ the strongest in the world _ it's our policy that's weak. Strong military, weak policy. We are militarily superior in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but our policy is weak. We are militarily superior in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but our policy is weak. We have 26,000 nuclear warheads, 13,000 pointing at the Russians. Even President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has come to understand that more nuclear weapons simply make us less secure.

<HEAD>WASHN: less secure.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We must begin to make sense. Last year there was a 19-day strike of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> school teachers. We just could n't find the money to pay those teachers. Well, at Christmas I took my children to visit the prisoners at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. I did some research. Full year scholarship in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public schools: $ 3,500. Full year scholarship at <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>: $ 1,500. Full year scholarship at Cook County Jail: $ 12,000. Schools at their worst are better than jails at their best. I choose to invest in prenatal care, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> and child care on the front side of life rather than welfare and jailcare on the back side. Let's make sense. Think about our security. The No. 1 threat on our streets today is not <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. We are not threatened by 3 million Sandinistas. And 15,000 Contras could not save us from them if we were. The No. 1 threat to our security today is drugs _ cocaine, crack, heroin and PCP. Drugs are now a $ 150 billion tax free industry. Overrunning our borders. Corrupting entire governments. Leading cause of crime. A primary cause of AIDS. Destroying our children, undermining workers and productivity, overwhelming police forces, threatening to bankrupt city budgets. In a $ 150 billion industry, more than children are involved. Bankers are involved, laundering that money. It is a factor in foreign exchange. Governments are involved, protecting the trade. It is an aspect of our foreign policy, either the most inept or the most corrupt aspect of our foreign policy. Drugs are no longer a nuisance. Today, drugs are the No. 1 threat to our national security, to our children, to our communities. I went to the Coast Guard in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In 1986, they interdicted 10,300 pounds of cocaine. In 1987, 13,900 pounds. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget was cut by $ 105 million. They busted the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and gave drug traffickers a green light. When I raised a storm about it, the White House called. We did n't cut the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did. Well, he fought for <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> aid, why not fight for <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aid? If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget, he could have just said no. Today we have troops in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and that is OK. But security begins at our borders. It does not make sense to have 325,000 troops stationed in a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at peace, while we are overwhelmed at our borders by a threat to our children. Let's make sense. Everyone says, yes we are for economic justice. But we have this deficit. We're for educating our children. But we have this deficit. We're for comprehensive health care. But what about the deficit? <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s basic teaching says we ca n't afford economic justice. I say we ca n't afford not to have economic justice. Poor people did not cause the deficit. Seniors did not cause the deficit. When you drive into a blind alley, you have to get out the same way you got in. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cut the taxes of the rich and the corporations and doubled the military budget in peacetime. We can afford economic justice, but the rich must pay their fair share of taxes. If the top 600,000 earners who make $ 192,000 plus, pay at the 38 percent rate rather than the 28 percent rate, that's $ 20 billion If the corporations pay at 1980 levels, that's another $ 16 billion; if they pay at their average level of the 1970s, that's over $ 30 billion. We can afford economic justice but we must make choices. Today we spend some $ 150 billion a year defending <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 43 years after the war. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have recovered. Yet their share of total allied spending has dropped from 50 percent seven years ago to 30 percent today. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the countries have twice the GNP and 1 -LCB- times the population of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. They can better share the burden of their own defense. We can cut the military without cutting our defense. We have no need for a Midgetman missile _ $ 45 billion for a weapon we ca n't use and do n't need. We have 14 aircraft carrier task forces; the Soviets have none. We do not need two more at a cost of another $ 34 billion. Star Wars will only make us more insecure. We should stop the crash `` deployment'' of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, saving $ 200 billion to $ 1 trillion over the next decade. But we must also look beyond the effort to make sense. We must look beyond the wars in the world, to the possibility of peace and prosperity. We can end the war in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that is not our future. Our future is with 400 million Latin Americans _ friends, neighbors, customers who need medicine, tractors, steel, infrastructure, telecommunications, and grain. Our future is not with apartheid; we can end apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Our future is with 560 million Africans, friends, allies, customers. We must relieve <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of the burden of occupation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. We should not choose sides in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but peace. And beyond the war, beyond occupation, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> can trade, and grow and turn the desert into flowers.

<HEAD>Bush Says Issue is Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of a recent typical campaign speech by Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: As I look at it, regardless of the choice on the Democratic side, the philosophical choice for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is going to be as clearly defined as the choice in 1980 or again the choice in 1984. And the central issue in the general election is going to be: what will <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future be in the 1990s and as we enter the 21st century? What's our role to be as leader of the free world _ the only power capable of advancing real peace and freedom. And what's our place going to be in driving the economic engine of domestic and global prosperity I still do n't sense an isolationistic tendency on the part of the people. I do n't believe the American people are isolationists. I believe that our people understand and accept the international responsibilties that are thrust upon us. You ask an American, hey, do you think somebody ought to pay more for defense in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> or carrying the burden in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>? Obviously, they'd say yes. But I do n't equate that with fundamental isolationism. I believe the American people will accept the burdens of maintaining a strong national defense _ not just because we want a military second to none. But because a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to lead us to a more peaceful and a less dangerous world. The Democrats urge dramatic and dangerous cuts in our military preparedness for the future. I believe that unilateral cuts to eliminate or reduce our development and deployment of the MX and Midgetman missiles, two naval carrier groups, meaningful research on SDI, is simplistic, naive and very short-sighted. If we've learned anything from dealing with the Soviets, we've learned that dealing from strength results in meaningful arms control We first learned that lesson nearly 20 years ago when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized funding for the anti-ballistic missile system. And soon after that, the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration was able to negotiate the ABM treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Had we not been willing to do that we never would have had a treaty. In the early 1980s, an influential element within the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to enter into a nuclear freeze agreement. You remember that. Lock it in right now. Leave it the way it is. At that time, the Soviets had 1,000 intermediate nuclear force weapons deployed against <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, warheads. And we had zero. Instead of a freeze, a freeze that would have locked in that asymmetry, that significant imbalance in favor of the Soviets, we proposed the moral option, the zero option it was called. Zero zero. The option called for removal of all Soviet INF missiles and in return we would n't deploy any. And we were castigated for not knowing how to deal with the Soviets, and how would they ever agree to anything of this nature? But because we had the strength and commitment to deploy, we achieved an INF treaty. The zero option ultimately became a reality. The INF missles on both sides will be eliminated and for the first time in history we have an arms control agreement that eliminates an entire generation of nuclear weapons. It's done in a verifiable way, with relevance in terms of our desire to get the conventional forces in balance, have relevance in terms of banning chemical and biological weapons. If we had followed the advice of the Democratic left, whose policies are now being embraced as I look at it by both the men who seem to be in the forefront of their run for the presidency, we would n't have a treaty. But we would have a Soviet imbalance, an asymmetry, 1,000 Soviet weapons and zero <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- weapons -RRB-. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people overwhelmingly support this treaty. And properly so. And I hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will stop all this foot-dragging _ it's taking far too long in my opinion _ and will go forward and ratify that treaty before the president goes to the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the end of May.

 In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Soviets are pulling out. And they're pulling out because we did support, along with some others, the freedom fighters there. And our steadfast support has worked. It has n't always been easy. But it has worked in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. And our sporadic and less-than-dependable support has failed those who are fighting a totalitarianism of a similar nature right here in our own hemisphere in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. On the domestic side, the Democrats are calling up promise after promise for new or expanded social programs. I do n't know what it would cost, they have n't told us. But I do know that the single most important domestic economic problem _ fiscal problem _ facing our country is the federal budget deficit. And the federal government ca n't do it all. I do n't want it said you're not compasionate, you do n't care about the homeless, the elderly, the uneducated. I care desperately. But I want to have a strong economy. Public partnerships can work better: we're sitting on the cutting edge of some of these problems. I believe in the federalist system. And the foremost responsibility I see of the president now and of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that appropriates every dime and tells us how to spend every dime is trying to do better on this federal budget deficit. Keeping our economy strong, maintaining a strong national defense and maintaining a sensible foreign policy are essential if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to remain the leader of the free world. Today, the world's changing, changing rapidly. Communications are instant, population is growing, Third World nations are aggressively competing for a market share in the world's economy. The challenge to us is: how do we compete successfully in this dog-eat-dog global economy? During the past decade, the battle we've been having with our foreign competitors has been having a profound effect on American business and industry. I believe that quality is the answer to the challenge we face from our foreign competitors. Our economic system is built on competition. And it works because the truest way to succeed is to produce the best value for the customer. Quality is important, not just to compete in the export market. It's important to compete right here at home. I believe American industry can compete with any nation on earth. We see new attention to cost control, to lean management, knowing how to sell in the other guy's market. I was wrong. I thought that before now the trade deficit would be dramatically reduced from the devaluation of the currency, the dollar vs. the yen particularly. It's taken longer than I thought. The Japanese are absorbing profits to protect market share. They ca n't do that forever. I'm optimistic about the continued growth in our exports and a reducing of this imbalance Exports are up dramatically. Real exports last year increased by 17 percent. Not bad. We strengthened our position as the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods Next year the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the world market is projected to be 50 percent larger than <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s. Democrats talk about the decline of American industry: midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But they're wrong. Transition and change would be better words. This is what's happening in our country. The fact of the matter is we're in the midst of an industrial revival in this country. A few facts: Between 1974 and 1984, large companies eliminated nearly 1.5 million factory jobs, but at the same time 41,000 new companies created almost as many new industrial jobs. We're in the midst of the longest peacetime expansion: 15.5 million new jobs. Europeans look at it and call it the American miracle. And with good reason. That's more jobs created in the last five years than <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have created in the last 20 years. And do n't believe the myth that those are all bad jobs. Nearly two-thirds of them are in the higher-paid skilled occupations, over 90 percent are full time. I could go on. But I'm in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. And I remember when Mrs. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, the wife of the great <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> senator, said one time, `` I always find that statistics are hard to swallow and impossible to digest. The only one I can ever remember is that if all the people who go to sleep in church were laid end to end, they'd all be a lot more comfortable.''

 To maintain this strong economy, we've got to get the federal budget deficit down. And we've got to do it by holding the line on spending. And the answer for the deficit is for the president to make the tough calls and take the heat. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated that it is unwilling to do that. They appropriate every dime, spend every dime, tell us how to spend every dime. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people see that they're the ones that are responsible. ... And lastly, if I could look back at the end of four years, and somebody said, what have you accomplished? I'd like to be able to say I was the education president. I was the person who backed up those school principals and those good school teachers who know the name of the kids, that are teaching those four values: reading, ` riting, ` rithmetic and respect in the I want to lead the federal government to do more in helping for the disadvantaged, do better a job in helping young families just getting started to save through tax exemptions, save so that they can educate their own kids. It's a partnership. We ca n't turn to the federal government to do it all. But we must do a better job on education. I think people are going to go into that voting booth next fall, and they're going to say: who has the value that we believe in, who has the experience to lead this, the greatest countryon the face of the earth, who has the stability, the integrity, to get the job done? I would n't be asking for your vote if I did n't feel that I am that man. I will never apologize for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I will keep her strong, I will lead her, I will reach out with compassion to all Americans, to make them understand that this indeed is the best, the most generous nation on the face of the earth.

 Before the ink has dried on ad posters and theater tickets, <ORGANIZATION> RCA-Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> has announced it will distribute the upcoming epic adventure, `` Willow.'' No release date was given for home video buyers. The $ 35 million <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> fantasy opens on May 20, and with an advertising budget of $ 20 million is expected to be one of the season's top celluloid winners. It is a beautifully filmed tale of good versus evil, pulling out all the parables from the story of <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> to `` Return of the Jedi.'' There are virtually no stars, the hero is a dwarf and special effects from the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> bag of tricks abound. `` The combination of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> producing and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> directing is sure to result in a wonderful film that will be a big worldwide hit both theatrically and in home video,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> RCA-Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. A superhit that's already proven itself will also be available on home video in the fall _ `` E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video and the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plan a $ 25 million campaign to sell the videocassette, which will retail for a low $ 24.95. The movie, produced by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, tells the story of an endearing little alien from another world who becomes marooned on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It is befriended and given sanctuary by children who protect it from government agents, and who help E.T. return home. `` E.T.,'' the biggest grosser of all time, has made more than $ 228 million in film rentals, and has an estimated worldwide box office of nearly $ 500 million. Videos reviewed this week: `` Throw Momma From the Train'' and `` <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>.''

 `` Throw Momma From the Train'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, VHS @ Beta, $ 89.98, Rated R -RRB- `` Throw Momma From the Train'' could have been titled, `` How to Kill Your Mother and Cure Writer's Block.'' A hopelessly bad writer with a hellion of a mother meets a college professor who ca n't get past the first three words of a book he's trying to write and despises his far more successful former wife. Inspired by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s `` Strangers on a Train,'' the aspiring writer proposes a Hitchcockian double murder, and ensnares the unwitting professor in his plot. You have to like a movie like that. Yet this film, a box-office sleeper starring <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> as the mother-hater and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> who is terrific as the schlemiel professor, never quite fulfills the potential of its hilarious premise. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, who showed himself a true comic genius in his TV role as <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> DePalma </PERSON> in `` Taxi,'' is only fleetingly funny in this film. This also represents <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>'s debut as a feature film director, and he does n't rev `` Throw Momma'' up to the comic pitch one would hope for. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>'s energy and ingenious timing are enough to keep the film moving. And he gets hilarious help from <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> who won a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her work as the Momma with the face of a harpy and a voice that makes nails on a chalkboard sound sweet by comparison. As <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> tries to draw Crystal into his matricide scheme, he says, `` Look. Just meet her. Maybe she's someone you'd like to kill.'' It is no small feat for a film to make matricide acceptable. And often very funny. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 `` <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>'' is the kind of movie one would rather forget. It is so jumbled, so poorly written, acted and edited that it makes `` Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'' look like a work of genius. It is not a film one should pay money to see on the big screen. However, you wo n't be too angry if you merely rent a videocassette. The story, oblique at best, revolves around <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> -RRB- whose husband, <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> -RRB- dies in a car crash on their wedding day. A few years later, still sloshing through an uneventful and melancholic life in <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION>, she returns home one night to find <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> and their son. However, in this `` new'' life, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> also has taken a lover, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -LRB- Sting -RRB-, who is given to brutalizing her. Throughout the remainder of the movie, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> roams from this `` ghost'' life to her `` real'' life. But it's hard to separate illusion from reality. It's also hard having any real feeling for the characters because, with the exception of Sting, they are transparent and not terribly interesting _ especially <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. As an actress, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s ability is questionable: She seems to be the end result of a well-oiled hype machine. In `` <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>,'' she's about as convincing and compelling as a box of prunes, given to long intakes of air and misplaced angst where she should be a confused, tragic heroine. Nor is she particularly sensual _ seemingly her strong point, if we are to believe the hype machine. Rather, she is largely narcoleptic. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> does the best he can with a limp script, but remains tepid at best. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Rock of Life'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Springfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Springfield </PERSON> bares his soul on `` Rock of Life,'' his first album in three years. He attributes the hiatus to burnout, which he describes on the title cut and `` World Start Turning.'' On the latter he sings, `` Made a promise to myself _ I'll never get that low again.'' The problem is that <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>'s confessional is delivered, for the most part, via mechanical, repetitive arrangements and layered harmonies compressed into music that's obviously aimed at Top 40 radio. The result is a record that sounds impersonal despite its autobiographical nature. It's too bad, because <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> went into the studio with something to say. `` God bless the house, the car and the TV; they built us a prison without any locks,'' he sings on `` Tear It All Down.'' But the only arrangements that work are `` Honeymoon in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' a dead ringer for Hall and <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, and a thundering cover of the Small Faces' `` -LRB- If You Think You're -RRB- Groovy.'' Elsewhere, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> lets his blues get buried in overdubs that turn `` Rock of Life'' to rubble. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987 -LRB- MCA -RRB- _ `` Southern by the Grace of God'' Now ask yourself, does the world really need another 13-minute version of `` Free Bird,'' sung this time by a few thousand off-key concertgoers from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>? Of course not. But such worldly questions obviously never faze record company executives. That's why records such as `` Southern by the Grace of God,'' credited to the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987 are stacked in the stores. Survivors of this influential Southern rock band, which lost three members in a 1977 plane crash, reunited for a tour last year to cash in on the group's memory. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON> replaced his brother, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, as the singer and frontman for the new Skynyrd. Not real, as the copywriters like to say, but an incredible simulation. You ca n't argue too much about a tour, since worse things have been done in the name of nostalgia. A live record is another story. In an attempt to pay tribute to such songs as `` Free Bird'' and `` Sweet Home <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>,'' the reconstituted Skynyrd only demeans them. How can expecting fans to pay money to hear other fans sing a cherished song be viewed as anything but an insult? Why ask fans to pay for sub-par reruns of songs when the originals are easily available? Even setting aside the concept, the record is sloppy. It opens with an address to a crowd in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, switches to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> a few songs later, then quickly heads back to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. A little editing would have eased the sense of disorientation. The gratuitious profanity can go, too. It's also one of those recordings better suited to the CD format than an awkward two-album set. `` Free Bird,'' with 13:11 of music, fills an entire side. The surviving Skynyrds do n't musically embarrass themselves, but that's not the point. There's no excuse for turning <ORGANIZATION> Lynyrd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skynyrd </ORGANIZATION> into another `` Beatlemania.'' _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Casebook of Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Her life is a casebook of survival, and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> is talking about it these days with complete candor, revealing her forbidden love for <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and the deception by her former husband, writer <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. She is calling attention to her autobiography, `` As I Am,'' by doing interviews; three a day is all she can manage. The effects of her near-fatal stroke and a Job-like series of tragedies are still apparent: difficulty in walking, furtive searches for words and memories. But she dismisses her failings with the familiar throaty laugh. Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s voice retains that mellow quality that fascinated viewers of `` The Fountainhead,'' `` A Face in the Crowd,'' `` Hud,'' for which she received the Academy Award as best actress, and `` The Subject Was Roses.'' It reflects the years as wife and mother in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, but the undertones of her beginnings in <LOCATION> Packard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, are unmistakable. And there is no mistaking that she remains, at 62, a rare beauty. `` As I Am,'' written with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNeut </PERSON>, tells it all. She arrived in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in 1948 after a smashing success on Broadway in `` Another Part of the Forest.'' All of the studios sought her, but she signed a <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> contract because <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> promised her the hit play `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loves </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>.'' Her co-star was <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` When I started ` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loves </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>,' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> announced that she was divorcing <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>,'' Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> recalled, `` so he did n't have an easy time on that film. Then I did ` The Fountainhead,' and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and I both went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to do ` The Hasty Heart.' We lived side by side in a hotel, and while we never dated, we often went to dinner together. `` I was in love with someone he did n't know about; no one did. And he was still very much enamored of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>. After we finished the picture, he went back and started going with his present wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>.'' The romance that no one knew about was with her `` Fountainhead'' co-star, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. It had to be secret, because he was married to the socialite <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> `` Rocky'' <PERSON> Balfe </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> writes that <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> once hit her because she dated <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and that she had an abortion after becoming pregnant by <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. Why is she finally telling the story of her love for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>? `` Well, if I write a book on my life, and I leave <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> out, it wo n't be a real, true story,'' she said. `` He was my great passion for a long time. Looking back, I still adore him and will always adore him. He was ` my man.' `` When it first started, I did n't think of marrying <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> ever. It was just my quick love, and I hoped that no one would know. But I really loved him and it went on and on. In the end we had to break it up.'' In 1953 Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> married the writer of mystery and children's stories, <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> They settled in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missenden </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and had three children. The tragedies began: Baby Theo was hit by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> taxi and nearly died; young <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> died suddenly of measles. Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> suffered a massive stroke while preparing to film `` Seven Women'' with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. Only after 21 days did her doctor tell <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> that his wife, who was pregnant, would live. `` It was a hard time to learn to talk again, to walk again,'' she said. `` I did n't know one word from the other. My son had great cards with words written on them _ ` he,' ` she,' ` cat,' ` dog' _ and he would hold them up to me.'' Recovery was long and slow, and she was constantly driven by <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. Their fourth child, <PERSON> Ophelia </PERSON>, was born with no ill effects from her mother's illness. In 1968 <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> pushed his wife into doing the film `` The Subject Was Roses'' much against her will, though she was later glad that she did it. She continued acting in films and television, always returning to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missenden </LOCATION>. What she did n't know was that <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> was carrying on an affair with <PERSON> Felicity </PERSON> <PERSON> Crossland </PERSON>, an English fashion coordinator. `` My husband was a tricky man, it turned out,'' Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know how many years he had other women. In the end he wanted a divorce so he could marry his now-wife. `` I was so bitter! You have no idea how horrible I was. But all of a sudden it vanished. I do n't feel bitter anymore.'' The family stayed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> now lives in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment and a summer home on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, who first contacted her after the strokes, had recommended a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> abbey where Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> found solace in retreats. She wrote her book there. It was also through <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> that she met <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. `` When Rocky's second husband died, I wrote her a letter,'' Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. `` She was so delighted with it, and I got a letter from her. It was written on the birthday of my darling <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>, the one who died. It's extraordinary how these things happen on a certain day.'' A meeting was arranged, and the two women shared memories of the man they both loved. How has she managed to survive her disasters? `` When something happens, you think it's going to kill you,'' she replied. `` But it does n't kill you, so you live through that. When the second one happens, you get stronger. You get stronger all the time, all the time. Even though I have a filthy temper when things go wrong and I have no control over them, I realize that I have no control. `` I have survived so far. I've been told by three fortunetellers that I'm going to live till 95. So you can see that I have some years left.''

<HEAD>The Artists: New Arts Center Guards Against Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A huge water tank hangs suspended between the dome of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s new opera house and the elaborate tiers of its flower-shaped ceiling. The tank underlines the designers' determination that the beige-colored, neo-Islamic-style <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Culture Center wo n't suffer the same fate as the <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, its historic predecessor: destruction by fire. Built in 1869 for the inauguration of the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION>, the ornate old <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> went up in flames in 1971, an unexplained fire that left <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s culture lovers bereft and homeless. The new Japanese-built center houses a 1,300-seat opera house, two smaller theaters, a museum, a library, an art gallery, a conference hall and artistic training rooms. Still, everyone from builders to the media refer to the center as `` The New Opera.'' It was turned over to the Culture Ministry on March 10 and will have its official inauguration on Oct. 10. The loss of the old house, in which plays for the common man were as likely to be presented as grand opera, was a trauma for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Thousands of Cairenes stood in horror on Oct. 28, 1971, watching their beloved <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> burn for several days. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s main firefighting station was less than 100 yards away, but experts said the fire could not be stopped. The building was primarily made of timber, and hundreds of costumes and props helped feed the flames. `` I was there, with many Egyptians, standing and crying as we watched it burn,'' said <PERSON> Magda </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, 43, the new opera's director. Fire precautions have been installed. The water tank has a capacity of 78,000 gallons. There's also fire-resistant fabrics and materials throughout the complex, sprinkler and smoke-detection systems, 158 fire extinguishers and a huge fire-resistant curtain between the stage and the audience. <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, a former prima ballerina with the ballet company of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, expects big things from the center. `` It's a magnificent facility,'' she said. `` We anticipate it will revolutionize culture in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and we hope the whole region and internationally as well.'' The complex, located on <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s posh <LOCATION> Zamalek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, was financed by a 1984 grant from the Japanese government of 6.5 billion yen, then worth $ 30 million. No expense has been spared: Swedish pine floors, Italian marble and Japanese electronics. The complex's interior color schemes vary from light pink to crimson and dark coral, and the sharply sloping main auditorium features plush floor seats topped by horseshoe-shaped tiers of boxes. In the main hall, most walls are covered with ceramics, which Japanese architects said was for acoustics as much as for easy maintenance. The ceiling is fiberglass and Czech crystal, shaped like a kind of flower uniting the Egyptian lotus and the Japanese cherry blossom. The stage is large by world standards, with a maximum width of 53 feet, a height of 30 feet and a depth of 109 feet. A Japanese construction company, <ORGANIZATION> Kajima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, built the seven-story complex in 34 months. Miss <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said she is organizing an elaborate inauguration ceremony as she tries to piece together the opera's first season. At the Oct. 10 inauguration gala, traditional Egyptian and Japanese classical music and Western classics will be performed, climaxing a month of celebrations that will include open-air festivals along the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> outside the complex's front gate. For the inaugural season, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> has booked the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> ballet troupes and hopes to sign <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Bolshoi ballet, personally requested by President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Festival ballet will open the season on Oct. 25 with `` <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylphides </PERSON>,'' a ballet that has never been performed in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` The opera will be a home for Egyptian artists, but I have also been contacting African, Asian and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> groups,'' Miss <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said. `` We will not be limited to opera, ballet and symphony. Any variety of excelled art will be invited.'' She said ticket prices for the new center have not been set but that she is aiming to keep them fairly low so average Egyptians will not be deprived of the arts. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> specifically asked for the opera house on a visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1983. It raised eyebrows that his request for aid should be for a culture center instead of other, more pressing economic needs. Miss <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s prima ballerina from 1966-71, said she hopes the complex will become an educational center, a gathering place for young artists and a place where young Egyptians can learn to appreciate the arts. One stumbling block she expects is money, both to maintain the huge complex and to attract internationally acclaimed performers. She would not say how much money the financially strapped government has budgeted for the opera house, but she said she hopes to receive subsidies from the <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and to start local and regional systems of fund raising.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Slice of Southern Life for Bruce Hornsby</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is more than just <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>'s home state. It's the source of the preachers, pregnant girls, gossips and good ol' boys who populate his slice-of-Southern-life songs. `` A lot of our inspiration comes from Southern literature. ... This album, to us, we tried to make it a musical version of a short-story collection,'' <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> said of his `` Scenes From the Southside,'' the follow-up to 1986's platinum record `` The Way It Is.'' `` I read a lot _ I read a lot of fiction _ and I guess that influences my writing,'' said <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, who cited little-known Southern writers <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> as favorites. `` I want it to have that same sort of quality.'' On his debut album with his band, The Range, <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> was able to do just that, racking up three hit singles, including the title track. His success was the result of persistence as much as talent _ <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> was rejected repeatedly until signing with <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and watching his career take off. The new record is filled with characters from <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>'s days in his hometown of <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, from the shady evangelists of `` Jacob's Ladder'' and `` Defenders of the Flag'' to the small-town gossips of `` The Show Goes On.'' `` We're just writing about things that happen in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> certainly come from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the past several years. `` Everybody thinks we wrote about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, but we've known about this stuff for years: people in high places doing less than admirable things.'' Going into the studio to record the second album was a much different experience from the first time around, <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> said. His brother and writing partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was in law school, forcing <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> to write more alone; there was also pressure to produce another hit. `` Frankly, the pressure on the first album was more intense, because it was more of a survival thing,'' said <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>. `` If that record had just come out and stiffed, we might not have gotten another shot. `` The pressure of this one is different. It's like, well, if we fell on our faces last time, nobody would've known about it; if we fall on our faces this time, everybody knows about it. There's always that sophomore jinx thing. To fight that, `` Scenes From the Southside'' is a bit different from the first album _ `` a lot more jams, there's a lot of soloing, a lot more piano. It's a lot more stretched out,'' <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> said during a recent interview. He's also not too worried about critical reception of the record. `` We write the song because it means something to us as a story from our past, and musically as an interesting combination of styles,'' he said. `` That's what we think about _ not whether it's going to go along with the new Pebbles record. <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> was referring to the single by Pebbles called `` Girlfriend'' which has shot up the record charts and remains in the Top 10. <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>'s first single from the new LP, `` The <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>,'' features a piano riff over a straight-ahead rock beat much in the style of jazz keyboardist <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> said. `` One thing's for sure: ` The Valley Road' does n't sound a ... thing like anything on the radio. That's either the good news or the bad news; we'll see,'' he said. <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, an accomplished accordionist in addition to his piano and organ playing, has also kept busy working with other artists. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who scored a Top 10 hit with his version of `` <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s Ladder,'' again recruited <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> for his new album; <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> returned the favor by playing harmonica on `` Defenders of the Flag. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> have co-written a song for the ex-Eagle's next solo album; <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> has also contributed accordion work on upcoming albums by <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the Eurhythmics, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> But it's still the Southern social observations that <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> enjoys best. And after several years in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he's moving back to <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he'll store away more material for future albums. Unless ... `` Who knows? Maybe we'll move back there and write about <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> said, his voice giving way to a laugh.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Hughes Hoaxer Hypes Houston Homicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mention `` the hoax'' and <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> casts his eyes downward, shakes his head and offers a smirk of mild disgust that 16 years and six books later the subject still pops up. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> would like to talk about books he has written, not about the chicanery that put him in prison in the early 1970s after he duped a publisher out of $ 650,000 by claiming he had compiled an autobiography of the late reclusive billionaire <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. The bearded, pensive New Yorker is something of a recluse himself now, living in a small Mexican mountain community. He has emerged to talk about his latest book _ a chronicle of the 1982 murders of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lawyer and his wife, plotted by their daughter, carried out by her boyfriend, uncovered by a private eye. But he knows the Hughes scam will dog him to the end. `` I just do n't want to talk about it because I do n't think it's fair It's so long ago. Whatever penalties there are for avoiding the question, I will endure them. I just do n't want to discuss it,'' he said. But ask <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> about `` Daddy's Girl: The Campbell Murder Case'' -LRB- Summit Books, $ 19.95 -RRB- and he'll ramble on about the underbelly of American life and the criminal justice system he says he discovered while researching _ and ultimately becoming a player in _ the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case. In June 1982, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 55, and his wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 50, were killed by a .45 - caliber pistol while they The killer fired over their two grandchildren, who were asleep at the foot of the bed. Nearly three years later, a 23-year-old private detective named <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> romanced <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duval </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> into confessing to the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> murders. He was convicted of murder. The <ORGANIZATION> Campbells </ORGANIZATION>' daughter, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, was found guilty in a separate trial of plotting the crime in order to gain an inheritance. For <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, what started as a trip to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in search of a good dentist ended as a two-year investigation culminating with the author taking the stand to dispute the testimony of a key prosection witness. `` My interest was superficial at the beginning _ a beautiful young private eye seduces a murderer into confession,'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said during a promotional swing through <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Then I got to know the murderer _ the alleged murderer _ and I was n't so sure he had done it.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> testified in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> trial that a witness he had interviewed lied on the stand when he said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> had made him get drunk in order to obtain information. He battled with a prosecutor. `` I was so involved at this point that I could n't believe it,'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said. `` I certainly had never intended it.'' His involvement stretched to attending judge's conferences with attorneys, taping courtroom proceedings despite a court ban and developing close friendships with lawyers on both sides of the case. The experience was uniquely Texan. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is different. It's still the frontier, the Wild West,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, dressed in a brown tweed jacket and a pair of elephant-hide boots. `` Certainly the intimacy of the courtroom is different. It's clubby. A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer who knew what I was doing said you could never do this in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, you could never get that close.'' Since the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> trials ended last year, the 55-year-old <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION>, population 20,000, where he lives with the youngest of his three sons. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s steely blue eyes and public love affairs once commanded as much attention as the hoax. He's living alone now, adding that after four divorces, `` I'm not very good at domesticity.'' He's working on a new project, a `` twisty novel about the ethics of the law'' set in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A screenplay about young love in the 1950s is on hold because of a strike by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> writers. CBS is negotiating to make a TV movie out of the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> case. And he hopes an <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> screenplay of his 1982 novel `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>'' will get produced. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> says credibility is no longer an issue. `` I do n't think about that anymore,'' he said. `` I know I'm credible Everyone in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> knows they can count on me. This book was well researched.'' In 1972, though, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, that he had compiled an autobiography of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> as the result of 100 secret meetings, which never took place. The book was deemed a fraud, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> was sentenced to 2 -LCB- years in prison and he became an instant celebrity, appearing on the cover of Time as `` Con Man of the Year.'' For <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, it's nothing more than a footnote to his career, not how he wishes to be defined.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Alabama Fights For Eminence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, whose rousing instrumentals and moving ballads have set the standard for country music in the 1980s, is fighting to maintain its eminence. The group with foot-stomping fiddle tunes and mesmerizing melodies has drastically reduced its concert appearances, is winning fewer awards and learning that No. 1 records are no longer automatic. Nevertheless, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> guitarist <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> says: `` We've been written off several times, but my feeling is we're together and making the best music we've ever made and things are better in more ways than ever We've worked out any problems we had. We're contented.'' The four-member band has sold about 30 million records in the past eight years since the group, which hails from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Payne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, left a beach bar in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where they played for tips. They won back-to-back Grammy awards in 1983 and 1984 for `` Mountain Music'' and `` The Closer You Get.'' The group starred in a network TV special and performed up to 300 days on the road each year. But as new acts came along and country fans formed new allegiances, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> now finds its once-torrid pace a bit tempered. <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said the group will perform 80 to 90 concerts this year, down from 130 in 1987, and one-third of their frantic schedule five years ago. `` You have to cut back in markets for a year or two,'' he said. The group won dozens of awards this decade, but their bulging trophy case has not inherited as much hardware in the past couple of years. The Judds, Highway 101 and the Forester Sisters have won some of the awards that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> had a lock on a few years ago. `` We can grow as artists and writers,'' <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We've got a lot of good years left. It would be a detriment to win more awards.'' In November, their personal and autobiographical song, `` Tar Top,'' was the first <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> single to fail to reach No. 1 on the country music charts after 21 in a row spanning a remarkable eight years. `` We felt it was different and we agreed to put it out even if it might not make No. 1,'' <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said. `` We wanted it out for the band and for the fans. `` Another No. 1 would not have done us any good at that point,'' he said. `` It was a controversial song and it got people to talk about the group again. It accomplished what we set out for it to do. `` It got the other record companies off our backs. They had parties and celebrated.'' The group _ three of the four are cousins _ bounced back with a No. 1 record in January, `` Face to Face.'' Though their career has evened off, the band can boast of stirring hit records such as `` Dixieland Delight'' and `` Old Flame,'' and sensuous, softer songs such as `` Touch Me When We're Dancing'' and `` Feels So Right. They've had so many hits that at concerts they are forced to perform three medleys and trim the length of several other songs. `` We have to leave out a bunch,'' said <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, who once laid carpet for a living. They pioneered the sound of country bands and their success led <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> record companies to sign other groups such as Exile and Restless Heart. Says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonsall </PERSON>, lead singer for the rival <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, `` They are the greatest act that's ever been in our business.'' <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, analyzing the band's success, points to versatility, organization, energy and other factors. `` We've been able to write our own songs,'' he said. `` Early in your career, you do n't get pitched the good songs that others do. We've put together the best organization I know of, from management to the road crew. They've been with us for years. `` We've tried to act as good businessmen. We go to the functions and meet the people and do those things. `` We've had a range of material,'' he continued. `` Kids identify with some of it, and the good ol' boys with gun racks in their pickup trucks like others, and there are the gentle love songs that women like. We like our range of music and we're capable of doing a lot of songs. `` We've not been afraid to change; we've been independent. `` There's a real feeling by the people that we give them everything we've got _ all the feeling, all the energy we can for that applause. The people know when you're playing for yourself or when you're playing for them. `` I like to sit and watch the people come in to the concert and study them _ ` I wonder what he does for a living.' It amazes me that so many types of people enjoy our music.''

 Entrepreneurs are playing an increasingly important role in leading the nation's largest black-owned companies, according to a new survey. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> magazine's latest annual survey of the top 100 black-owned industrial and service companies, released Monday, indicates black entrepreneurs are becoming more active in sectors ranging from manufacturing and advertising to construction and franchising. The entrepreneurs, many of whom are using non-traditional financing techniques to acquire and restructure companies, are different from traditional executives who have been with the same company for years, working to build it up. The rise of black entrepreneurs mirrors developments in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in general, many of which have been taken over or been forced to restructure to face competition and an uncertain economy. A key example is Wall Street attorney <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, by far the largest black-owned company. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION>, a food processor and distributor formed from the $ 985 million leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, also was the fastest-growing, according to the survey. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the target company with sales of its assets or from its cash flow.

<HEAD>Central Bank Chief Says Dollar Parity is Not Part of Free-Trade
Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Canadian dollar's sharp two-year rise stemmed mainly from higher interest rates, not from any secret deal under the nation's pending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pact, according to the head of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s central bank. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said Monday that the Canadian dollar's nearly 31 percent rise since February 1986 came as Canadian interest rates were being driven higher to help cool domestic inflationary pressures. The Canadian dollar rose from an all-time low of 69 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents in February 1986 to more than 81 cents in April. Opposition parties and other commentators have suggested that Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> sacrificed the advantages of a weaker currency _ which makes Canadian products relatively cheaper in foreign markets _ in order to secure the Free Trade Agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There is no deal on the exchange rate at all,'' <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said at a meeting with foreign correspondents. The trade pact was signed Jan. 2 and is to be ratified later this year. It would eliminate all tariffs and dismantle many non-tariff barriers in what is already the world's biggest trading partnership. Some Canadian exporters have complained that Canadian dollar's rise had cost them foreign business For example, <ORGANIZATION> Noranda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the forestry and resource giant, has said it lost $ 80 million in profit last year because of the currency's surge. <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> acknowledged such complaints, but noted that the Canadian currency's rise had been halted last month. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> figures released last week indicated the central bank spent more than $ 1 billion during April to keep a lid on the Canadian currency, which closed Monday at 80.72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents. <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> also said the trade pact did not mean the two currencies eventually would become equal.

Asked what he would like to see emerge from the summit, <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said that whatever initiatives were taken or statements made, he hoped `` they do n't give the impression we're off on another round of world inflation.'' <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> also expressed concern about inflationary pressures in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which had the developed world's highest economic growth rate of 5.75 percent last year and anticipates a 17 percent increase in factory investment this year. But with latest figures showing growth stalled at the start of this year, he forecast reduced demand in 1988, which he said should help curb inflation.

 Workers will begin assembling cars at the new <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> plant two months ahead of schedule in early September, due to quick plant construction, the automaker has announced. Construction of the $ 650 million Diamond-Star plant, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, finished several months early, allowing the assembly line to start rolling sooner than expected. `` We're very pleased with the progress of the plant construction and have been able to remain ahead of schedule throughout the start-up process,'' Diamond-Star Chairman <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Garder </PERSON> said in a news release issued Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> will build a two-door, front-wheel-drive coupe for the 1989 model year. The car will be sold at prices starting below $ 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will market the vehicle as the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which has 205 dealerships in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also will distribute the car but has not announced its name.

 A woman was found guilty of killing her husband and a woman to collect more than $ 175,000 in insurance, and the prosecutor says the conviction in the nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial will stop drug tamperers. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of suburban <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted Monday of all five counts in the deaths of her 52-year-old husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, also of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Federal court jurors, who deliberated nearly five days, said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter's testimony against her mother proved crucial. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, scheduled for sentencing June 17, could receive life in prison. Prosecutors also are considering state murder charges. `` It was all there for -LRB- jurors -RRB- to make this decision,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said, adding that the verdict will `` be a deterrent'' to would-be drug tamperers. Jury foreman <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 55, said the panel was split 11-1 in favor of conviction through its first three votes. Juror <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, who wept when the verdict was announced, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> on Monday she received an anonymous call Friday from a woman who said, `` Do n't you all know she -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> -RRB- failed the lie detector test?'' Results of Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s polygraph test were not introduced as evidence. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> said she told no other jurors about the call and vowed to disregard the information when the judge told her to do so. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>, who declined <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s offer to excuse Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, said Monday night he planned to appeal. `` Assuming the 11-1 split included a vote of not guilty by the same juror who reported having been tampered with earlier this morning, then it's my belief that that's no coincidence and that that has to be investigated if for no other reason than to insure the integrity of the jury system,'' he said. The testimony of <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s 28-year-old daughter, was decisive. `` I think without <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>'s testimony there were, you might say, too many missing links in the chain of evidence,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> testified her mother discussed killing <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> by a drug overdose or by hiring a hit man. Although prosecutors were unable to link Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> directly to cyanide purchases, she was convicted of all five counts she faced, two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce and three of tampering. Beset by financial problems and unhappy in her marriage, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules with cyanide and gave them to her husband for a headache, prosecutors said. To make his death appear random, she poisoned other bottles of Excedrin and Anacin capsules and put them on store shelves. Ms. Snow died after swallowing capsules from one of those bottles, six days after <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, the prosecution said. Her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Webking </PERSON>, said she might still be alive if local authorities had recognized the real cause of <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s death, initially attributed to emphysema. `` The effect of the verdict is secondary to the fact that Sue is dead,'' Webking said. `` No matter what the verdict is, Sue's going to be dead.'' `` I wish they'd hang her to the highest tree,'' said Ms. Snow's mother, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Artesia </LOCATION>, N.M. King County Prosecutor <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleng </PERSON> said he would wait until after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges The deaths of <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> and Ms. Snow touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its capsuled, non-prescription medicines. `` Product tampering is intolerable to society,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, spokesman for New York-based Bristol-Myers, said. `` When it occurs every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to bring them to justice,'' he said. Seven people died in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1982 from cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> accused Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> of poisoning her husband to collect on his life insurance. <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was the victim of a lying daughter who stood to gain a $ 300,000 reward from pharmaceutical companies for information leading to an arrest. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s plan failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules, greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted bottles of painkillers recovered, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said in closing arguments. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, a tropical fish enthusiast, used a bowl contaminated with an algaeicide for cleaning fish tanks when she mixed potassium cyanide with the Anacin and Excedrin painkillers, the prosecution alleged. Traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also lied about insurance policies and pressed medical authorities for a more specific cause of death, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> stood to receive $ 71,000 in insurance if the death of her husband was from emphysema, as pathologists first concluded, but could have gotten $ 176,000 if the death were ruled accidental, the prosecutor said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also left fingerprints on library books about poisons and cyanide, Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Appearing on television for the first time to discuss his landmark cigarette liability lawsuit was a little embarrassing for retired construction worker <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. But he got used to that. But things were different when a lawyer for one of the tobacco company defendants started discussing the behavior of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a 40-year smoker who died of lung cancer `` It bothered me, and I felt like getting up and punching him in the mouth,'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> said. `` But I kept cool and calm.'' The soft-spoken, 64-year-old Italian immigrant would n't say what statement he was referring to. Throughout the trial, attorneys for the cigarette companies have focused on Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s behavior to show she smoked of her own free will, despite repeated warnings from her husband about the dangers. The angry statement was an exception for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, a mild man given to sweater vests, kind smiles and friendly greetings in the corridors of the federal courthouse in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. For four months, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> has sat quietly and patiently behind the plaintiff's table as a dozen attorneys battle over a case that has become a cause celebre for anti-smoker forces and a concern for the $ 22 billion tobacco industry. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> died in 1984 at age 58. Her husband's is the face behind the heading `` <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> v. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, et al.,'' which has appeared atop dozens of court opinions, some of which have established important precedents on procedural issues. Decisions in the case have passed through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, appellate panels and state courts nationwide. The name <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> has been uttered on national television and written on the pages of most major news publications. Despite his new place in the public light and American jurisprudence, `` I did not change one bit. At all,'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> said in a light accent of his native land during an interview last week. `` I'm still the same. I'll be the same the rest of my life.'' The case is considered important because of the breadth of internal tobacco company documents obtained by the plaintiffs, and the possible public relations harm to an industry that has never paid damages to someone suing it for making a product that allegedly brought on disease and death. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> charges three companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ are liable for his wife's illness by covering up the dangers of smoking. The companies counter that she was an intelligent woman who smoked because she wanted to, despite knowing the dangers. They deny smoking causes lung cancer. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> says he approaches his prominence with a sense of responsibility. But if he should win, putting the <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> name firmly in history? `` I would be proud that I did something,'' he said. `` The thing is, with this case, my wife started it and I pursued the case. Because she told me, ` In case anything should happen to me, you should pursue the case.'' The lawsuit was filed a year before Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> died. A lifetime of hard work did not prepare <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> for what he is doing now. `` I did n't have the slightest idea that this would take so long,'' he said. Born in a small village in the countryside between <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on Aug. 31, 1923, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at age 15 with his mother and two sisters. They lived in an Italian section of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. He went to work in construction, helping build the 1939 World's Fair grounds, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airport He met <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> at an outdoor opera in the neighborhood when she asked him to move aside so she could see. After marrying, the couple moved to a larger apartment in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, and then a house in Little Ferry, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He worked for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> from 1960 to 1979, splicing cables used to lift loads of steel. He had his own cable business from 1978 until retiring in 1986. When the case ends, which appears likely in late May or early June, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> plans to enjoy the end of his daily court visits. `` Believe me, for one week I'm going to stay home in the sun,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contintental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> appears to be seeking a `` white knight'' to avert a proposed takeover by British sugar refiner <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. Stley officials said Monday they were negotiating with at least one other party interested in acquiring part or all of the company based in this northwest <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> surburb. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> spokesman, would not identify the parties. `` The significance here is that we've commenced negotiations,'' he said. `` There is a significant difference between discussions and negotiations.'' News of the negotiations confirmed reports last week that <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, the country's second-largest refiner of corn syrup and a leading producer of food-service supplies, had discussed selling all or part of the company to third parties. The company also said Monday it would continue to explore other options to enhance shareholder values, including a financial restructuring or recapitalization, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout. Also Monday, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> officials announced two favorable court decisions upholding the validity of the company's shareholder-rights plan and other measures taken to defend against the <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> takeover bid The plan's validity was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, they said, while the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> upheld the constitutionality of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> takeover statute as it applies to <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said he was pleased with the court rulings denying <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s requests for preliminary injunctions. `` The rights plan is obviously serving a useful purpose in allowing the company to seek a more realistic offer,'' <PERSON> Nordlund </PERSON> said. Industry analysts have mentioned Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a company that may have an interest in acquiring <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> CFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> food-service division. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in a bidding war for CFS Continental in October 1984. But several analysts contacted Monday refused to speculate on which companies might be talking with <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>. `` I've seen the company's statement but I do n't have any more information on that myself,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everything that can be said has been said,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Blunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loewi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm just waiting for something to occur that's concrete and palpable, and I do n't know what it's going to be. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s board of directors last week advised the company's shareholders to reject <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s second cash tender offer, which totals about $ 1.42 billion, or $ 35 a share In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> closed up 50 cents at $ 38.75 Monday. Analysts have said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> has a fair market value of about $ 40 a share. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s second-largest sugar refiner, owns about 5 percent of <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>'s stock and wants to acquire the entire company for its A.E. <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> was based in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, until about three years ago, when it moved its headquarters to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs.

The application was based on the belief that it would be in the best public interest for <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION> to own <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> has been required by the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> to divest the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> because a merger between it and the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> would have essentially ended railroad competition in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and other markets served by the two railroads, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> chose to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, rather than to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION>, for what we believe to be purely anti-competitive reasons,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION>'s operating plan, filed Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, calls for the purchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years. `` In contrast, the <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> interests, which control the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, appear to treat the acquisition as primarily a real estate play, and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives over essentially the same period,'' he said. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>'s vice president and general counsel, said his company would n't neglect the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>. It would lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalize on financial and tax benefits, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> runs across about 1,900 miles, from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. It has n't revealed details for combining its small local work force with that of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 280 employees. Monday was the deadline for comments about the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed sale to be filed with regulators. Also opposing the deal were Missouri Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>'s purchase was backed by most shippers, regulators and other railroads. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> expects to rule in mid-August on the sale plan. Regulators last June killed <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to merge the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, which it also owns. They feared that a merger of the two big lines, whose tracks overlap in many areas, would stifle competition and increase shipping rates. Early last year <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> began a furious campaign to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>. But the lobbying did n't prevent <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> from naming the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> as the railroad's buyer in late December.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday cleared a 17.7 percent holding in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The clearance came in the form of a decision by the trade department not to refer the holding to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. However, the department's approval refers just to General Cinema's current shareholding in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, a department spokeswoman said. The matter could face further scrutiny by <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> officials should <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> increase its holding or make a full takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, said the spokeswoman, who was not identified in accordance with British custom. <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s share price bounded ahead 16 pence, or 30 cents, to 334 pence, or $ 6.28 per share by early afternoon on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on the news. The Chestnut Hill, Mass.-based General Cinema, which has interests in movie theaters and soft drink bottling, said late last month that it planned to increase its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> and might try to acquire the British soft drink and candy maker. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON>, a director of investor relations at <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, said he was heartened by the fact that the government could still initiate a monopolies panel investigation, but he said Tuesday's news nevertheless came as a disappointment <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadbury </PERSON> last week called for the government to block foreign raids on the British confectionery industry.

 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airway </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union today demanded labor representatives on the company's board, and threatened to strike if expired contracts are not signed. `` We can strike them at any time. We can strike them over Memorial Day or the Fourth of July,'' warned <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, calling the date merely a matter of organization. Speaking before the carrier's annual shareholder's meeting here, he said morale among the workers of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> `` is at an all-time low,'' with people `` leaving the company in droves.'' The Teamsters represent more than 4,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s 28,000 employees, chiefly reservations, clerical and cargo staff, and their contract expired in February. Incoming President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> was expected later today in his first formal address to the company to appeal to employees to save <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. He was hired in January to steer the nation's eighth-largest carrier back to profitability He formerly worked at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> under <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> Genoese said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> continues to lose money and will not regain its financial health until it has signed contracts with all five unions, allowing the company to borrow money to recapitalize. `` My objective is to try to move the company in the right direction,'' said Genoese. He said he wants the company to sit down with all the unions togehter to complete the contract talks, and wants union leaders to serve on the board of directors. `` Their plan was to divide and conquer all the unions,'' but the strategy failed, he said. The Teamsters had threatened to strike when its contract expired in February, but held off. In the first quarter <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 83.3 million, after losing $ 93.6 million in the same period last year. For 1987 the company lost $ 262 million, compared to $ 462 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Expert Panel Suggests Taxing Car Owners On Distance Traveled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swiss car owners could be taxed on the distance they travel each year as a new incentive for combating pollution, government experts say. The idea was unveiled Monday in a government-ordered study of possible alternatives to the current annual motor vehicle tax based on engine size. Mileage could be monitored with special counters connected to the axle costing about 300 Swiss francs, or $ 215, each, the report by a panel of financial experts said. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> already uses such a system for diesel vehicles. Similar Swiss measures are considered at least several years away. For example, the report said, the owner of a family car in the <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> area currently pays a yearly vehicle tax equivalent to about $ 330. Under a variable scale, the tax could be pegged to annual travel of 12,800 kilometers, or 9,140 miles, the levy rising or falling proportionally with the actual mileage.

 It took Ghanaian businesswoman <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocloo </PERSON> 30 years to pay off the bank debts for her food processing plant, and with a little help she will be back in debt very soon. <PERSON> Ocloo </PERSON> is hoping local banks in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> will approve a loan request of $ 1,000 so she can expand her operation to fruit juices, jam and canned fruit. She is one of dozens of African entrepreneurs trying to grow with the help of the African Project Development Facility -LRB- APDF -RRB-, a year-old, $ 7.2 million operation sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to help smaller African businesses obtain development financing. Scarcity is a fact of life in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, especially in terms of money. For business people big or small, getting the money to turn development ideas into reality is a major problem. The development project accepts applications from small businesses with annual turnovers between $ 500,000 and $ 5 million and ideas that have a chance for success. It helps them prepare project feasibility studies for potential financiers. The service is free of charge. For four years <PERSON> Kanga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballou </PERSON>, an Ivorian businessman, had been trying to get his hands on a million dollars to start <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s first pencil factory He is very near to realizing that dream. Three out of four local banks have approved loan requests totaling $ 600,000. An APDF feasibility study convinced the bankers of the profitability of <PERSON> Ballou </PERSON>'s idea. He says he and his seven partners can put up the rest of the funding. `` The problem with people like me is that we do n't have the money or knowledge to do these project proposals,'' <PERSON> Ballou </PERSON> said in an interview in his <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION> office. `` For years I approached these banks by myself and I could n't get an answer.'' The reason, he added, was the banks could not afford the risk. <PERSON> Ballou </PERSON> wanted to use local wood to manufacture pencils for a market supplied by more expensive Japanese and European imports. The development project staff sent a wood sample to a European manufacturer for quality tests, which were positive. This was followed by a market study which discovered a healthy demand for cheaper pencils manufactured in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, by Africans. Other West African entrepreneurs interviewed about the <ORGANIZATION> APDF </ORGANIZATION>'s work said the service helped fill a void left by the collapse of African development banks in the late 1970s and early 1980s In <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's biggest producer of cocoa and a leading producer of coffee, the most obvious example of this collapse is Credit de la Cote D'Ivoire, an important local bank, which has suspended its credit operations for businesses. It was set up during the boom days in one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s strongest economies. Most African countries are encumbered by severe economic restraints, including high foreign debts, falling prices for export goods and devastating droughts, which have caused food shortages and mass starvation around the continent. The job of business financing has been left to commercial banks, which are not prepared to risk long-term financing on small businesses, said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> APDF </ORGANIZATION>'s West African operations in <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION>. `` They do n't have the expertise and resources to appraise projects,'' said <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON>. `` So they are careful. Maybe even too careful.'' <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON> and his colleagues do not contend the revival of small businesses is the solution to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economic problems. But it's a start `` What's really exciting here is that we have a group of professionals ... who are sitting with African entrepreneurs and looking at projects from the African point of view,'' said <PERSON> Makarand </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehejia </PERSON>, a consultant to the APDF. `` The results have been quite remarkable.'' Eight businesses in <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> have successfully obtained nearly $ 13 million from national and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> creditors with the <ORGANIZATION> APDF </ORGANIZATION>'s help. It is working with creditors on 21 other projects around <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from regional offices in <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION> and the Kenyan capital of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. In 1987 the development project handled 600 applications, accepting 10 percent. <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON> conceded many businesses were turned away, but he stressed they were trying to help small businesses. This has disqualified many applicants. The development project staff considers 10 percent to be normal for the first year. <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON> said that after one year in operation the APDF is in the `` takeoff stage,'' and will be in full operation by December. `` Many people submit unbankable ideas,'' <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON> added. `` From the word go we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the bankers.'' <PERSON> Saliou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndione </PERSON>, who owns Pechazur, a shrimp fishing and processing company in <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, said African businesses have a credibility problem. He said few African businessmen have experience and the mistakes many made after African nations became independent have contributed to the continent's economic problems. Ndione is building a new factory with a bank loan of 160 million West African francs -LRB- $ 560,000 -RRB- he got with the help of the development project. He wants to improve his product and broaden his sales in <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ndione </PERSON>'s original ideas for expansion were more ambitious and risky, and could have cost a great deal of time and money. The marketing study prepared by <PERSON> Cracco </PERSON> showed the market probably would n't support a huge increase in output. Plans for the new factory were tailored to the study's picture of market demand, which impressed Ndione's creditors. `` The <ORGANIZATION> APDF </ORGANIZATION>'s work was indispensable to us,'' <PERSON> Ndione </PERSON> said. `` The bank took their study much more seriously than if we had done it ourselves.''

 The remote hills of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s gold country are far from the sprawling urban jungle of <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> _ and that's just the way employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> like it A high-tech company where almost everyone, including top executives, wears jeans and sneakers, the <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has been designing and manufacturing state-of-the art video production equipment for almost 25 years. Nestled in the hills outside of town, <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> is by far the biggest private employer in an area where jobs in lumber and light industry can be hard to come by. A sleepy former gold-mining town with fewer than 9,000 residents, the streets are lined with quaint Victorian homes, some of which are opening as bed and breakfast-style inns. An annual bluegrass festival attracts hordes of tourists. The views from <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION>'s international headquarters of wooded hillsides, cows grazing and wide blue sky capture the feel of this decidedly rural area, traversed by roads with names like <LOCATION> Squirrel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Lime </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kiln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. It is an unlikely spot for the design and manufacture of technology that helps bring you everything from `` Monday Night Football'' to the glitzy graphics on the nightly news. `` If a picture is worth a thousand words, we give you a picture every sixteenth of a second,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Tektronix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> has built its reputation on editing units and production switchers, the behind-the-scenes equipment that controls things like which images go over the air during a live sportscast or when one image `` wipes'' or fades to another GVG is also a pioneer in the flashy video effects market. It's <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> equipment that made the Olympics logo tumble across the screen during coverage of the Winter Games in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> Other popular effects can warp an image or give it a three-dimensional look. Thanks to one gizmo, television viewers can watch `` split-screen'' action. Another, called a Kaleidescope, can compress one of the split images so viewers can see an Olympic skier at the top of a mountain while watching another zip for the finish line. On the zanier side, one of <ORGANIZATION> GVG </ORGANIZATION>'s standard products enabled <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> to broadcast his late-night show upside-down one night. And it was <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> wizardry that brought President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 landslide victory to video life as state after state was `` painted'' into the president's corner. `` It was n't too long ago you'd see the person turning the numbers by hand,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` Now it's all done with computers. They'll just pack information into you now. They could n't do that 10 years ago.'' As their equipment has revolutionized what television looks like, the company has introduced some innovations of its own. Located about 150 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> has its own airplane to fly customers in and out of the remote, wooded company headquarters _ `` a plus and minus when it comes to recruitment,'' according to Executive Vice President <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>. Designed to appeal to `` free-thinking'' employees -LRB- one company executive ventured to call them `` mavericks'' -RRB-, flex-time schedules are available for most of the nearly 1,000 workers in <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Assemblers work in self-managed `` cells'' rather than production lines, rotating jobs and setting their own production goals. As an added incentive, a profit-sharing program was introduced in 1976. A fitness trail winds its way through the 330-acres of campus-like grounds and fleets of bright turquoise company bicycles are parked outside each of nine buildings to carry employees and visitors about the grounds. Part of engineer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Click </PERSON>'s job involves teaching customers how to operate their new equipment, some of which looks so complicated that it has appeared as spaceship interiors in `` Star Wars'' and other <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> features. `` If a question comes up during a class and I do n't know the answer,'' <PERSON> Click </PERSON> said, `` I'll just go over to Building 9 where they design the stuff and ask them.'' That sort of attention to detail appears to have been a founding philosophy of the <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which was established in 1959. It's all part of what marketing manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> calls the `` culture'' of the company. Company lore has it that the founder, Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> G.C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, was such an avid environmentalist that he took a two-week vacation when trees had to be felled to make way for a new building. He could n't bear to hear the sound of the saws And if the habits of the free-thinkers at <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> sometimes border on the eccentric, so much the better. One department is so adamantly unorthodox that if an outside salesman makes a call wearing a necktie, he'll more than likely lose it _ to a pair of scissors, according to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Although the company will not release earnings information, officers will say they are in the midst of a 100-acre expansion of their facilities in nearby <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Much of <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION>'s competition comes from Japanese companies like <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Ampex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is a major competitor. With their specialized equipment in television newsrooms and video production houses across the country, <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> is now aiming `` lower in the marketplace,'' toward smaller video production companies. As more companies turn to in-house videos for instruction and promotional purposes, <LOCATION> GVG </LOCATION> plans scaled-down $ 10,000 models of their premier $ 300,000 production switcher. `` Each new generation of equipment offers more capabilities for less dollars,'' said <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> director lost an appeal Tuesday of a court ruling that ordered him to repay a $ 9.8 million fee he received for work during the company's 1986 takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, attorney, had sought to overturn a 1987 High Court ruling that declared unlawful the work agreement with former <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> The $ 9.8 million payment had been made without the approval of the full Guiness board. In making its decision Tuesday, the three <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges also ordered <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> to pay <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' court costs and refused him the option of appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, the last recourse for appeals in the British legal system. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who did n't attend the appeal hearing, had argued that any duty to disclose his interest in the agreement was met by his disclosure to a committee of directors consisting of <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> finance director <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> and himself. But the court ruled that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Companies Act required disclosure to a meeting of the directors and that the committee did n't meet that qualification. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> and six other men currently face multiple charges relating to alleged stock manipulation during the takeover of Distillers, a gin and whisky maker. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has not been charged but <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police have issued a warrant for his arrest. <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> has admitted that its former management arranged for the repurchase of <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> stock, apparently to boost the share price and make <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' cash-and-stock offer more attractive than a rival bid.

<HEAD>Warner to Buy Lorimar in $1.18 Billion Stock Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today they have agreed in principle for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to acquire financially troubled <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> in a stock-swap transaction worth about $ 1.18 billion. Under the agreement between entertainment conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, a major television producer, 0.415 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> common shares would be exchanged for each <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> common share. The deal puts a value of about $ 14 on each of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>'s 47 million outstanding common shares, for a total of around $ 630 million. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would assume <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s debt of about $ 550 million. A merger between the two entertainment companies had been widely expected, since they have been engaged in on-again-off-again merger talks since early March. Several conditions are attached to the deal. For example, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> would be able to terminate the agreement if the average price of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock during the specified period before the closing of the merger does n't result in a price of at least $ 15 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. In that event, and in certain other circumstances, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would get a fee of $ 10 million from <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> earlier rejected a $ 770 million, or $ 17-a-share, takeover bid from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the former owner of <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has indicated he may be willing to go higher, was n't immediately available for comment today <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> told <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in mid-March that it would keep his offer in mind, but <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerer </PERSON> said today the company had no comment on whether that is still its position. <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 12.5 cents to $ 13 a share in midday trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> declined 75 cents to $ 32.87 -LCB-. Another condition of the deal gives <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> an option to purchase 18.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> common stock at $ 15 a share. The option can be exercised if <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> accepts a higher offer from a third party. The agreement requires the approval of each company's board of directors, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and regulatory authorities. Under the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON> would join <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s board as vice chairman. `` The acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> ... will expand -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- already broad base of leadership in the entertainment industry,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. Analysts have suggested that <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s stock is worth between $ 14 and $ 20 a share. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is a leading producer of original television programming, but in recent years has been troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into other areas disintegrated _ sometimes causing the company to incur losses or heavy costs that depressed its earnings. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> produces such long-running TV series as `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Knots Landing,'' `` Peoples Court'' and `` Love Connection.'' It has 12 hours a week of prime-time TV programming and 16 -LCB- hours of syndicated programs. For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> posted a net loss of $ 82.6 million on revenue of $ 616.8 million. The loss included $ 45 million in writedowns on five movies and $ 22 million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video subsidiary. The company has replaced managements of both its movie and home-video units. In March, several <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company in federal court, alleging that <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> overstated its income and net worth and did not reveal problems with its home-video unit. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has been seeking to get back into the entertainment industry since he sold <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> to media tycoon <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> in 1985 for $ 575 million. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had owned <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> for four years, but the company was beset by persistent losses. Last year, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made an unsuccessful $ 321.9 million bid for the 90.6 percent he did n't already own of <ORGANIZATION> Spectradyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest supplier of cable television and pay-per-view movies for hotels.

 Stock prices were holding steady at higher levels after reports today that several major brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own accounts.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar closed lower against most major foreign currencies in quiet European trading Tuesday. Gold prices rose. Currency dealers said most activity focused on the British pound, which continued to attract investor interest because of high British interest rates. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was pushed down after its failure to rise through technical resistance levels in the past few trading sessions and by a large order to sell dollars for Swiss francs, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealers said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 124.63 Japanese yen, down from Monday's 124.87 yen. In later <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading it was quoted at 124.45 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. The pound rose to $ 1.8825 from $ 1.8790 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6783 West German marks, down from 1.6820; 1.3955 Swiss francs, down from 1.4010; 5.6905 French francs, down from 5.7075; 1.8815 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8805; 1,248.00 Italian lire, down from 1,250.00; and 1.2375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2396 Gold rose in quiet trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Tuesday, closing at a bid $ 446.50 a troy ounce in both <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> on Tuesday was added to the list of countries which may no longer borrow from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> because of overdue repayments on previous loans.

Payments from the countries on it are so far behind that the bank is no longer entering payments from them on its books until it actually receives the money. Banks sometimes list payments to them on an `` accrual'' basis just because they are due, regardless of whether the money has actually come in. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> are on this list as well as the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> list. The bank also includes <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and _ since last week _ <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The bank keeps a list of countries, not normally published, whose payments are 75 days overdue. Its practice is to suspend disbursements on loans to those countries. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank, said that at the moment its two lists are identical. The bank is the chief source of long-term aid loans to Third World countries. The fund's basic job is to keep currencies stable, often with the help of shorter-term loans. In recent years its loans too have been going almost entirely to Third World countries.

 <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has launched a $ 2.5 billion mutual fund that will invest in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasuries </ORGANIZATION> and corporate bonds, setting a record for a new fund investing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a report published Tuesday said. The Wall Street Journal, in Tuesday's editions, said the new fund could indicate that Japanese investors have revived their enthusiasm for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds. Most of the investors in the fund are Japanese financial institutions, along with some individuals. <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> officials told the Journal that the fund, called New Bond Fund 88, was opened to participation last Friday and attracted so many investors that it was oversubscribed and had to be closed on Monday. Officials of the Japanese investment firm did n't return telephone calls Tuesday seeking confirmation of the fund launch. The record amount to be invested by the <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> fund surpasses the $ 2 billion <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, the largest comparable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fund, according to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzfeld </PERSON>, a specialist in mutual funds. The <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> fund, launched in early March, also invests in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and corporate bonds. Japanese investors were likely attracted to the <LOCATION> Daiwa </LOCATION> fund by the current higher yields on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds compared with their Japanese counterparts. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasuries </ORGANIZATION> are currently yielding rates of more than 9 percent, while Japanese government and corporate bonds yield around 4 -LCB- percent. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohmura </PERSON>, an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION>, told the Journal the new fund will seek even higher yields for investors by purchasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company bonds, though it wo n't buy high-yield, high-risk corporate `` junk'' bonds. The new fund may do some buying at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly refinancing auctions being held this week, most likely in shorter-term issues, <PERSON> Ohmura </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is in a lather over foreign stake-building in some of its largest companies and is hinting at moves to block incursions into <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC and two big confectioners While the rumblings echo familiar patriotic strains, the government says its concerns are strategic, not protectionist. The BP case, for example, involves the purchase of a major stake in the company by an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member, which could put the interests of British shareholders at risk, the critics say. They argue that the foreign raids on candy makers <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> are even more of a mismatch because the raiders themselves are protected against takeover reprisals. In the BP case, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government said the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake in the oil giant warranted investigation because the Arab nation belongs to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the world's fifth largest oil producer, is not a member of the cartel. The Conservative government has referred the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether the acquisition is in the public interest, according to Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The Kuwaiti government's investment office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> maintains that its BP stake is a long-term investment, and `` considers it has always acted as a model investor in BP.'' It bought the stake piecemeal after the British government sold off its remaining 31.5 perent share of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> last fall. Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading, which advises the trade secretary on whether to call in the monopolies commission, is reviewing two Swiss companies' runs on Kit Kat-maker <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. Noting that Swiss law protects <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> S.A. from takeovers, critics object to the lack of reciprocity. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, secretary of state for trade and industry, said in response to a question in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that reciprocity would be a key issue in the review. `` The points -LRB- being -RRB- made about fairness are crucial,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Banham </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest industry group, added: `` We ca n't safely continue to play football against teams which have built brick walls against their own goals and expect to win. Swiss food giant <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> has launched a $ 2.1 billion pound -LRB- $ 3.95 billion -RRB- takeover offer for <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> and has bought an 11 percent stake in the company. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> has purchased a 29.9 percent holding in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, the maximum allowed under British takeover regulations short of a full takeover bid. Also at issue is <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of a 17.7 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The goverment said Tuesday it would not go to the monopolies commission, but warned that <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Mass.-based General Cinema could face further scrutiny if it goes ahead with plans to increase its stake. Critics complain that General <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON> also is `` bid-proof'' because some of its shareholders have limited voting rights and the state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where the company is incorporated, has passed anti-takeover legislation. Young denied the government was becoming protectionist, telling the Observer newspaper: `` If we start getting into protectionism, we will be the ones to suffer most.'' While Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is a staunch advocate of free market policies and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is an enthusiastic foreign investor, it remains generally resistant to foreign investment. `` This company is a national asset,'' former <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> told applauding shareholders at their annual meeting late last month. `` It is wrong that it should go to some inanimate place without tradition.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Maucher </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> this week to meet with members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, insisting <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> would benefit if its products were marketed through <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide sales network. Asked by <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> about the reciprocity issue, he admitted that it was `` a barrier to takeover.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderau </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> vice president, declined to comment Tuesday. The foreign suitors do have backers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Some workers at <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION> said they believed <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> offered better job security, and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> saw `` no economic justification for erecting barriers against foreign ownership of British companies. And it would be unwise to try and do so at a time when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is taking advantage of a cheap dollar to build up substantial investments across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>.'' On Tuesday, Labor party member <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> introduced a proposal which would give employees the right to consultation by their employer before a takeover. But the bill stands little chance of becoming law because of pressure on parliamentary time.

<HEAD>IMF's Camdessus Criticizes Banks For Lack Of Lending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>'s managing director criticized commercial banks Tuesday for not lending enough to Third World nations. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said developing countries needed new loans to grow out of their debts. He said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> does n't have the resources to provide such loans, and although larger commercial banks do, they have n't shown enough willingnes to extend new credit. `` The record is plain. Last year, net bank lending to countries with debt-servicing problems was negligible at best; two years before, it was negative,'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said. `` It is n't only the amount of financing that matters. It is also the timeliness of financing and the attitude of the banks in responding to the indebted countries' efforts and needs.'' He added: `` This inevitably sends the wrong signal to countries contemplating bolder efforts and it calls into question the notion that our strategy is a cooperative one oriented to growth.'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> noted that many indebted countries have made progress in adopting IMF-agreed programs, but the former governor of the French central bank said the shift toward economic reform in the developing world `` risks being interrupted, and even reversed, because of doubts concerning the availability of financial support.'' <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> programs usually involve trimming government spending and reducing the size of the public sector, loosening exchange rate and trade policy and encouraging export-led growth. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>' criticism of the conduct of commercial banks, which are carrying billions of dollars worth of possible bad debts, follows a sharper attack two weeks ago from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said the banks had taken a passive approach to debt crisis and he said that all major innovations for resolving the crisis had come from the debtor countries themselves. Commercial bankers have criticized the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and many governments for refusing to grant easier repayment terms on their own loans to developing countries, but have expected banks to take losses on their lending.

 The stock market turned lower in afternoon trading today, giving up earlier gains on news that several major brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own accounts. At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 1,995.69, down 1.66 points. Decliners outnumbered gainers by more than 7 to 6 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 784 down, 626 up, and 530 unchanged.

 Soybean futures closed sharply higher Tuesday while grain futures turned mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The rise in soybean prices indicated traders remained strongly bullish heading into a series of important <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports that were to be released after the close, analysts said. Among the reports, the most eagerly awaited figure was the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s new prediction for the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpile on Aug. 31, the end of the soybean crop year. The market was expecting the soybean number to be equal to or slightly lower than the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s last estimate of 290 million bushels. A figure lower than expected would give the soybean market impetus to move higher, analysts said. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> predicted the stockpile would total 275 million bushels. Also released after the close were the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of the 1988 winter wheat crop _ 1.62 billion bushels vs. 1.56 billion bushels produced last year _ along with supply-and-demand indications for feed grains and the first estimate of next year's grain stockpiles At the close, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.03 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $ 1.99 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.61 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.06 a bushel

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is in dismal financial condition and must get concessions from its labor unions before it can be pulled out of a financial tailspin, new <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> told shareholders Tuesday at the airline's annual meeting. A <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union leader warned, meanwhile, that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> will face a strike if no contract settlement is reached soon between the union and the airline. `` We have urgent problems to solve. We've been held in suspension pending the finalization of new -LRB- contract -RRB- arrangements with our union-represented employees,'' <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said. `` That is the first step on our road to recovery.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth-largest airline, operates <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a Northeast shuttle service and a commuter airline. <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, a former head of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> who came to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> in January as part of a major management shakeup at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, outlined his strategy to stanch financial losses in the immediate future. He called for expanding the carrier's existing transatlantic and Latin American routes and beefing up domestic routes so they feed more passengers to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s international flights. <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> stressed wage cuts and other labor concessions he said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> must get from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, the flight attendants union and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. The company has won $ 75 million in concessions from the two unions representing pilots and flight engineers, <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' contract expired Feb. 21, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has imposed terms on the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> designed to save $ 35 million annually by cutting wages 8 percent and boosting productivity. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also is asking for $ 27 million in annual savings from the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents mechanics and baggage handlers, and $ 31 million from the flight attendants. In return for the concessions, the company is offering $ 21 million in <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> stock, with an additional 15 million shares to be issued to employees if specific profit targets are reached. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> stock traded Tuesday at $ 2.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which has debts of around $ 500 million, posted a net loss of $ 262 million last year and $ 462 million in 1986. In the first quarter of this year the company reported a net loss of $ 83.3 million, narrowed from a loss of $ 93.6 million in the same period last year. <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> was sharply criticized by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the national <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union's Airline Division. At a news conference before the shareholders meeting, Genoese threatened that the Teamsters would strike the airline if a fair agreement was not signed soon. `` We can strike them at any time. We can strike them over Memorial Day or the Fourth of July,'' Genoese warned, calling the date merely a matter of organization. The Teamsters represent more than 4,000 reservations clerks and other ground personnel. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has a total of around 28,000 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> continues to lose money and will not regain its financial health until it has signed contracts with all five unions, allowing the company to borrow money to recapitalize, Genoese said.

 <ORGANIZATION> RTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s directors have approved a $ 324 takeover offer from the Houston-based electrical firm <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which outbid a rival suitor. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> will begin a $ 45-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> RTE </ORGANIZATION>'s 7.2 million outstanding shares on Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> RTE </ORGANIZATION> treasurer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also will assume outstanding RTE debt of about $ 41 million.

 The stock market closed mixed today, failing to deliver a strong positive response to news that several major brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own accounts.

 The federal courts have upheld <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s takeover law for the second time in recent weeks, further bolstering the ability of target companies to keep unwanted bidders at bay But because the judges' opinions were issued in preliminary hearings and are subject to further consideration, experts expect the law to be tested further. `` An appeal is almost guaranteed,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Dechert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>. `` This is far from being conclusive.'' A number of states have enacted anti-takeover laws in recent years, but <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s is regarded as especially significant because many of the nation's biggest companies are incorporated there. Some 45 percent of the companies listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are incorporated in the state, and 56 percent of the Fortune 500 industrial companies have opted to incorporate in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to take advantage of its liberal corporate and tax laws. On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> upheld <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s 3-month-old law as it applies to <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 1.42 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Staley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. And last month Judge <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said the law was `` most likely constitutional His ruling came in reponse to a challenge by <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a takeover company headed by British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, which is pursuing a hostile $ 1.69 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Both <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> argued that the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law is unconstitutional because, they say, it conflicts somewhat with federal laws that govern tender offers and takeovers. Two previous challenges to the statute _ involving <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was attempting to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in its bid for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ never got to the review stage. A key provision of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law bars a potential buyer from acquiring a company for three years after the buyer accumulates more than 15 percent of the target company's stock. The provision does not apply if the buyer acquires a total of 85 percent of the company's shares in the same transaction that it passes the 15 percent threshold, or if the board of directors supports the offer. The provision is aimed at `` bust-up'' deals in which a hostile buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance the buyout, and partial offers under which the buyer acquires just enough shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining shareholders a lesser price for their stock. <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s challenge was backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which filed a brief in support of the British firm's motion. Some experts say the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to formally register its opposition to the law makes <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s ruling particularly important. `` It is quite significant because it shows that a federal court in charge principally of interpreting the constitution approved a state statute under attack by ... the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crompton </PERSON>, an attorney with <ORGANIZATION> Potter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Corroon in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crompton </PERSON>, who represented both <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement was highly unusual and that the court likely would `` pay special attention to the position of a federal agency.'' But others say that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s support, filed in a friend-of-the-court brief, bolsters <ORGANIZATION> Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>'s position so much that an appeal is inevitable, even though the company has yet to announce its intentions. `` Here's a federal agency that comes in and says the law runs counter to the prinicples of the Williams Act -LRB- which governs tender offers -RRB- because it gives management too much power and therefore denies shareholders the ability to make an informed decision,'' <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> said. `` It is certain to be reviewed.'' While experts agree that the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> statute is the most comprehensive and best crafted of the state statutes, federal judges in other circuits are not bound by the rulings of district judges in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` Lawyers and interested parties and shareholders are going to be looking at what the courts of appeal do,'' <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> noted.

<HEAD>American Standard's Profit Slips 1.4 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a 1.4 percent decline in its first-quarter profit from a year earlier, due to substantial costs stemming from its fight against a $ 2.33 billion tender offer from appliance maker <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The plumbing and air-conditioning manufacturer said its first-quarter net income slipped to $ 21.3 million from $ 21.6 million in the first three months of 1987. Per-share income rose, on the other hand, to 67 cents from 65 cents as the number of outstanding <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> shares declined to around 31.5 million from 32.9 million in the same period a year ago. The decline in net income occurred despite a 15.5 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, to $ 900.8 million from $ 779.7 million a year earlier.

Traders continued to focus on the British pound because it was the only currency that did not seem to be locked into a narrow trading range. Investors have been attracted to sterling because of high British interest rates. The dollar maintained its ground after a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> auction of three-year notes proceeded about as predicted. `` It was exceptionally lackluster,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>.

At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 124.38 yen, down from 124.81 late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. The pound rose to $ 1.8825 from $ 1.8790 late Monday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.8843 from $ 1.8815 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6780 West German marks, down from 1.6815; 1.3944 Swiss francs, down from 1.4001; 1.2380 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2385; 5.6905 French francs, down from 5.7060; and 1,247.35 Italian lire, down from 1,249.50 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates: 1.6783 West German marks, down from 1.6820; 1.3955 Swiss francs, down from 1.4010; 5.6905 French francs, down from 5.7075; 1.8815 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8805; 1,248.00 Italian lire, down from 1,250.00; and 1.2375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2396. Gold closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at a bid $ 448.95 a troy ounce, up from $ 446.66 an ounce.

 Five of the biggest brokerage firms said Tuesday they had indefinitely halted a computerized trading strategy that critics blame for spasms of destructive volatility in the crash-scarred stock market.

 American companies should avoid the lure of cheap Soviet launches to send commercial payloads into space because of danger to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> told a meeting of space writers Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is launching 10 times as many spaceloads as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government wants to bridge the gap, which widened after <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commercial program came to a halt following the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. `` The Soviets are taking clever advantage of our space-launch hiatus, luring firms with their government-financed launchings,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said at the 50th <ORGANIZATION> Aviation-Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference. `` I am opposed to allowing any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm to use a Soviet launcher, regardless of whether the threat of technology transfer is posed,'' he said. The Soviets, who sent the first satellite into orbit in 1957, have launched the most satellites into space of any country. The Soviets' powerful booster rockets also can put into orbit heavier payloads than their Western competitors. In March, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it launched its first payload for a paying customer, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. A month earlier, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> firm, <ORGANIZATION> Payload </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, became the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to receive authorization to send an experiment aboard a Soviet spacecraft. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> approved a two-year agreement starting in 1989 to have Soviet cosmonauts aboard the MIR space station perform protein crystallization experiments for Payload Systems' clients. Under the 1984 Commercial Space Launch Act, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> defines and regulates commercial space efforts. In 1986, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced that the space shuttle would no longer carry commercial or foreign satellites, except for defense-related missions. The directive was designed to foster competition among private launchers, and <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said American companies have contracted to launch 14 satellites, with reservations for 17 more. Eleven of the contracts are from foreign governments or international organizations. Meantime, though, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is seeking more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payloads, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I perceive a danger to our national security in the Soviet enticement of launch contracts with their artificially low prices,'' he said. `` American companies are looking for inexpensive rides for their payloads. `` If we ever allowed the American use of Soviet launchers to become a pattern, the Soviets' already mature launch capability would be further strengthened while our launch facilities could lie rotting on the ground.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said he opposed the government's approval of Payload Systems' Soviet contract because `` paying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hard currency to help them build a launch capacity that could be used against us our allies in wartime is unwise.''

 Stock prices closed slightly higher Tuesday, little affected by news that several major brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own accounts in attempt to curb volatility and woo frightened investors back to the market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials settled at 2,003.65, up 6.30 points. Gainers edged out decliners on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 745 up, 713 down and 507 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 131.2 million shares, compared with 166.32 million on Monday. The session started off with moderate gains, after the first of what grew to five brokerages announced that they were suspending index-arbitrage trading, or had recently done so. Index arbitrage takes place when traders using computers play off differences between futures contracts and their underlying baskets of stocks. It has been criticized as causing wide swings in the market, scaring investors away and contributing to the market's recent inability to respond positively to favorable news about the economy. Analysts said the moves _ by <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ could have been sufficient to spark a strong updraft, had the will been there. But apparently, it was n't. By early afternoon, the rally was eroding away, and had turned to an overall loss with less than an hour to go. Only a last-minute spate of ordinary buy orders turned the tide, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, head of block trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If the market really had a chance to go up, this should have been a real opportunity for the bulls to shake, rattle and roll,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` But the rally was less than puny _ from minus 2 points in the Dow to 13 on the upside. `` What it says is, the overall trend is down.'' he added. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, director of technical research, at the <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> securities firm in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he belived the market was `` still floundering.'' `` It has no focal point. Most investors are very insecure. There's no confidence. The sentiment is very bearish. There's nothing there to trigger a rally,'' he said Contributing to the market's bearishness is an underlying fear of higher interest rates, brought on by recent signs of strength in the economy. Some analysts said traders were nervously watching Tuesday's start of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s three-day auction of $ 26 billion in new bonds and notes, fearing that limited Japanese participation might send rates higher amid slack demand In Tuesday's auction, yields on three-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes did rise to the highest level since November, averaging 8.23 percent, up from 7.42 percent at the last auction on Feb. 1. But <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said the performance proved to be `` no big deal'' compared to the market's underlying overall bearishness in affecting Tuesday's performance. Among most-active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 54; <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> was down -RCB- at 36 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was up -RRB- at 110 ~ <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was up -LCB- at 44 -LRB-, while <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 50 -LCB-. Among other NYSE-listed issues, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 | to 30 ~ on word that it is discussing forming an international investment firm with <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 151.72 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index was up 0.47 at 145.75. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.08 to 299.66, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was 1.08 higher at 257.62. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index fell 0.18 to 299.81. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market closed at 375.43, down 0.84. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 5.581 billion, or 0.22 percent, in value.

<HEAD>Experts Predict More Delays If No New Airports Are Built</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With airline traffic on the rise, the nation needs to build more airports, hire more traffic controllers and modernize equipment to avoid `` hellish delays,'' airline industry officials said Tuesday. `` In the heavily traveled corridors and the heavily traveled airports, the system is becoming incapable of handling the traffic,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON>, director of transportation at <ORGANIZATION> Harbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` Over the next three years I think we are going to see some hellish delays developing,'' <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said in a panel discussion at the 50th annual <ORGANIZATION> Aviation-Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference. Airline travel has been on the rise since the industry was deregulated in 1978. According to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> figures, 450 million people rode regularly scheduled commercial airline flights last year, and officials project 600 million passengers a year by the early 1990s. `` We've just got to get more capacity to handle the load,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The long-term prospects are not good unless we can significantly increase airport capacity in the country,'' he said. `` We have had explosive growth in air transportation in recent years but the capacity of the system has not grown.'' The number of public-use airports in the country fell for the 15th straight year in 1987 to 5,723 from 5,775 the previous year, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. The last major airport built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> in 1974, and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is the only city currently planning to build a new airport. Part of the problem has been local opposition to new airports because of airplane noise, air pollution and ground traffic. In some cities, residents have succeeded in forcing airports to reduce operting hours and restrict the types of airplanes permitted to land, experts said. `` Nobody wants an airport in his or her backyard,'' <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said, adding that airlines have been forced to tailor their schedules to meet local desires. Defending airlines' current on-time performance, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said 78.8 percent of flights on the 14 largest American carriers were on time in March, up from 74.7 percent a month earlier. He said consumer complaints fell 21 percent in April from the previous month and that mishandled baggage declined to 7.5 reports per 1,000 passengers in March, compared to 8.7 in February and 11.8 in January.

<BYLINE>Soybean Rally Continues; Report Suggests Even Higher Prices
^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices bounded higher for the fourth straight session Tuesday, and analysts said an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> forecast of a steep drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles would keep the rally from faltering. On other markets, grain futures were mixed; precious metals advanced; livestock, meat and energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. The May soybean contract on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has gained 21 -LCB- cents a bushel in less than a week, primarily on fears that this spring's dry weather foreshadows a hot, dry growing season. The soybean market has been particularly sensitive to weather worries since a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report last month predicted the nation's soybean stockpile would total a relatively low 290 million bushels on Aug. 31, the end of the current crop year If that prediction were correct, a poor harvest this fall could lead to tight supplies of soybeans next year. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> released a new report Tuesday afternoon, revising its 1988 soybean carryout estimate to an even lower 275 million bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also predicted a 1989 carryout of just 145 million bushels, well below market estimates of 150 million to 200 million bushels. Analysts said the numbers were bullish and futures prices likely would rise again Wednesday morning. `` I think beans will be at least a nickel and probably more towards a dime higher, and we could go higher than that,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president and soybean analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> numbers were based on farmer surveys conducted before planting even began. Soybean futures prices have risen more than 50 cents a bushel since the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s March 31 planting intentions report, and Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said the higher prices probably persuaded farmers to plant more soybeans. `` The odds are that soybean acreage will be higher and -LRB- next year's -RRB- soybean ending stocks will also be higher,'' she said. <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> agreed, but still predicted soybean futures prices would rise sharply on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also estimated the 1988 winter wheat harvest at 1.62 billion bushels, up 4 percent from last year's harvest and well above the average market estimate of 1.58 billion bushels. The agency predicted a sharp drop in wheat stockpiles, however, which could offset the negative market impact of the high yield estimate. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the 1988 corn carryout at 4.11 billion bushels and the 1989 corn carryout at 3.39 billion bushels, which analysts termed neutral for corn futures. In trading Tuesday, wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.03 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.99 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents to 3 \ cents higher with Mayat $ 1.61 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 5 -RCB- cents to 7 cents higher with May at $ 7.05 -RCB- a Silver futures led the precious metals complex higher in what analysts described as follow-through buying after Monday's strong finish. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled $ 2.80 to $ 4 higher with June at $ 451.60 a troy ounce; silver was 10 cents to 11.2 cents higher with May at $ 6.57 a troy ounce. Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle's performance suggested early positioning ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s next cattle-on-feed report, which is due out on Monday, analysts said. Gains in the pork markets linked to steady cash hog prices were limited by a softening wholesale pork market, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle settled .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June unchanged at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower to .15 cent higher with May at 80.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 51.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .23 cent lower to .38 cent higher with May at 51.32 cents a pound Oil prices finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a second day of featureless trading. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 8 cents higher with June at $ 17.46 a barrel; heating oil was .04 cent lower to .16 cent higher with June at 47.74 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .12 cent higher with June at 51.62 cents a gallon.

 Loss-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 1.18 billion stock-swap deal that adds a top television producer to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s movie-and-music empire. A merger between the two entertainment companies had been widely expected, since they have been engaged in on-again-off-again merger talks since early March. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> produces such popular network television series as `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Knots Landing'' and `` <PERSON> Alf </PERSON>,'' as well as a strong lineup of shows that are syndicated, or sold directly to individual stations. Equally important, analysts said, are <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s expected revenues from future syndication of shows it has produced. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> produces such prime-time series as `` Night Court'' and `` Spenser for Hire,'' but is stronger in the movie and record businesses. `` We saw a terriffic fit,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON>, who would retain day-to-day control for the time being. `` I think there's a tremendous upside in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock for our shareholders.'' The agreement, expected to close in September, calls for 0.415 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> common shares to be exchanged for each <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> common share. The deal puts a value of about $ 14 on each of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>'s 47 million outstanding common shares, for a total of around $ 630 million. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would assume <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s debt of about $ 550 million. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> retains the right to walk away if the merger does n't bring its stockholders at least $ 15 per share, which means <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price must average $ 36 per In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents a share to close at $ 32.87 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> fell 37 -LCB- cents to close at $ 12.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Among other conditions attached to the deal, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> would be required to pay <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> $ 10 million if the deal is canceled. If <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> accepts a higher offer from another party, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would have an option to buy 18.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> for $ 15 a share. Though long a television powerhouse, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> in recent years has been troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into movies and home-videos disintegrated _ sometimes causing the company to incur losses or heavy costs that depressed its earnings. For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> posted a net loss of $ 82.6 million on revenue of $ 616.8 million. The loss included $ 45 million in writedowns on five movies and $ 22 million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video subsidiary. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> earlier rejected a $ 770 million, or $ 17-a-share, takeover bid from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the former owner of <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has indicated he may be willing to go higher, could not be reached for comment Tuesday But <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON> dismissed speculation that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> might sweeten his bid, saying <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> had never been interested in a merger other than the stock swap negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. `` The acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> ... will expand -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- already broad base of leadership in the entertainment industry,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. The merger would team two high-profile show business executives in <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON>, who is married to television interviewer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. `` Steve and I have known each other for a long time and we see eye-to-eye on most things,'' <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON> said. `` We both see ourselves as entrepreneurial human beings. The Lorimar name, staff and <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> headquarters will be retained for television production, said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, but he declined to discuss the future of <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s movie or home-video units. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> produces 12 hours of weekly prime-time TV programming and 16 -LCB- hours of syndicated programs; while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> produces five hours a week of network shows. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> also owns the former <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> movie lot in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which reportedly is worth as much as $ 200 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a high-resolution still-video camera priced at about $ 20,000 at its annual stockholders' meeting Tuesday. Meanwhile, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, president of the Cambridge-based company, told shareholders that despite the growth in electronic screen images, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> believes that print photography `` will grow dramatically in the foreseeable future.'' `` Our strategy is to commit to instant hard copy based on our firm belief that electronic imaging is not going to drive out hard copy,'' <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said. `` Rather, it is going to be the driving force for more instant hard copies than ever before.'' <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the new video camera brings high-resolution still imaging capabilities to video monitoring, recording and transmission.

The equity committee is waging a proxy contest with management for control of the board of directors. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Bow </PERSON> said a preliminary analysis of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> shows he could offer a plan that would make stock in the company worth more than its present market value. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, excluding the dissidents' nominees, on Tuesday urged shareholders to oppose the dissidents' attempt to solicit proxies to elect a majority of the board at the annual shareholders meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said previously that while it did not start the proxy fight it intended to win. The contest could be decided at a May 20 shareholders meeting, although unsecured creditors have asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> to cancel the meeting. Management, in resisting the preferred shareholders, cited record sales and earnings in its on-going consumer products businesses during the six months ended March 27.

<HEAD>Directors Won't Consider New Offer, Oppose Sugarman's Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that its board of directors would not consider a sweetened $ 2 billion takeover bid from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Burg </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>. The company also urged shareholders to spurn <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s efforts to have himself, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotterer </PERSON>, vice chairman of two <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> companies, elected to <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s 10-member board through a proxy fight. The company's annual meeting is set for May 20. In a letter to shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said, `` Our commitment is to the best interest of our shareholder. We do n't believe those interests are at all served by the likes of Messrs. Sugar, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gotterer </PERSON> as represented by their statements and past actions. `` We vigorously oppose their election to the company's board.'' Media General had said Monday the board would review <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s sweetened $ 70-a-share cash bid, but he noted the company's major shareholder, the family of Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, remained opposed to the proposal <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> originally offered $ 61.50 a share, or around $ 1.6 billion. The <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family owns 71 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s 559,168 Class B shares, while <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> controls 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s 28 million Class A shares. Like several media companies, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> has two classes of stock to keep control of the company in the hands of a few. While there are fewer Class B shares outstanding, those shares are more powerful than the Class A shares. Two weeks ago, U.S District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> ruled <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s original offer would have to be approved by two-thirds of each class of stockholders, who must vote separately. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s attorney, who promised to appeal, had argued that Media General's charter allowed a simple majority decision by a combined vote of shareholders representing the company's two classes of stock. Media General attorneys successfully contended that voting provision applied to acquisitions made by <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, not to a concern trying to acquire it. Media General is the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, publishers of the Richmond-Times Dispatch and The Richmond News-Leader. The company also holds other newspaper interests and owns several television stations. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is chairman of the California-based <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which produces `` The Dating Game'' and other popular television game shows and the South Carolina-based <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a cement company.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s assembly plant, which builds the new Ford Probe and the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX-6, nearly has finished hiring and has begun training workers for the second shift, company officials said Tuesday. When the second shift begins production in June, the $ 550 million plant will employ nearly 3,000 assembly and 400 salaried workers, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. The plant began building cars in September. By August, when it reaches full production, the plant will be completing 240,000 cars a year. More than 60 percent of them will be Probes built for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to be sold through the Ford Division. But until then, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,500 dealers will have to settle for a small trickle of the sporty two-door hatchbacks, which they say are in such demand they are moving at premium prices. Probe's official introduction is Thursday as a 1989 model, but dealers have had them for several months. Ford Division General Manager <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said the plant's Probe production is sold out through October. `` Whatever we get we sell immediately. We ca n't keep them,'' said <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Troy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a good buy, it's sporty, well-priced, economical to drive. What more can you ask? Since February people have been coming in asking for Probe.'' Unfortunately, <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> said, she does n't get many. The first one was sold as soon as she got it, so she had to convince the buyer to let her keep it in the showroom for four weeks so other customers could see it. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Blackwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, said customers are paying over-sticker prices to get the Ford-designed cars which have been engineered and built by <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. Both dealers said the front-wheel-drive Probe fills a void in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s lineup and will not replace the popular rear-wheel-drive Mustang. Elder and <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> were among several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dealer council who toured the high-tech <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> plant on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> owns 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and the plant sits on the site of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s defunct <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Casting facility. The highly automated factory includes the final assembly plant, plastics shop, paint shop and metal-stamping plant. It uses robots throughout, even to perform tasks such as putting the spare tire in the trunk. It also boasts some ideas not found in other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants, such as a hanging conveyor tilted at a 30-degree angle, making it easier for workers to attach parts to the cars' underbodies Probe comes in three versions. Standard equipment on all includes a 2.2-liter engine with 12 valves, four cylinders and fuel-injection, four-wheel independent suspension, power rack-and-pinion steering and power front-disc brakes and retractable headlights. The base Probe GL starts at $ 10,711. The Probe LX starts at $ 11,695 and the Probe GT starts at $ 13,845. All prices including transportation and handling charges.

<TEXT>
 The panel of experts created to solve the government's budget woes convened for its first public meeting Tuesday with a pledge that it would finish its work ahead of schedule. But many members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> quickly realized it will be no easy task to master the arcane details of federal budget writing. Former Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, now head of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the co-chairmen of the 12-member commission, both said the panel was committed to solving the budget problem in a bipartisan way after considering all possible solutions. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> announced that the panel in an earlier closed-door session had agreed to an accelerated schedule under which its recommendations would be completed and released on Dec. 21, more than two months ahead of the deadline called for by law. Both <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> previously had indicated that the March 1, 1989, deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the commission's final report would be too late to influence the next president's critical first budget request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which he traditionally makes soon after taking office in January. At the first meeting, witnesses explained how the budget process was supposed to work, but some members of the panel had trouble following the technical language. In opening remarks, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the commission was united in its belief that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not continue to outspend its income if we want to continue this nation's dominant position in the world.'' `` What we require in dealing with this problem is some true statesmanship _ a placing of the common good above all others,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` We owe that to the generations that will follow us. Our children and grandchildren have a right to live and work in an environment that will not be subject to periodic, unpredictable economic jolts.'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said the commission would be involved in an educational process over the next six months, trying to establish `` a common factual base from which we can make informed decisions.'' Among the witnesses who testified Tuesday was <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Collender </PERSON>, director of federal budget policy for the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Collender </PERSON> urged the commission to scrap the current deficit targets set in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law <PERSON> Collender </PERSON> said the average $ 36 billion per year reduction in the budget deficit, which last year totaled $ 151.4 billion, were `` phony, more of a publicity stunt than a serious deficit maximum.'' He said that reaching a balanced budget by 1993, as called for under the current law, was very doubtful. He said yearly deficit reductions of between $ 15 billion and $ 20 billion would be more realistic. The commission's 12 members were appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Another two members will be added by the president-elect after the Nov. 8 election. Then if things go according to plan, the deal-making will start in earnest, with the decisions forming the basis for the new president's first budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Supporters of the expert panel approach believe that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, protected by the political cover from the commission, will swallow hard and vote to cut popular programs and raise enough taxes to finally solve the deficit problem. `` Everyone for years has known the solution to the deficit problem: You either raise taxes or you cut spending,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the business school at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the commission provides the mechanism for doing the hard things that have to be done, but allows members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as individuals to duck the blame, then it might work.'' The White House predicts the budget deficit for fiscal 1988 will be $ 146.7 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, however, estimates it will be about $ 157 billion. The national debt currently is about $ 2.5 trillion.
