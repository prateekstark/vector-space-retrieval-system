 Hurricane Erin continued its northward trek into cooler mid-Atlantic waters Friday with winds falling to 85 mph and forecasters predicting a gradual weakening over the weekend. `` It's only a threat to marine interests,'' said National Hurricane Center forecaster <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimberlain </PERSON>. `` Our forecast track is between <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' At 10:30 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s center was near 43.0 north latitude and 35.4 west longitude, or about 310 miles west-northwest of the westernmost <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>. The system was moving northeast at about 25 mph and was expected to weaken gradually over the next 24 hours.

<TEXT>
 The wife and son of `` Starsky and Hutch'' star <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> are infected with the virus which causes AIDS, and the couple's daughter has already died from the disease. Although <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> and her 5-year-old son have not developed AIDS, the couple's first child, daughter <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON>, died of AIDS complications last year at age 7. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON>, the former star of the cop show `` Starsky and <PERSON> Hutch </PERSON>,'' is the only family member not infected. `` Lesser men would have walked,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON>, who has taken the anti-AIDS drug AZT for the past 18 months. `` He never made us feel we were anything but a family.'' <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> said the family had no choice. `` We have grown up a hell of a lot. It was either grow up or perish,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Glasers </ORGANIZATION> have strived to keep their family life as normal as possible, but they anticipate that will change, they told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in a story in Friday's editions. They said they decided to go public with their pain after they learned the National Enquirer was planning a story on them. The tabloid declined to comment. `` We begged them not to run the story but they said it was newsworthy,'' said <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON>, who is now a film director. `` Our fear is the greatest for our son,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> said. `` It is our right to tell him when he is strong enough and old enough to handle the information. Now, we may not have that choice.'' <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON>, who played the streetwise plainclothes detective <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Starsky </PERSON> in the police action series that ran from September 1975 to August 1979, acknowledged it is not easy for him to talk about the tragedy he faces. `` This has to be a story about how we rise above our fears, how we all have to be stronger than we ever thought we could be,'' he said. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON>'s former co-star <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Soul </PERSON> said he had been unaware of the family's situation and encouraged the public to support the <ORGANIZATION> Glasers </ORGANIZATION> by helping to fight the deadly disease. `` I have been deeply saddened to learn of the events of these past several years and of the profound loss which <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> have suffered,'' Soul said. `` But I am also inspired by the strength of their commitment to each other and to their children.'' The family's nightmare began in 1981 when Mrs. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> contracted HIV after receiving seven pints of blood. She had been rushed to a hospital for the transfusions when she began hemorrhaging in her ninth month of carrying Ariel. Four years later, her daughter was hospitalized with a stubborn illness. Tests confirmed it was AIDS. The <ORGANIZATION> Glasers </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> contracted the virus from her mother through eight months of breastfeeding. The boy contracted it in the womb. After her daughter's death last year, Mrs. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON>, former exhibit director for the local Children's Museum, turned much of her attention to raising money for pediatric AIDS research. She has collected more than $ 5 million. Her efforts have drawn the support of many celebrities and politicians including former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. Her story also moved <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the wife of the former Democratic presidential candidate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. `` Nobody in that short of time has touched me so,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I have never been with anybody who could rise above their own pain to help so many other people.'' As of Aug. 1, AIDS had been diagnosed in 102,621 Americans, of whom more than half, or 59,391, have died, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, which damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. It is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, transfusions of infected blood or blood products, or from an infected mother to her baby before or during birth. However, screening procedures not available when Mrs. <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> had her transfusions have greatly reduced the risk of acquiring the virus through tainted blood.

<HEAD>Abbreviated Test Flight Blamed On Defective Part</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The second test flight of the B-2 stealth bomber was scrubbed in midflight because of a crack in a part provided by a defense contractor once fined for billing fraud, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. A hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive, which powers the $ 530 million high-tech jet's generators and controls, caused oil pressure to drop during the Aug. 16 test flight, Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It was n't anything critical that would have caused the plane to crash,'' she said. `` It was a minor problem.'' The flight of the bat-wing bomber designed to pass through enemy radar undetected was scheduled to last up to four hours, but was halted after about one hour. The casing for the aircraft's No. 1 accessory drive was made by <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials indefinitely suspended last year from doing business with the government. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 115 million in October for overcharging the government for parts, billing the Pentagon for baby-sitting costs, country club dues and executive servants. The suspension did not affect contracts the company already had, including the one for the B-2 casings. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said he would not comment on the flaw. The part was redesigned to make it thicker after laboratory tests indicated the casing would work better if strengthened, Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. `` There's absolutely nothing wrong with the part as originally designed,'' she said. `` Things break, OK?'' Officials for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which builds the B-2, said the thinner casings, measuring four feet long, one foot wide and five inches thick, were examined and cleared as airworthy. `` We would n't put anything in there that we thought was potentially defective,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> engineers continue to work with designers from <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> and other subcontractors throughout the B-2 construction process and were fully aware of the modifications made to thicken the casing, Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> both said they were unaware of any plan to replace the thinner parts before the B-2's next test flight. The government has spent about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has balked at the thought of paying more than $ 500 million apiece for 132 bombers. Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> last month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants $ 4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year, and it may need $ 8 billion in each of the three years of peak production, 1992 to 1994.

 A state appeals court ruled Friday that five <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> public schools at the heart of a fierce dispute over budget-cutting can be closed. Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the five schools will be closed as planned and affected parents will receive new school assignments for their children. On July 25, the city's school committee voted to close the schools to meet Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s $ 362 million target budget and to ease a projected $ 2.6 million deficit going into the school year. The three-judge <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel ruled that the school committee's vote was valid, even though it erred when a required public hearing was delayed until Aug. 7. Parents who had fought the closings said they did not expect to appeal Friday's decision, which overturned a <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> Superior Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roseman </PERSON>'s decision Tuesday to block the closing plan. <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON> said he preferred saving money by closing the schools rather than putting special programs like athletics `` on the chopping block.'' `` I would rather close buildings than programs,'' said <PERSON> Cappucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the committee has made $ 3 million in administrative staff cuts.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s second sweep of drug users and dealers netted more than 1,400 arrests by Friday evening as authorities combined reverse sting and `` Trojan Horse'' operations with search warrants and highway surveillance. `` I think the idea is to just get as much crack off the street as we can, and to once again send a message to people that are buying and selling crack that it's not going to be tolerated,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljedal </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's office. By 11:00 p.m. Friday, the roundup produced 6,683 crack cocaine rocks, 2.6 pounds of cocaine powder, 10.44 pounds of marijuana, 52 firearms, 209 vehicles and $ 54,667 in cash. A total of 1,465 arrests had been made by Friday evening in the operation, staffed by an estimated 1,200 officers in all of the state's 67 counties. The 48-hour crackdown, dubbed Operation Rock Pile II, was launched at 12:01 a.m. Thursday and was coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A total of 2,076 arrests were made in the first Operation Rock Pile, begun June 31. It also netted 3,510 crack cocaine rocks, 10 pounds of cocaine powder, 3 pounds of marijuana, 327 vehicles, 50 firearms and $ 55,107 cash. Crack, a derivative of cocaine, is sold in small chunks called rocks. `` The only thing that surprised us intially was what seemed to be an unsually high amount of marijuana,'' <PERSON> Liljedal </PERSON> said at the operation's command post in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. In reverse stings, officers pose as drug sellers and bust customers. In Trojan Horse operations, several deputies ride hidden in the back of a truck and jump out to make arrests when the driver is offered crack for sale by street corner dealers. `` Nothing seems to deter these people when they're looking for crack or looking to sell it,'' said <PERSON> Liljedal </PERSON>.

 A 10-year-old boy pleaded innocent Friday to adult charges of criminal homicide in the March shooting of a 7-year-old girl who was riding a snowmobile in a lot adjacent to his home. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocher </PERSON> was 9 years old when, police said, he loaded his father's .35 - caliber rifle, pointed it out his parent's bedroom window and shot <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> in the He has been free on $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> stood silently next to his attorney as Monroe County Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vican </PERSON>, addressing the boy as `` Mr. <PERSON> Kocher </PERSON>,'' explained the charges of criminal homicide, aggravated assault and recklessly endangerment. Defense attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> signed documents indicating <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s plea while the boy looked on, and told the judge he had instructed the boy to stay quiet. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> stood before the judge with his arms folded, occasionally looking at the ceiling and let out a heavy sigh as he turned to his parents after the proceedings ended. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> was riding on the back of a snowmobile March 6 in <LOCATION> Kresgeville </LOCATION> with her friend and <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s next-door neighbor, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON>, 13, when she was shot. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> was arrested two days later after police found the rifle with a telescopic sight, a cut on the boy's forehead and blood splattered in the room. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said the rifle cut him when its recoil jammed the scope's eyepiece into his face. In June, <PERSON> Vican </PERSON> refused to transfer <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s case to juvenile court, saying the shooting was deliberate. <PERSON> Vican </PERSON>'s decision followed four days of testimony from psychologists hired by the Kochers and the state. <PERSON> Vican </PERSON> wrote in June that all four psychotherapists who examined <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> agreed he did not have any mental or emotional problems at the time of the shooting. The psychologists disagreed, however, on whether <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> could understand the proceedings and participate in his defense. The also disagreed on whether he could form the intent to kill. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> faced a pre-arraignment shortly after his arrest in March, when bail was set at $ 50,000. He has been free on bond since then. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazuhanich </PERSON> said in an interview he has ruled out seeking the death penalty. He said if the boy is convicted, punishment could range from probation in conjunction with psychiatric treatment, to life imprisonment. The defense has 30 days to file pre-trial motions.

<TEXT>
 `` Why waltz when you can rock' n' roll?'' wrote a visitor in the guest book at the medieval-style castle of reputed cocaine trafficker <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>. The question reflects the fast-lane philosophy obviously embraced by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s wealthy drug lords, and was revealed in the public confiscation of hundreds of their properties nationwide in an anti-narcotics crackdown. The sandstone castle, ringed by formal gardens, dominates a 200-acre compound of 10 buildings, a dozen thoroughbred horses as well as goats, ducks, dogs and even a couple of flamingos. Visible from a nearby highway, it has long been a landmark in <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION>, a suburb 13 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. It was seized by the army this week, and shown off to reporters on Friday. European and Oriential antiques filled the castle's richly appointed rooms, lined with paintings, statues and ceramic figurines. Beds were framed with crystal and bronze, or four towering posters with marble bedside tables filled with electronics to open and shut doors and control video equipment. A guest book provided a peek at the peculiar variety of people who visited the estate. It is just one of many believed to have been owned by <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, even though he is considered a kind of second-string smuggler, lacking the household-name stature of reputed cartel bosses such as <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. The visitor who endorsed rock' n' roll signed his message, apparently in jest, `` M-19 power.'' M-19 is the name accorded to a leftist guerrilla group operating in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, although the traffickers are much more closely associated with right-wing death squads. Another visitor, calling himself <PERSON> Mad </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, wrote: `` Living by chance, loving by choice and killing by profession.'' An Oct. 10, 1988, visitor named <PERSON> Tuti </PERSON> wrote in a feminine hand: `` Happy birthday. Tomorrow they'll kill me and it'll be your fault.'' Many women left their phone numbers after their signatures. <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, identified by army officials on the estate as <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>'s sister, was much more solemn: `` May God and the Virgin bless all of this and those who inhabit it.'' The book also was signed by two men who identified themselves as local police station commanders, two army lieutenants and an army captain. Two local mayors also signed, one of them declaring, `` Few people can truly appreciate the history of this property.'' A group of women from several embassies, including <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> signed the book, as did a tour from a religious society. Next door to the estate is a religious boarding school run by nuns. In a garage and sprawling servants' quarters attached to the castle were two new Mercedes automobiles, also confiscated. There were also stables, where an office wall was lined with ribbons and trophies; an indoor swimming pool and gym, tennis courts, horse exercise trails and a modern thatch-roofed cottage of many rooms. There was a chapel as well, dedicated to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>, with stained glass windows, antique religious statues and pews for about 30 people. Studiously ignoring the dozens of soldiers who guarded the place were 10 groundskeepers who watered the well-kept lawns and acres of gardens, trimmed the hundreds of yards of hedges and tended to the animals. They gave contradicting statements about <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>: he never came to stay, he came regularly, he just left a couple of weeks ago. They all agreed on one thing: they were underpaid, receiving the minimum legal wage _ about $ 80 a month.

 The hospitality extended for 40 years by this haven for Soviet bloc refugees is being strained as more East Europeans take advantage of reforms and emigrate to the West. While East Germans flooding across the Austro-Hungarian border this summer have enjoyed heartfelt welcomes, other East European refugees find state support withering away. Women in the border town of <LOCATION> Moerbisch </LOCATION> have spent days sorting old clothes, cooking and giving hugs to exhausted East Germans who stumble in after a grueling journey to freedom through the borderland brush. `` You just have to help. Anyone with a sense of humanity has to,'' said one woman, her eyes filling with tears as she surveyed the large hall where tables were piled high with clothes and dazed East Germans sat over sausages and bread. `` I remember in 1956, my husband drove down to the border day and night with his truck to pick up the refugees,'' she said on condition of anonymity, recalling the mass exodus of Hungarians after Soviet tanks crushed <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s anti-Stalinist uprising. In 1968, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> sheltered streams of Czechoslovaks after other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms. And when martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981, at least 35,000 Poles sought asylum here. <PERSON> Ilse </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremmel </PERSON>, chief organizer of <PERSON> Moerbisch </PERSON>'s relief program, is full of energy, seeing that volunteers get rest and giving a mother's firm hug to a 17-year-old boy who left his childhood and his parents on the other side of the East-West divide. `` The help has come from everywhere,'' she says. `` Private individuals, companies, stores. Everyone is helping.'' The East Germans spend only days in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But thousands of Poles and Hungarians want to remain, and because of that they feel less welcome. Their asylum applications now are rejected on grounds they are not politically persecuted but seek only to improve their economic situation. Refugee <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojzer </PERSON> does n't see the distinction. `` You ca n't separate the two,'' he says `` If the -LRB- communist -RRB- party regulates everything, then you ca n't live or work freely.'' Many Austrians believe the Hungarians and Poles sponge off the state, receiving free room and board plus meager monthly allowances while they wait years for applications to be processed. But in July and August, 3,800 Hungarians and Poles stopped receiving the allowances and were turned out of government-rented hotels and boarding houses. They came to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> before May 1988, when the Austrian government began rejecting most asylum applications. Interior Minister <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeschnak </PERSON>, under fire from left-wingers who argue this violates <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s policy of sheltering all refugees, insisted the Poles and Hungarians were informed months in advance. But many said they were given only days' notice. About 800 jobs and language training for some Poles and Hungarians was arranged to end the furor. But <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and the West in general, still faces the dilemma of absorbing tens of thousands of East Europeans expected to cross increasingly open borders. <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> Strobl </PERSON>, a leader of the small opposition Green-Alternative party, noted that 10 percent of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s population of 7.4 million are former refugees. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s declining population should encourage authorities to integrate new arrivals who are anxious to work, he said. Two million refugees have come here since World War II ended and 613,000 remain, officials say. Last year, 16,000 applications for asylum were submitted, double the number for 1986.

 A man described by police as a drug dealer was arrested for investigation of murder in the death of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, but claimed self-defense in killing the Black Panther founder, police said Friday. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> was arrested on a weapons charge around 7 p.m. Tuesday, hours after <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s predawn murder on a west <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> sidewalk, and Investigators believe they recovered the 9mm pistol used in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>'s killing, police said, but ballistics tests are still pending. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> `` considered the murder a means to advance'' in the Black Guerrilla Family, a narcotics distribution gang, said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> at a early evening news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. `` He wanted to be a high-mucky-muck,'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said later in an interview. `` He was a foot soldier and he wanted to be a shot caller. He figured we already knew. We felt we had him and he new it.'' The Black Guerrilla Family is a prison-based gang that operates in the state's maximum-security prisons, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> served time, authorities said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, currently on parole for a robbery conviction, admitted to the killing early Friday and is scheduled for arraignment Tuesday, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> have known each other for two years. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> argued with <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> over a cocaine deal and that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> then shot the 47-year-old former leader of the black militancy movement in the 1960s. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> pulled a gun when the two met at a street corner in the drug-torn neighborhood, but investigators said they found no evidence <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> had been armed. The killing occurred in a neighborhood where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, as minister of defense for the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>, once tried to set up social programs to help destitue blacks. Police said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told them <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> demanded drugs and that he refused to sell them to him. Police said the two argued for about a minute. Police said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> had `` crossed'' the Black Guerilla Family several times in the past. Investigators believe <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> stole drugs from the gang, including an instance earlier this summer when, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, he was robbed by <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> of 14 crack cocaine rocks valued at $ 160. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said a man accompanying <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> witnessed the shooting, but police did not divulge whether the man, arrested Friday for investigation of auto theft, backed up <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s claim of self-defense. Police said they had located several other witnesses who disputed <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s account of the killing. There have been no other arrests in the case, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday for investigation of felony possession of a firearm about a block from the crime scene. He was questioned about <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s murder, but was not considered a prime suspect until Thursday. Two other men were arrested at the same time on weapons violations, but are not considered suspects in the case, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. Police denied a report published Thursday that three men had been linked to the killing, but acknowledged for the first time that the men were arrested on weapons charges one block from where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was slain about 12 hours earlier. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s slaying prompted a noontime protest march Friday that started in the neighborhood where he was slain. About 40 members of <ORGANIZATION> Uhuru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> waved banners, carried placards with his photo and chanted, `` Who killed <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>? Do n't you tell no lie, it was the government, the government, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> infiltration of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had contributed to its gradual disintegration as the group, founded more than 20 years ago, drifted from operating ghetto social programs into violence and its members were killed. Officials in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office did not immediately return a telephone message Friday afternoon. The protesters marched two miles to City Hall and the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, where supporters had chanted `` Free Huey'' during <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>'s 1968 trial for the death of an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police officer. Marchers refused to speak to reporters, blaming them for media accounts that included descriptions of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> as a gangster. Family members continued to prepare for <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s funeral Monday in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Organizers expect up to 2,000 mourners, including Black Panther co-founder <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>. `` This is for members of the community and Panthers and neighborhood supporters,'' said <PERSON> Barbarette </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, the victim's sister-in-law `` People who knew <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> in the past and present need to express some things.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to congratulate Voyager scientists and underscore his new interest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program `` I am exceedingly delighted to be here on this very historic day for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a receptive crowd of perhaps 1,000 laboratory employees. The crowd cheered as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that unmanned missions _ the <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>'s specialty _ will continue to be an important part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program. `` We are seeing a beginning of a new era where we'll see a recommitment to space,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, echoing comments he has made in recent months as he works hard to adopt the space program as his issue. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit Friday morning followed Voyager 2's close encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> that capped a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile flight that took the two Voyager spacecraft to Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and 1981, and Uranus in 1986. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who had shown little interest in the space program before becoming vice president, has now seized upon it as an issue he can use to improve his political fortunes. `` It's a great opportunity for him, because ordinarily vice presidents have limited duties,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary The issue was handed to <LOCATION> Quayle </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which established the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and designated the vice president as its head. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is hoping to convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public that expenditures on space are worthwhile, even in the face of continuing federal budget deficits. On July 20, the 20-year anniversary of the landing of a man on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the permanent settlement of space, by first returning to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and then sending a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, with developing a plan to carry out those goals.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, appealing to other nations to rally behind Colombian officials `` on the front line of the war against drugs,'' is sending President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government a $ 65 million package to combat narcotics trafficking The aid announced Friday by the summer <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consists primarily of aircraft _ mostly helicopters _ and a variety of other equipment and supplies, but no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. However, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers would be sent to show Colombians how to use and maintain the equipment. He said they would number fewer than `` dozens'' but did not have a precise figure. `` We will provide only material support and training,'' the vacationing president said in a statement. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complete confidence in the capability of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> police and military to deal with this situation. `` It is time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries of the world to stand with President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> during his courageous challenge to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric of Colombian society.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed `` to assist the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials who are on the front line of the war against drugs.'' <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has been rocked by recent drug-related violence, including the assassination last week of the leading presidential candidate and this week's bombings of homes and offices of government and political leaders. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said eight <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> transport helicopters would be sent to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> next week, and another 12 would be sent later along with a <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopter for medical evacuation. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5 transport plane brought in two Bell 212 helicopters Friday that were delivered to Colombian authorities. The helicopters, which add to six of the same type Colombian police already had, represent `` an immediate, tangible response of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s stepped-up war on the narcotics traffic,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the eight Hueys would be used mainly `` for carrying troops and policemen into rural areas'' and for locating drug activity. In addition, another 20 helicopters previously bought by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and not part of the new package, will also be shipped over the next few months, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The package includes another $ 8.6 million for light aircraft, but the type and number has yet to be determined, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Also in the package are machine guns and other small arms, grenade launchers, mortars, aircraft ammunition, radios, jeeps, ambulances, field gear, anti-tank weapons, field trucks, utility boats, 18-man `` assault boats'' that carry machine guns, medical supplies, tools and spare parts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement reiterated the administration's vow to work with Colombian legal officials in extraditing drug traffickers wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the overall package `` represents a conclusion that we have a responsibility and an interest in helping them to the maximum degree possible.'' The aircraft and supplies will help <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> `` launch a major effort'' against the drug cartel, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The money comes from a special foreign aid fund and is separate from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new $ 8 billion anti-drug program to be unveiled by the president in a nationally televised address Sept. 5. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the drug at plan will also contain additional funds for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and other Latin American countries. The money is also separate from a $ 2 million program announced earlier in the week to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> set up security for public officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with Cabinet members involved in drug policy and drug-policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> here next week. The president is midway through a three-week vacation that runs through Labor Day. Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was spending the weekend with the first family. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday followed what has been his usual pattern of athletic activities, including golf, boating and horseshoes. At one point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran his 28-foot speedboat, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, into a hard submerged object _ either a rock or piece of wood _ forcing him to abandon a morning of boating. However, the mishap, which damaged the housing of one of his propellers, was quickly repaired by a local marina and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was back on the water by late afternoon.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is beginning to draw up guidelines to market a female condom, which its manufacturer says can help protect women from the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> member of the panel that heard testimony on the device Friday, estimated that it will take <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at least 18 months to conduct the study, receive <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval and market the female condom. `` It will take us quite a while to just get the study going,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, company said after the hearing. `` The results -LRB- of the hearing -RRB- are about as good as we could expect.'' <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON>, in a presentation at the hearing, said the female condom is the only method that a woman can herself control to protect against infection from the AIDS virus and from other sexually transmitted diseases. `` Today, if a woman asks a man to wear the male condom and he says no, her choices are to take the risk or to get out of bed,'' <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> told the panel. `` A difficult decision in the heat of the moment.'' The device displayed by <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> resembled a sock made of polyurethane, a tough, clear, flexible plastic. There are soft, flexible rings at both ends. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said the ring at the closed end is to aid insertion. When properly used, she said, a sheath barrier is created within the vagina. The ring at the open end of the device remains outside and protects the labia. The female condom would cost about $ 1.50, <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said, and is designed for one use. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Pharmacal proposed to market the condom solely as a device to protect against the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. But the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel decided that before receiving approval such a barrier device should be tested on an unspecified number of women for long enough to prove that it is at least as effective as the male condom as a contraceptive. The panel concluded that there was no ethical way to test the female condom for its ability to protect against disease, but that investigating how well it prevents pregnancy would act as a `` surrogate'' test for how well it prevents disease. Requiring tests against disease directly is unethical, the panel said, because it would require exposing some women to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Proposed guidelines were revised during the hearing and panel chairwoman Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> staff will draw up formal regulations. <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said the advisory panel would meet again to consider the final guidelines, but she said no date has been set. In her presentation, <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> asked that the condom be approved for marketing only as a disease-prevention device, and medical experts from <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and from private medical organizations spoke in favor of this approach. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said the female condom, which the company is calling WPC-333, has been successfully tested on research equipment at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> and is less likely to fail than the male condom.

<HEAD>US Equipment Suited For Colombia's Drug War</HEAD>

 The helicopters, weapons and supplies the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military is providing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> will help that nation take its anti-drug battle into the remote regions where drug traffickers hide. `` Our military equipment is well-suited for that purpose. It is durable and designed to operate in rough terrain,'' Army Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Super </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Friday. While the exact numbers and types of equipment have not been completely worked out, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided to send some $ 65 million worth of material to help stem the flow of illegal drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> battle drug dealers. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat personnel will be sent to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, officials stressed, but a small number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers will train Colombians in the use of the equipment. There are 112 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, including 36 military personnel, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The initial $ 20 million package <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has designated for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> includes some of the rough-and-tumble type of equipment that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces used in the jungles of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, such as the eight UH-1 `` Huey'' troop transport helicopters. The choppers, which also may be used for ground surveillance, can be modified to carry two .50 - caliber machine `` They are fast, versatile and reliable, and can be used to great effect to speed up transportation when the roads are bad,'' <PERSON> Super </PERSON> said of the choppers. Under past Foreign Military Sales agreements, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sold <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huey </ORGANIZATION> choppers, as well as the updated Blackhawk version, which must be flown by Colombian pilots. The Colombians can put most of the transportation, communications and small weapons to work if they carry out raids against the ranch headquarters and cocaine processing plants scattered about that country's rough, mountainous territory. Included in the first package destined for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are machine guns, mortars, ammunition, 4-wheel drive vehicles, ambulances, communications equipment and anti-tank guns, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The anti-tank weapons could be used to blow up entire buildings, if necessary. The Colombians are also in line to get 12 more Hueys, a Blackhawk medical evacuation helicopter, assault boats, trucks, medical supplies and airplanes, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Although he did not identify which type of fixed-wing aircraft might be sent the Colombians, a good candidate would be an A-37, a small two-person attack jet that can carry small rockets or bombs. The Colombians already have 18 similar aircraft in their own air force and have pilots familiar with such a craft. The Blackhawk helicopter, which can be transformed into a medical evacuation chopper, is the larger, modernized version of the older <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>, and can carry twice the payload. Super noted the type of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trainers that will be sent to help will depend on the final type of equipment that is shipped to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` They may need help maintaining the equipment _ with mechanics _ or they may request training in tactics, map reading, or first aid _ any number of things that we could provide,'' <PERSON> Super </PERSON> said.

 The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said today it has received $ 135,000 to help restore fire - and water-damaged books in a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> institution where one of the worst library disasters in history occurred The gift from Reader's Digest will help experts counter the damage at the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, whose collection of 20 million books, manuscripts and periodicals was begun in 1714 by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great. Four million books were damaged or destroyed in a 19-hour fire in February 1988. The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a leader in developing techniques to rescue books threatened by decay or disaster. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> expert, went to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> after the fire to assess the damage and arranged for a protocol, signed by the two institutions, agreeing to preserve damaged materials and replace destroyed books. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, a Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expert on the conservation of damaged book collections, went to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> within six weeks of the fire. <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> welcomed the gift, saying in a statement that it underscored the principle that library collections `` are truly international resources for humanity which all of us must support whenever one of them is threatened by destruction.'' The library said the Reader's Digest grant will finance equipment, supplies and technical consultation to return to use many of the 200,000 rare volumes that were frozen in an effort to arrest deterioration after the fire. The <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> institution is one of the world's largest research libraries, although not nearly as large as the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which holds 86 million items. The Academy Library is a major exchange partner for most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research libraries that collect Russian and Soviet materials. Every year, several hundred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> specialists in <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> affairs visit there to do research. A few months after the fire, Soviet historian and cultural activist <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> said the disaster could have been prevented if officials had heeded warnings about the dilapidated condition of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most prestigious book collections. He said it pained him to see how rare books and art treasures that were spirited away by residents of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to protect them from Nazis who occupied the city in World War II had been destroyed through negligence.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says his political career is intact but he made a big mistake in hiring a paroled male prostitute to do personal chores at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who disclosed his homosexuality in May 1987, befriended and employed the man four years ago after paying him for sex. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat fired his employee in August 1987 when he suspected the man was selling sex from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s apartment. `` Certainly if I were a voter, I would not ask my advice on how to rehabilitate someone,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 49, said during a news conference Friday at his office in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb. `` I think I have had much better judgment in my public life.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called on <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to resign, but the congressman, up for re-election in 1990, said the incident would not affect his political career or plans. `` I do n't think I'm going to be heavily penalized by the voters for being suckered by a guy I was trying to help,'' he said. Some of his colleagues agreed. House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a Democrat, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` has provided outstanding service to his constituency and the nation, and I am absolutely confident he will continue to do so long after this matter has been forgotten.'' The only other member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to acknowledge being homosexual, Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., easily won re-election after being censured by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 for an affair 10 years earlier with a 17-year-old House page After revealing his homosexuality, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> won election to his fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote in the state's 4th District, which encompasses some <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburbs and parts of southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Barney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is on virtually everyone's list as one of the 10 ablest members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said. `` I suspect he will remain on that list for a very long time to come.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s hiring of the male prostitute was first detailed in Friday's editions of The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. The newspaper said the man was named <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said his real name is <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. No telephone number was listed for a <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or its suburbs. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he met the man in 1985, and estimated his age at 26 or 27. The congressman admitted paying for sex with the man once, but said the relationship quickly became one of friendship. He said he paid <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> to do household chores, driving and other errands from his own money, not congressional or campaign funds. The total compensation amounted to about $ 20,000 a year, including cash and payment of lawyer and other bills. In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a man identifying himself as <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> repeated charges that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was aware of the sexual activities at the apartment. `` He knew what was taking place. He knew there were clients coming to his house. As long as the clients were n't there when he was there, that was no problem,'' <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> called the man's allegations that he was aware of the activity `` absolutely untrue.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> should resign because there are laws against patronizing prostitutes. `` This is simply a question of a congressman who had the public's trust and violated this trust by engaging in illegal activity,'' <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> revealed today that he paid for sex.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said his only other contact with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, after the firing in August 1987, came in December of that year when <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> called to say he was having problems and needed help. At the hourlong news conference, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> refused to answer most questions about his sex life. But he did say the temptation to pay for sex was `` one of the things that led me to acknowledge being gay. ... It was one of the reasons I was vulnerable to being preyed on.'' He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he has now been in a monogamous relationship for about two years with `` a very sensible person and a steadying influence.''

<HEAD>Agency Sees No Conflict in CBOT Soybean Emergency; Senator Skeptical</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: RETRANSMITTING to add budget designator.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says a report by federal regulators raises conflict-of-interest questions regarding the activities of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> officials during last month's soybean emergency. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the nation's futures markets, said Friday that an initial review of the emergency liquidation in the soybean futures market found no examples of self-dealing. But Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, noted the report raised possible conflict-of-interest questions about several of the officials who voted for the forced reduction of holdings in July soybean futures contracts. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> must question those <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> directors participating in the July soybean decision whose affiliated firms held net short positions in the July soybean contract in house or customer accounts,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., in a statement issued by his office Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified price at a certain time in the future. `` Credibility is paramount for exchanges in carrying out their self-regulatory functions. The public will not tolerate self-dealing or conflict of interest by exchange directors or insiders,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. The Board of Trade, the world's largest commodity exchange, issued an emergency order last month requiring traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures contracts. That decision touched off wild swings in soybean prices and sparked sharp criticism by farm groups, and traders saw the value of their futures holdings drop. Those who had sold borrowed soybean futures on speculation the price would fall, in what's known as a short position, stood to gain from the emergency order because it resulted in a steep drop in soybean prices. The Board of Trade has said it took the action after consulting with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, because a subsidiary of Italian grain merchant <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.P.A. </ORGANIZATION>, failed to voluntarily reduce its large holdings in the July soybean market. <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the exchange was worried that soybean supplies were insufficient for meeting large holdings of contracts for July delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading in that contract. The July 11 order requiring traders to reduce their positions in the July soybean market to 1 million bushels was widely perceived as a move to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> from cornering the soybean market, which <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has denied. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> also has bitterly criticized the CBOT action. `` We continue to believe that is was totally unnecessary for the board to take its emergency action,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, an executive with <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> supports Sen. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s call for further investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> into the matter,'' said <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, also chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s preliminary report was contained in a 36-page letter to <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. Among the preliminary findings, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s review disclosed no <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> governing member appeared to trade for the purpose of profiting personally, or through an affiliated company, from prior knowledge of the July 11 order. `` Our position is that even though a firm held a position -LRB- in the July soybean market -RRB- a director would not be influenced,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Watkins Balks at Judge's Request For Testimony in Nuclear Pollution
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is balking at a request by a federal judge that he testify on what the government agreed to in settling a class-action lawsuit over pollution from a nuclear weapons plant. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> did n't explicitly say he would refuse to appear in the court of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, but indicated he would try to avoid it. `` My lawyers tell me that it's not essential, that I am not bound by law to comply with that thing,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said in a meeting Friday with reporters in his office. `` It's very difficult for me to be put in that position _ to demand my presence under these circumstances.'' The suit was brought by 14,000 people who live near the <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, weapons plant. The residents allege they suffered emotional distress and diminished property values as a result of uranium dust releases from the plant. They contend they still have the right to sue for contamination cleanup costs, but the department, which owns the plant, says the proposed settlement is intended to preclude any further suits over cleanup. The plant, known as the Feed Materials Production Center, is 18 miles from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, who must approve the proposed settlement, said Wednesday he wanted <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to testify under oath on his understanding of what the settlement entailed. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, lawyer for the residents, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was running the risk of being formally ordered to testify. `` Adm. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is picking a fight with the wrong judge,'' <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said. In a related matter, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he would present to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> within two weeks a plan for restoring the nation's capability to produce a gas needed to make nuclear warheads. The plan will include a recommendation that three active but idled military reactors in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> be restarted and run for another 15 years to ensure a supply of tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost warheads' explosive power. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> provided no details of the plan, but he has said he would like the first of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to be operating by early next year. All three have been under repair for more than one year, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> with a diminishing stockpile of materials for warhead production. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also said he would tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors should not be operated beyond 2005 because of uncertainty about aging problems. `` Not one of us would sign on a piece of paper that it's smart to take those aging reactors beyond that point,'' he said. `` There are just too many unknowns.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should move quickly to approve the financing for development and construction of two new tritium-producing reactors _ one at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> _ to ensure a continued supply beyond the 1990s. The department has said the plants can be built in 10 years for $ 6.8 billion. `` The fragility of the antique reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is going to be hanging over our heads like the Sword of Damocles until the year 2005,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A group of marine experts says the `` seven underwater wonders of the world'' could be lost without a global effort to protect the world's oceans and seas. `` We're killing the oceans,'' said former astronaut <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, one of a panel of experts who named the sites Friday to focus public attention on the world's underwater environment. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammon </PERSON>, president of the sponsoring organization, CEDAM International, said the selection was the start of an educational campaign aimed at preserving `` the world's beautiful but very fragile marine environment.'' `` If a concerted effort is not undertaken soon to protect and preserve our underwater wonders, they _ like the classic Seven Wonders of the World _ could be lost forever through carelessness, negligence or deliberate mistreatment,'' he said. The seven underwater wonders, selected by the 14-member panel of marine scientists, conservationists and explorers, are: <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>, an island group in <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>; the northern <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>; the Great Barrier Reef of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; the waters of the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> Barrier Reef; and the deep ocean vents in the middle of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. An honorable mention went to whales as one of the great living wonders of the seas. CEDAM International is a non-profit group of 1,000 mostly marine scientists and conservationists based at <LOCATION> Croton-on-Hudson </LOCATION>, N.Y. The educational campaign will include collecting data and publishing information packets about the seven sites, a documentary series, a touring exhibit of underwater photographs, school curricula on marine conservation and an art-quality photo book. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, an environmental consultant from <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, blamed the world's runaway population for the declining health of the oceans and marine life. `` We've got to stop population growth and we've got to eliminate our ignorance,'' he said. `` The ocean is a very delicate entity and people do n't realize that. Without healthy oceans, a healthy planet is impossible.'' The 13 other panelists included representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, the federal <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CSIRO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s largest scientific and industrial research organization.

 A young man from a poor, Hispanic neighborhood who went on to attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced to 10 years in prison for six armed robberies committed during school breaks. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Razo </PERSON>, 22, was convicted in June of six robberies and attempting to escape police after his 1987 arrest in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He was found innocent of four other robberies. `` He's earned his way to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, but he also earned his way to prison,'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> told the court before sentencing. `` Mr. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> needs to pay his dues to society now. Mr. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> needs to be punished for what he's done.'' <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> also faces trial in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where he is charged with three counts of robbery and six of assault with a deadly weapon. `` I have not disregarded the good things I have learned about you, Mr. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheinheimer </PERSON> said before she sentenced <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> on Friday. `` This is not a happy sentencing for this court.'' Rheinheimer, who could have given him a maximum 15-year term, was asked by the defense to consider <PERSON> Razo </PERSON>'s achievements as a star athlete and scholar who gave time to charity. `` I do n't know how it is that a boy such as <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> stands before this court facing 15 years in state prison,'' said attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>. `` Perhaps the gap between the barrio of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Habra </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was just too wide for him to pass.'' But <PERSON> Rheinheimer </PERSON> said she could not ignore the fact the crimes were premeditated and occurred over a two-year period, showing what she called a `` pattern of conduct dangerous to society.'' Each of the 10 store robberies, committed between December 1985 and June 1987, occurred during school breaks while he attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> for two years. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> sat expressionless Friday as the sentence was read. His tearful parents refused to comment. `` What can we say?'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said he planned an appeal. He called the sentence too severe, but added, `` The judge gave her honest opinion of what the crimes were worth and what the defendant was worth.'' With credit for time served and for good behavior, <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> could be eligible for release in about three years, <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> said outside court. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> will then face three years on parole. A $ 500 fine also was imposed. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> was a former high school football star, <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> `` Boy of the Year'' and outstanding student at <ORGANIZATION> Servite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>. The prosecution's case relied heavily on a videotaped confession in which <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> recounted with vivid detail the crimes, each committed by a gunman wearing a ski mask. The holdups at fast-food restaurants, grocery and drug stores, netted the gunman $ 27,000. <PERSON> Razo </PERSON> later retracted the confession, saying he was in a drug-induced stupor. He claimed he was describing crimes actually committed by a friend.

 Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Democrat who heads the panel that funds <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, says the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will have `` a long wait coming'' if they expect large sums of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Her comments came as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> prepare to start negotiations on renewing six military base leases that expire in 1991. Many Filipino lawmakers are demanding far higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in return, or a phased withdrawal of American forces. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, just back from a 16-day trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> wants $ 2 billion each year. `` I told them that if they are waiting for foreign aid to more than double, they have a long wait coming,'' she said in a statement Friday. Her sentiments have been echoed in recent weeks by other lawmakers visiting the region over the summer recess. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to pay the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> some $ 960 million until 1991, but <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said she would introduce a bill to sever the link between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base rights there. `` Either a base is necessary for mutual defense or it is not,'' she said. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> also issued a report she commissioned from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the watchdog agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could save the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> $ 600 million annually by assuming payments in Japanese yen for such things as utility bills and salaries of Japanese workers on the bases. The report also disputed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s claim that it can not increase support for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces without renegotiating the 1960 agreement for the stationing of American troops there. `` The Japanese are hiding behind this document, and our government lets them get away with it,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. The study praised <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for increasing its share of funding for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from 24 percent in 1981 to 31 percent or $ 1.7 billion in 1987. But it said much of the gain resulted from the fact that the stronger yen now buys more dollars. `` Although the increase in Japanese support from 1981 to 1987 is impressive when measured in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, much of it can be attributed to the decline of the dollar's value against the yen,'' the report said. When measured in dollars, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s cash contributions rose 137 percent, but because of the strengthening of the yen, the actual increase was 44 percent, the study found.

<HEAD>22-Foot Tall, 5-Ton Sculpture in Reno Honors Basque Shepherders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With the burden of a sheep thrown over his shoulder, a sculpture of a Basque shepherder stands against the solitude of a grassy knoll in western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` A figure as if sculpted by the wind itself,'' says an inscription on a concrete incline leading to the 22-foot-tall, 5-ton abstract bronze sculpture. `` A man solitary and strong, held straight by his own will, patient laborer facing onto the uncertain horizon of adventure.'' The sculpture, scheduled to be dedicated Sunday, culminates a four-year, $ 350,000 effort by Basques in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to erect a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monument to thousands of their countrymen who began coming here during the 1850s gold rush to roam the mountains, keeping watch over sheep. For 100 years, an estimated 95 percent of all shepherds in the West were Basques who had come to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> with a few dollars and worked to amass their own herds, eventually owning the largest sheep ranches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We felt if we did n't do something to honor our heritage, what brought us all here to this country, we would be lost in the melting pot of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' explained <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Inda </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the national <ORGANIZATION> Basque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Basque sculptor and noted artist <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Basterretxea </PERSON> said he wanted the monument named `` Solitude'' to capture the loneliness of the shepherd's life. `` I wanted it to look as though it was a stone carved from the wind,'' he said Thursday through an interpreter as the huge sculpture was erected. `` I wanted the shepherder to be part of the elements.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Washoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the Rancho <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> knoll was specifically selected as the site of the only monument to Basque shepherders in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because it used to be a sheep ranch. `` There just could n't be a better place for this,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` It's a typical sheep grazing area.'' The Reno site also was selected because it is the geographic center of the largest population of Basques in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 90 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Basques live in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Inga </PERSON>. About 75,000 to 100,000 Americans have Basque ancestry. Basques hail from the <LOCATION> Pyrenees </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> along the border between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Foreign dignitaries, including 70 Basque nationals, have traveled to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> for the dedication Sunday morning. The event coincides with the city's annual Basque Festival, which begins today. The bronze sculpture was cast in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and almost did n't make it out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because of red tape But prominent <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Basques helped cut the red tape, including author <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. `` It was held up by the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, adding he used White House contacts to help get it out of the country earlier this week. The Ministry of Fine Art released the sculpture after authorities were assured it was n't a Mexican national treasure. `` This has been a four-year effort to memorialize the only forgotten stereotype in the building of the early West,'' <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> said. `` You have the <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> riders, the miners and the cowboys, but the shepherders always were low profile and lived in solitude.''

 While cooler mid-Atlantic waters continue to sap Hurricane <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s strength today, forecasters say it's too early to waive caution. They note a similar storm in 1987 traveled northward to lash <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, causing substantial damage. The National Hurricane Center in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> predicts <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> is heading somewhere between <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. At 10:30 p.m. EDT on Friday, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s center was located near 43.0 north latitude and 35.4 west longitude, or about 310 miles west northwest of the westernmost <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>. The system was moving northeast at about 25 mph and was expected to weaken gradually over the next 24 hours. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, will probably lose its tropical characteristics over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, but could cause damage if it makes landfall, <PERSON> Kimberlain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> was spawned off the African coast and became a named storm Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph.

<TEXT>
 After eight years of guerrilla war, the U.S.-backed Contra rebels who fought to topple <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government will begin disbanding in less than two weeks The secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Friday that work will begin Sept. 6. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Brockmann </PERSON> to discuss resettling the estimated 11,000 to 12,000 Nicaraguan rebels, now based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Upon learning that dates had been fixed for the demobilization of the Contras, <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> said: `` That is very good news; we have wanted that for a very long time. `` I would imagine that the vast majority of the people would want to come home. Even some of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> contras have returned,'' said d'Escoto. Under an agreement signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the U.S.-supported Contras are to repatriated or resettled in other countries. The Tela Declaration calls for the rebels to be resettled by Dec. 5. Numerous Contra field commanders and guerrillas have said they will not give up their fight. However, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomat active in Central American affairs said preliminary talks with the rebels indicate they are quite willing to go home or be resettled, and that little resistance is expected. Disarming and resettling the Contras will require a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The world body's experts believe the size and cost of such a force can be minimized if the Contras are disarmed over a period of months in small groups, rather than rounded up and disarmed at once, he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had lobbied the Central American nations to allow the Contras to stay in their border camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> until national elections are held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Feb. 25, to maintain pressure on the Sandinistas to allow a fair campaign. Even <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, however, which has received lavish military and foreign aid from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, agreed earlier this month that there was no justification to allow the Contras to remain until then. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives the Contras $ 4.5 million a month in non-lethal aid, which may also be used for resettlement. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off money for weapons last year. The Contras later negotiated a truce with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and since then have launched only sporadic raids. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> also met Friday with <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> wants its Central American neighbors to turn their attention on disbanding the leftist rebel force trying to topple its government, a goal the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government shares. The joint U.N.-OAS statement alluded to that aim by saying efforts will be made to disband and resettle `` all those involved in armed actions in the countries of the region when they voluntarily seek it.'' The Salvadoran rebels are the <ORGANIZATION> Faribundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish acronym as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Inspectors to Probe Train Derailment-Explosion Disasters in Hearings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Maybe it's just her imagination, but <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> swears the train rumbling by her home has been louder since those hellish days in May when a train derailment was followed by a fiery pipeline explosion. `` It's like you stop every time the train passes to make sure nothing's happening. During the night it's just twice as loud,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, one of dozens of residents still looking for explanations and blame for the twin disasters. Beginning Monday, some of their questions may be answered when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> begins five days of hearings into the May 12 derailment of a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight train and the May 25 explosion of a <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gasoline line near the tracks. The two disasters killed six people and destroyed 15 homes, focusing new attention on pipeline safety. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing is intended to gather information to help the board determine a cause of the disasters and to make recommendations to prevent further accidents, said board spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. The board will pursue how workers calculated the load weight on the train, the quality of locomotive brakes, the cleanup of train wreckage near the Calnev pipeline and the effectiveness of check valves in the line. A final report, with the probable cause, is expected in at least six months. In the meantime, ` We're just kind of in limbo,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, whose house escaped serious damage but who continues to see a psychologist to help her deal with the emotional trauma caused by the disasters. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing marks the latest in a series of public hearings probing the disasters. In earlier sessions, government officials called the nation's pipeline safety programs inadequate, while industry officials responded by pointing to the industry's relatively good safety record Some of the sharpest criticism of the government's role in pipeline safety has come from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who say regulators are burdened by staff shortages, out-of-date equipment and a tangle of weak and confusing laws. The state's Pipeline Safety Division, which acts as the federal government's surrogate in pipeline regulation, employs 12 people to oversee thousands of miles of lines. Officials acknowledged that for several hours after the derailment they did n't even know of the existence of the Duffy Street pipeline, which supplies 90 percent of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>' gas and nearly all the jet fuel to <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> air force bases. The federal Office of Pipeline Safety said the <LOCATION> Calnev </LOCATION> line may not have exploded after the train derailment had authorities been given the power to order a pressure test on the line to search out leaks and weak spots. <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> did not perform the test, saying it did not appear necessary at the time. Three check valves in the pipeline uphill from the rupture failed to close after the blast and gasoline flowed back into the flames, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> inspectors found. Investigators discovered that the valves had not been inspected or maintained since they were installed along with the pipeline in 1970. Calnev has since inspected its valves and taken other steps in the wake of disasters, said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>, like other pipeline companies, vigorously defends its practices by pointing to its safety record, which shows that carrying fuel through pipelines is considerably safer than carrying fuel in tanker trucks or railroad cars.

<HEAD>Indicted Opposition Leader to Launch Anti-Government Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INCHON, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the largest opposition party, under indictment in connection with a spy case, said today he is launching a campaign to get his prosecutor fired and to force the government to expedite reform. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said it will battle the government in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the courts and among the people to speed democratic reforms and wipe out legacies of past authoritarian regimes. `` There are over 900 political prisoners in jail. This is more than were jailed at any one time under the <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> regime,'' he said, referring to the predecessor of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Speaking at a news conference prior to a rally in the western port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the indictment against him `` is tantamount to the government of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo declaring it has given up its willingness to carry out reforms toward democracy.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and two members of his party were indicted Friday for failing to report the illegal visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by National Assemblyman <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> has been jailed on charges of violating national security laws, espionage and accepting $ 120,000 from communist agents. He surrendered to authorities June 25 and was formally charged and expelled from the party three days later for a trip made in August 1988. National security laws forbid unauthorized travel to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has considered an enemy since the peninsula was divided in 1945. The two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53, but a peace treaty was never signed. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who ran for president in 1971 and 1987, has denied he had prior knowledge of <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip or espionage, and says the government has purposely harassed the opposition party to discredit and embarrass it among voters. He said his party will introduce a resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seeking the dismissal of Prosecutor General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-chun </PERSON>, in charge of investigating the case, and will call for televised hearings on democratic reform. In September, he said, the party will begin a nationwide petition drive to press demands for democratization and will hold rallies in 27 cities to denounce political suppression. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> charged that `` tortures are practiced widely even though the constitution guarantees the rights of suspects to be assisted by counsel.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> had been physically tortured for 50 days by being allowed to sleep only in brief intervals and enduring interrogations standing. He said others have had to endure similar torture.

 The works of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are popular with at least one captive audience _ inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s Lefortovo Prison, a newspaper said. `` There is much interest in political developments taking place in the country,'' the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. It said inmates at the eastern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prison _ whose cells have housed U2 pilot <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> and West German daredevil flier <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> _ are `` avid'' readers of the Soviet president's writings and speeches.

 Police believe the killing of Black Panther co-founder <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was an attempt by an admitted drug dealer to make a name for himself in a notorious prison-based gang. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, told investigators Friday he fatally shot <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> in self-defense after the one-time activist brandished a gun in a desperate act to obtain crack, Police Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. Other witnesses told police <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was unarmed, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, on parole for robbery, was arrested Tuesday on a weapons charge 14 hours after <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s death and about a block from the scene of the killing. He admitted to the killing Friday morning, while still in custody, was charged with investigation of murder and faces arraignment Tuesday, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. `` He wanted to be a high mucky-muck; he was a foot soldier and he wanted to be a shot-caller,'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> `` considered the murder a means to advance'' in the gang hierarchy of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. At a news conference Friday, police said they believed the confrontation was the latest in a series of run-ins between <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> and the drug-dealing gang. It occurred in a neighborhood where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, as minister of defense for the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, helped set up social programs to combat racism and help destitute blacks in the 1960s. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, 47, more recently had a history of substance abuse and entered a hospital treatment program in 1984. Police said they believe he had been using cocaine throughout Monday evening and early Tuesday. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> crossed the Black Guerrilla Family several times by stealing drugs, including earlier this summer when <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he was robbed by <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> of 14 crack pieces worth $ 160. Highly potent and addictive, crack consists of the hard, pebblelike pieces of cocaine prepared for smoking. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had known each other for about two years, said police. The Black Guerrilla Family operates on the streets of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s maximum-security prisons, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> served time earlier this year for a parole violation. According to a police account, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> went to a `` crack house'' in a drug-torn west <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> neighborhood early Tuesday and caused a commotion in an attempt to obtain the drug. He was told to leave the house and ran into <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> a short distance away. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> pulled a gun and demanded drugs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he refused to sell the drugs to <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> and shot him in self-defense. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said a man accompanying <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> witnessed the shooting, but police did not divulge whether the man, arrested Friday for investigation of auto theft, backed up <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s claim of self-defense. Police did not release the man's identity. Police said they recovered the 9mm handgun they believe was used in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>'s slaying, but provided no other details. Ballistic test results are pending. Two other men were arrested with <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> on Tuesday, also on weapons charges, but are not considered suspects in the <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> killing, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. Earlier Friday, a radical group held an angry protest that blamed the government for <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s funeral is Monday. At least 40 members and supporters of <ORGANIZATION> Uhuru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> took part in a noontime march in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> during which they chanted, `` Who killed <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>? Do n't you tell no lie, it was the government, the government, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' Congressional hearings in 1976 revealed that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> infiltrators sought to disrupt the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> and their efforts contributed to the downfall of the organization.

<HEAD>Government Confiscates 2,700 Cars From Freewheeling Bureaucrats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province has confiscated 2,700 cars from bureaucrats who squandered public money, according to an official report today. The Guangming Daily said the northern province, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s poorest, earned $ 13.5 million by reselling the vehicles and fining government departments that illegally purchased the cars last year The money will go to education, boosting the province's education budget by 7.1 percent this year, the newspaper said. New cars have been a main target of a yearlong government campaign to cut waste and reduce public spending. The Communist Party Politburo last month barred all senior party and government leaders from driving imported cars. But the Guangming Daily said local departments in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> had ignored government restrictions on buying new vehicles, and that many cars were obtained fraudulently. Some offices used money set aside for natural disasters and education, while others used their cars for personal pleasure and profit, the daily reported. Many of the offices registered their cars in the names of individuals or army units. Offices found violating regulations on buying cars were fined 30 percent to 40 percent of the car's value, the daily said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is courting more Japanese business by dangling the possibility of access to declassified military technology, including the know-how that went into building the Soviet space shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Southeast Asian lawmakers today called for the dismantling of all foreign military bases in the region, but they also said neutrality can not assure peace without superpower cooperation. Delegates to the six-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' Inter-Parliamentary Organization made the statement in a communique issued at the close of the meeting. The communique said closure of foreign bases and the removal of nuclear weapons `` will greatly facilitate the early realization of the establishment of the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality and Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone.'' It did not give a date for when such bases should be dismantled or directly mention the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which hosts six U.S.-run military installations.

 Police searched for an 18-year-old suspect and put bulletproof vests on five young white men subjected to death threats after they were charged with participating in a fatal racial attack. The five were charged Friday in the death of <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, who was shot Wednesday night when he and three friends, all black, went to the mostly white <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to try to buy a used car. Police said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and his friend ran into a gang of 10 to 30 young people armed with baseball bats and at least one gun in rage against interracial dating. Parallels to the 1986 <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> case deepened as it emerged that one of <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' companions, <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, 17, is a cousin of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> was chased to his death in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> by a gang of white teen-agers angry that blacks entered their neighborhood. As condemnation mounted from civil rights leaders and candidates in this year's city elections, police announced a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to other arrests and convictions in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported in their Saturday editions that witnesses identified an 18-year-old as the gunman and that he was the subject of an intensive manhunt. Officially, police said only that a sixth youth was wanted for questioning. The suspects charged Friday were led out of a police station wearing bulletproof vests. An anonymous caller had told a desk sergeant that `` they were going to get those guys as soon as they left the station,'' Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON> said. Police said the racial tragedy resulted from the anger of a young man who was jilted by a girlfriend who began dating a dark-skinned Hispanic man. The gang gathered to waylay black or Hispanics youths they thought were coming to the neighborhood to attend <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>'s 18th birthday party. Miss <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>, fearing trouble, had called off the party, and the white youths attacked <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and his friends, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, 18, and <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Banner </PERSON>, 18. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18, who police say was <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>'s former boyfriend, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON>, 18, <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stressler </PERSON>, 21, were charged with assault, riot, aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, and menacing and possessing a weapon, a baseball bat. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON> also were charged with conspiracy. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON>, 24, was charged with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civil rights. Police who impounded Modello's car and opened it after waiting for a search warrant said they found a bat inside, but no gun. Figures who played key roles in the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> drama also entered the <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> case within hours of the shooting. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the lawyer who won the only acquittal among the major <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> defendants, is representing one of the white <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> youths. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who as attorney for one of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> survivors forced appointment of a special prosecutor, is representing <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> was not the boyfriend jilted by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> conceded being at the scene and having a bat, but maintained the youth was armed to protect himself against the girl's threat that her black and <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> friends would beat him up. Police said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON> was cooperating with the investigation. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the only black candidate in the Sept. 12 mayoral primary, condemned the racism underlying the attack by saying: `` It was n't mistaken identity.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WILKES-BARRE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The parents of a 14-year-old boy never meant for their oldest child to die, believing throughout a 42-day fast that the Lord would save them from a financial crisis, their attorney said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>, accused of murder in the starving death of their son, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, had hoped their faith would sustain them through hard times, defense attorney <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said during opening statements Friday in the Cottams' trial in <LOCATION> Luzerne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court. <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said the couple and their 12-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, were shocked when they found <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> dead Jan. 3 at their home in nearby <LOCATION> Nuangola </LOCATION>. `` They never believed anyone would die and they thought God would intervene,'' <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> wept quietly throughout the opening arguments, while her husband, a former minister in the Seventh-day <ORGANIZATION> Adventist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, sat stoically beside her. After <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s death, his parents and sister were hospitalized for malnutrition. The family went without food for six weeks despite having saved $ 3,775 they said was a tithe belonging to God, police said. The 5-foot-9-inch teen-ager weighed 69 pounds when he died. In other statements, <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said the Cottams did not seek help because authorities did nothing years earlier when the couple learned their children had been sexually molested. He said they were too scared to turn to outsiders because they were afraid the children would be taken from them and hurt. `` The evidence will show more than anything else they feared the very thing we look to for help,'' <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Cianflone </PERSON> told the jury, brought from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> because of pre-trial publicity, that the family wanted to eat. She said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> had tried to stay alive by eating roots from the back yard and hiding a frying pan and oil in his bedroom. `` All the evidence will show that for a six-week period of time, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> did nothing to get out of the situation they were in,'' she said. `` They did not call for help. They did not call for assistance until after <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> had died.'' <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> suggested during his opening arguments that the <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> children had been sexually molested sometime during late 1983 or early 1984 when they attended a one-room, church-affiliated school. The Cottams had enrolled their children in the school, which had only five other students at the time, when they moved to <LOCATION> Luzerne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> had been assigned to be the pastor of four area churches. <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said the couple became concerned after <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> began screaming in the middle of the night and would awaken, crying and trembling. The couple pulled their children from the school. It was only after the couple moved to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> became pastor of another church, that they learned of the reasons behind <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>'s nightmares, <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said the Cottams sought medical treatment for the children and at the urging of hospital officials contacted state and <LOCATION> Luzerne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> law enforcement officials for help. When authorities did n't take action for several months, the <PERSON> Cottams </PERSON> decided to retreat from the outside world, <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said. They moved back to <LOCATION> Luzerne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, teaching their children at home, and turning to God for help from financial problems when <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> lost his job as a truck driver, <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of troops guarded a drug kingpin's estate northwest of the capital where police seized a bunker in a shootout and found documents containing the names of lawyers and others working for dealers, reporters and officials said. The son of a leading drug lord was arrested in the raid and questioned on Friday, police said. Meanwhile, cocaine traffickers threatened to kill 10 judges for every drug suspect extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s war on drugs, and hundreds of judges said they would quit if they do n't receive more protection <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it was sending $ 65 million in helicopters, weapons and other equipment to help the nation's week-old anti-drug offensive. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> also received two more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters for the drug war, officials said. Police said arsonists hired by traffickers set fire to a country club outside <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, home of the world's largest cocaine cartel, continuing attacks on establishment targets that began with bombings and arson Thursday. Police said the fire damaged two rooms. Authorities have arrested thousands of suspects and seized hundreds of millions of dollars in property since the crackdown began following the assassination of presidential hopeful <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> Aug. 18. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> Thursday said no property would be returned unless the owners appeared in person to claim it. Thousands of students wearing black armbands paraded Friday through downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s tomb at the Metropolitan Cemetery. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, in a nationwide address on television and radio Friday night, declared he was `` willing to go as far as is necessary'' to wipe out the illegal drug empire. A day after traffickers declared `` total and absolute war,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told them `` the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> people have taken up the challenge. They must know we will not retreat before any danger.'' Army officials announced the discovery of financial documents in a fortified rural bunker belonging to <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, reputed to be the second-ranking leader and financial brain of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. They said his son, <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, was among those arrested in the raid Thursday near the town of <LOCATION> Pacho </LOCATION>, 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The estate was seized by the military, which exchanged gunshots with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s son, two nephews and seven bodyguards, the officers told reporters of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>. The reporters said at least 500 soldiers had cordoned off the area Friday and were backed by six armored cars. Army intelligence officers interrogated the younger <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and the bodyguards of his father, considered second in the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>. Officials said the documents proved countless of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel's criminal operations. Reporters who visited the fortress Friday said the evidence included bookkeeping accounts and would support incrimination of a number of real estate companies, lawyers and other individuals in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and other Colombian cities. Also arrested recently was <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, allegedly <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s chief accountant. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5 transport plane brought in two Bell 212 helicopters that were delivered to Colombian authorities. The White House said $ 20 million in aid would arrive next week. Anti-narcotics police of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> received two helicopters each during the previous 24 hours, said diplomatic and government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said it underscored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to help <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fight drug traffickers. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> are two main sources of the cocaine processed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. About 550 judges in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and the surrounding province of <LOCATION> Cundinamarca </LOCATION> announced plans Friday to resign to protest what they feel is insufficient security measures. In <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, judges staged a two-hour strike. Judge <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garces </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cali </PERSON> told reporters he and others received threatening letters from the `` Extraditables'' _ the name used by traffickers in their communiques. In the letters, the drug dealers vowed to kill 10 judges for each suspected trafficker extradited. As part of the anti-narcotics war, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> reinstated an extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where numerous drug dealers are wanted. Since 1981, 220 judges, magistrates and judicial employees have been killed in a campaign of terror aimed at intimidating the courts into dropping prosecution of drug cases. Since Aug. 16, when <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> magistrate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was gunned down, judges nationwide have demanded better security. They staged a strike that ended Wednesday, although 48 <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> judges refused to withdraw their letters of resignation. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the 48 resignations on Thursday. The country's 32-year-old justice minister, <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieff </PERSON>, said in a television interview Friday that she `` was n't prepared to work in times of war, such as now.'' <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> was rife with rumors that Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieff </PERSON> was considering resigning, but her office refused comment. She is known to be a target of traffickers' death threats.

<HEAD>Murder Convictions in Gay Attack Reversed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state appeals court overturned the murder convictions of three men in an alleged `` gay-bashing,'' ruling that the evidence failed to justify the convictions. The 1st <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that no murderous blows were struck before the victim's head fatally struck the pavement. The court said the man was struck twice _ slapped and probably punched. `` The attack was unprovoked and seems clearly to have been motivated solely by -LRB- the three men's -RRB- mindless homophobia,'' said Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> in the appeals court's 2-1 ruling. The court cited the legal standard for murder when no intent to kill is shown: acting deliberately, and in disregard for human life, a person must commit an act that is inherently life-threatening. That standard can not be met by a beating unless it is `` so brutal that death is a probable consequence,'' said <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>. The court ordered the convictions reduced to involuntary manslaughter _ a death resulting from an ordinary assault _ with a maximum sentence of four years. If upheld, the ruling would reduce the men's convictions from second-degree murder to involuntary manslaughter. Lawyers for two of the men said they would be eligible for immediate release from prison, where they have been since 1984 on sentences of 15 years to life. `` Any anti-gay behavior is despicable, and people should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallins </PERSON>, lawyer for defendant <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` But this was never a murder. ... <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> slapped someone and a slap does not make him a murderer.'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said there was a good chance the state would appeal the ruling. He said it was `` a close question'' whether the men's actions were life-threatening, a requirement for a murder conviction, but that the appeals court should have let the jury resolve the issue. White, then 22, and co-defendants <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 19, had driven 40 miles to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> from their homes in <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>. A witness quoted <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> as saying, `` Let's go beat up some faggots.'' The men went to an area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> frequented by homosexuals and pursued two passers-by. One, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, 41, was struck and knocked to the sidewalk; he went into a coma and died days later. The court said the cause of death was the impact of his head on the pavement. The killing, and several other assaults to which the men pleaded guilty, prompted a public outcry. Then Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> posted a $ 10,000 reward in the case, and a state law was passed increasing damages in suits by victims of `` gay-bashing.''

 President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> and South African leader F.W. de Klerk pledged cooperation but reported no breakthroughs in talks aimed at rescuing a faltering peace agreement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, on his first diplomatic mission since he became acting president Aug. 15, conferred for nearly three hours Friday with <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> at his resort home on the shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kivu </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. A joint communique described the talks as `` positive, opportune and constructive, particularly at this critical state of developments in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' The statement said the leaders agreed on the need for more discussions. They refused to answer any questions at a lakeside luncheon following the talks. The Angolan government and the rebels agreed June 22 to a cease-fire brokered by <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, but the opposing sides have repeatedly accused each other of violations. Rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said Thursday that the truce was over, and told his forces to prepare for further fighting. An official close to Friday's discussions, who requested anonymity, suggested <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> would try to keep the peace process alive by serving as intermediaries between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the U.S.-backed guerrilla movement <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has been leading efforts to negotiate a settlement of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> endorsed his initiative after halting military assistance to the guerrillas last year. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is to meet Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Livingstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, on Monday _ a scheduled trip that led to his appointment as acting president after P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resigned in anger over the plans. As leader of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is favored to win election to a five-year term as president after parliamentary elections Sept. 6. The guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, has been fighting since 1975 for a power-sharing agreement with the Angolan government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplies the rebels with about $ 15 million in aid annually and routes supplies through <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The Angolan government and the rebels said Friday that more than 200 people had died in fighting this past week in central and southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The casualty toll was one of the highest reported since a cease-fire was declared in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in June. The rebels, in a statement released in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, claimed they killed 77 government soldiers who attacked rebel positions earlier this week. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged warring Angolan factions to reach a cease-fire.

That would be premature, Pravda cautioned. In fact, it said, the Communists by right are the most important group in Polish politics. `` One should not ignore the fact that the PUWP _ a more than 2-million-strong party of Communists _ remains the leading force of society and has always worked and acted for the good of the people, repeatedly led the country out of deep crises and been a herald of all progressive reforms,'' the Soviet paper said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election on Thursday, with the support of many Communist lawmakers, gave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and their <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies the first non-Communist chief of government in the region since World War II. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was chosen after parliamentary elections in which Communist candidates were trounced and after a Communist prime minister was unable to form a government in the face of opposition from the Solidarity labor movement. The Soviet government sent an immediate telegram of congratulations to <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, but Pravda's commentary, the most authoritative to date, cast doubt on whether <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> can succeed in breaking <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic decline. `` Is this the way out of the labyrinth?'' the newspaper asked in a headline. It never really answered the question. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has repeatedly said Polish politics are purely a matter for Poles to decide. But Pravda gave a picture of events in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s western neighbor that must have seemed quite familiar to Soviets who have seen promises of political reform at home accompanied by food shortages and unrest. And yet the Polish Communist Party `` has not been discouraged, has not given up its lofty and necessary mission to renew socialism, to achieve national concord and to reform the economy,'' Pravda said.

<TEXT>
 More than 100 East Germans fleeing their communist homeland defied increased Hungarian border controls and crossed illegally into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, authorities said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified law enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Eisenstadt </LOCATION> near the border as saying the East Germans crossed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> overnight individually or in small family groups. That marked a change from recent mass escape attempts. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> announced Friday that it would increase its contingent of border guards because they have been overwhelmed by up to 500 escapees at a time. The flight of politically and economically disenchanted East Germans into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> began after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> tore down most of the barriers on its side of the border in May. The move was welcomed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as a sign of liberalization in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, one of the Soviet bloc's most reform-minded countries. But it has led to tensions with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has declined to follow the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reform movement, which began in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. West German officials estimate that since July 5,000 East Germans with little chance of legal travel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> have used <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> _ a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally that they can visit freely _ as an illegal transit point to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which welcomes all East Germans immigrants, has exerted pressure on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as well, calling for a humane solution to the problem. Hundreds of East Germans also are refusing to leave West German diplomatic property in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, unless they are guaranteed safe passage to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners battled with howitzers today, but a police spokesman said the clashes had slackened since a Soviet envoy started a bid to secure a stable cease-fire. The spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules, said four hours of predawn shelling subsided after 7 a.m. into intermittent exchanges of machine gunfire and 60mm mortar rounds across the city's dividing Green Line. He said two people were killed and nine wounded in the artillery duel, which also targeted Christian ports north of the city and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> gun emplacements in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government today halted daily flights by military helicopter between <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s besieged <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave, sources reported. A Lebanese embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the ban and called it `` a temporary measure.'' The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government declined comment, but one source said the ban was imposed because <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> violated an agreement to use the flights for humanitarian purposes only and was using them to carry Christian military personnel. The helicopter flights and a daily hydrofoil service between the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, next to the airport, have been the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave's only links with the outside world. By police count, 796 people have been killed and 2,231 wounded since the fighting began March 8 between Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops and Syrian forces backed by Moslem militia allies. The spokesman said `` the intensity of the Syrian-Christian clashes has diminished noticeably'' since Soviet envoy <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> arrived Wednesday on a mission to halt the latest round of violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-civil war. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> department, talked with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Moslem Lebanese leaders before leaving Friday for <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for meetings with Syrian officials. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, a close Soviet ally, claims to be in full agreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which it considers within its sphere of influence. But <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contradicted the Syrian refusal to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> general as a negotiating partner. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has declared a `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. He says <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate, have betrayed their mission by fighting on the Moslem side. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> said after meeting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Friday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` strongly believes there are no military solutions to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> problems.'' A source close to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the general told <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> of his `` full readiness to cooperate with the Soviet effort'' on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said the Soviet envoy was working on `` a formula accepted to all for stabilizing the security situation and lifting the blockade'' imposed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies laid siege to the enclave in retaliation for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s March 6 blockade of illegal militia-run ports south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> aimed at retrieving lost taxes estimated at $ 100 million annually. A senior Moslem official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> `` offered Soviet guarantees covering the security part of a plan to defuse the situation and address the political crisis.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems, who make up a majority of the country's population, are seeking political reform guaranteeing an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians The Moslem official said the Soviet mission focused on reviving a three-member Arab League mediation committee's peace effort in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The committee, comprising leaders of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, said July 28 it had reached an impasse because <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to agree to setting a timetable for pulling its troops out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Syrian-Christian clashes escalated sharply after the committee's report, which <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> considered a victory for his cause The Moslem source said the Soviet diplomatic effort `` did not contradict'' the deployment of a flotilla of French warships in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off the Lebanese coast. `` The Soviet effort is the carrot and the French naval buildup is the stick,'' the source said. He added that the French naval presence `` is a message'' to the Syrians and their allies that `` storming through the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- enclave is not permitted.'' `` It is the same message that <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> delivered at the diplomatic level,'' he saidl. There have been reports the Syrians and Moslems militias were planning to launch massive ground attacks against the enclave, home to about 1 million Christians.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has set up a committee to investigate the possible involvement of its private security companies in training murder squads for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug cartels, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said today. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was not asked to conduct an investigation either by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but has offered its cooperation to both countries. `` Two days ago we asked the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government at the request of Foreign Minister -LRB- Moshe -RRB- <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> for any information available to them, and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said. On Friday, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve officer denied reports he was involved in training death squads for Colombian drug lords, saying instead he was an instructor for a group of cattle breeders fighting leftist guerrillas. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and all of the country's major dailies last week identified Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> as the head of a group of four Israeli army reserve colonels who allegedly helped train paramilitary troops and assassination teams in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 44, a retired commander of a paratroop anti-terror unit and president of a private security firm called Spearhead, was identified in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the basis of film broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I trained a group of farmers who defended themselves against terrorist organizations, mostly the group called M-19, a guerrilla group with the goal of turning <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> told national television Friday. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> probably will be questioned about his activities in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Friday from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the television said. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may revoke the passports of any Israeli mercenaries proven to be involved in the training of death squads for Colombian drug lords. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said, had set up `` an inter-departmental committee to look into this, in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and other offices of the government.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said four Spearhead instructors started to train a group of cattle breeders 18 months ago. He said the training lasted for six months and the film was a `` concluding film of the training.'' `` This group included only farmers who have been physically injured by guerrilla bullets and survived, or had their families killed. Nobody else was accepted into this organization,'' he said. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the organization enjoyed the `` tacit support of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. The first meeting with the group was preceded by a meeting in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that included a deputy government minister, two senior officers and a representative of a bank.'' He said military equipment and ammunition was used during the training, which was conducted in full view of an army camp. `` The Colombian government can not say it did not know anything about our training of such a group. I estimate it was interested in such bodies being trained to solve the guerrilla problem,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. He said he was convinced that the group Spearhead trained was not involved in drugs, but he left open the possibility that it was doing so secretly. On Thursday, the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in an official statement that Spearhead has been denied a permit and operated illegally in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. It said a second firm, which it did not identify, had violated terms of a permit to do security work in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> but that no link to illegal activities had been established. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> responded that he did not have a permit to work with official bodies but did n't need one to work with private groups. He said Spearhead entered <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with the help of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> company that provided security services for the banana plantation owners union. He declined to identify the company. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said his firm ended contacts with the group `` when we felt we were not needed ... and had a feeling the government started to ignore the body we trained.'' The Israelis, he said, were replaced by two mercenaries from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, one from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He said the organization may later have gotten involved in drugs. `` I estimate there is no organization today in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that is not linked to drugs, from the government downwards,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today appointed a Polish <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official as the first papal nuncio or ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since that country's Communist government severed ties to the Holy See in 1945. Monsignor <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Tarnow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, has been the head of the Polish section of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> secretariat of state since 1978. Also today, the Polish state news service <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> announced the appointment of <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuberski </PERSON>, 59, as ambassador to the Holy See. <PERSON> Kuberski </PERSON> has been in charge of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s working contacts with the Holy See since 1982. <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON>, who turns 51 on Monday, will be the only full nuncio to a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> are the only other Communist countries with full diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> restored full diplomatic ties on July 17, two months after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> granted legal recognition to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. That recognition came after 15 years of permanent working contacts between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the Communist government. It is the first restoration of relations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country that tried to muzzle organized religion after World War II. <PERSON> Kowalcyzk </PERSON>'s appointment was unusual in that he is from the country where he will serve as nuncio. Ordained a priest in 1962, <PERSON> Kowalcyzk </PERSON> worked for the Synod of Bishops and in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> department for the sacraments before he joined the secretariat of state. He also heads a commission for the publication of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s writings from the years before he became the first Polish pope <PERSON> Kuberski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, has been charge d'affaires at the Polish Embassy to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Holy See re-established formal relations. His appointment was made by President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s revamped constitution, the president controls ambassadorial appointments. <PERSON> Kuberski </PERSON> is a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a former director of the Office of Religious Affairs. As head of the Team for Permanent Working Contacts with the Holy See, he has lived the past seven years in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Also today, the pope named Monsignor <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Farhat </PERSON> to be the apostolic pro-nuncio in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and the apostolic delegate in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. As the pro-nuncio, <PERSON> Farhat </PERSON>, 56, will be the chief <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. He will also be the chief <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but the title apostolic delegate indicates he is accredited to the local church instead of the government. <PERSON> Farhat </PERSON> was born May 20, 1933, in <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kfaa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and was ordained March 28, 1959.

 Police today arrested 30 demonstrators protesting a controversial rugby tour by a squad of international stars. Two separate demonstrations, held hours before the start of a match in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, were part of a nationwide anti-apartheid campaign launched Aug. 2 to protest segregation and the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority. Twenty-eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel after meeting briefly with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, manager of the international squad made up of Australian, French and British players. Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protesters gathered outside the main branch of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsoring the rugby tour. They were identified as <PERSON> Dawood </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmeyer </PERSON>, a leader of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. The international team's visit has been denounced by activists as a breach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid. On Friday, riot police armed with tear gas and shotguns clashed with anti-apartheid protesters in townships near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Police wounded three youths and rioters reportedly killed two black men. The country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations met outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> today and were expected to discuss possible protest action against the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Police Commissioner Gen. <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> on Friday imposed restrictions on the two-day meeting of the anti-apartheid labor groups, allowing only union members to attend, prohibiting political banners and limiting discussions to labor issues. Dozens of police were present when labor officials began arriving this morning. The two organizations are the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, which has more than 900,000 members, and the smaller <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. As part of a defiance campaign led in part by the trade union group, dozens of blacks successfully sought treatment Friday at a whites-only hospital wing in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and clergymen announced plans to defy bus segregation laws in the capital city, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Similar protests took place at six whites-only hospitals on Aug. 2. On Friday, police fired birdshot to break up a protest at <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain township, wounding three mixed-race high school students. Another police contingent set up roadblocks outside the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> and fired tear gas at mixed-race and black students who had erected barricades on the campus. Police officials said two officers were wounded by a gunman in <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain, and reported that two black men were killed by rioters in separate incidents elsewhere after their vehicles were attacked, one by people hurling stones and one by a firebomb. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, a group of black and white clergymen announced that a campaign to desegregate the city's transit system will begin Monday. The ministers said blacks would board whites-only buses and whites would ride in mini-bus taxis, which are supposed to carry only blacks. They said the weeklong campaign would be peaceful and invited Pretoria-based foreign diplomats to observe.

<TEXT>
 Crack seizures in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> amount to a few ounces a year, a tiny haul alongside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flood. But many Europeans are getting worried. `` Crack is the specter I see hanging over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s home secretary, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, told delegates of the 23-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whom he invited to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in May to discuss drug abuse `` Our job must be to work together, urgently, to ensure that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> experience is not repeated here,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the only European country already battling a crack problem. But with crack's parent drug, cocaine, flowing into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> alongside horrifying images of crack's impact in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, vigilance is increasing. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the Paris-based international police agency, now monitors all crack seizures, rather than only those of over 100 grams, or 3.5 ounces. Agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> have held a workshop to teach Italians how to spot `` il crack,'' and the problem is likely to be high on the agendas of two major drug conferences. Crack is a smokeable derivative of cocaine that gives an instant, intense `` high'' as the drug goes straight to the brain, but wears off in a few minutes, leaving a lingering deep depression. But Europeans are divided over the size of the wolf at the door. The Dutch predict they wo n't even have a problem. Others doubt crack could find the home in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that it has in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where crime and drug abuse rates are higher. West German police have seized so little that they are not keeping track. Swedish police say they have heard of its use but have n't seized any. The Swiss confiscated two grams in 1988. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have seized none. `` The general rule is that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is four to six years behind the States,'' says <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s cocaine division. `` Of course, every rule has its exceptions and crack may be an exception. `` But then remember Angel Dust -LRB- slang for <PERSON> Phenyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyclohexyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Piperidine </PERSON>, a powerful psychedelic drug -RRB-. It swept the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and everybody waited in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for an Angel Dust wave that never happened.'' Nowhere is the debate more heated than in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which had 31 crack seizures in the first six months of 1989, and 27 in the same period last year. British authorities say they seized 102 grams, about 3.6 ounces, between January 1987 and June 1989, 68 grams, or 2.4 ounces, of it in the first half of this year. `` Although the number of seizures is still small, they have been quite widespread, with crack found in many of our major cities,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told another, privately sponsored crack conference in July. Problem users have appeared in the last 15 months in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tippell </PERSON>, who heads a counseling center there and is touring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities to study their responses. Because of crack's high cost here, <PERSON> Tippell </PERSON> says most users in the British capital make their own crack, which is easy to convert from cocaine. A `` rock'' of two smokes costs $ 30 to $ 40, double the price in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> says crack seizures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> total 600 grams, about 22 ounces, since 1986, although British drug experts say this might not include small amounts seized. Cocaine seizures, on the other hand, rose from 345 pounds in 1978 to almost six tons last year in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, exceeding the heroin haul for the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> says. `` We were caught napping when heroin first arrived in the early'70s,'' says <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundborg </PERSON>, narcotics bureau chief at <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s Ministry for Social Affairs `` The government ca n't afford to make that same mistake again.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is emphasizing education and treatment rather than all-out attempts to stop suppliers. `` The Americans are quite clear that if they would have their time over again, they would have given more emphasis to prevention work,'' says <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> meeting that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will increase annual funding for education and teacher training to $ 11 million, and provide extra cash for drug treatment and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> drug programs. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also will host an international conference next year on fighting drugs, especially crack, and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will hold a similar meeting in the spring. `` I am convinced that crack is on its way,'' says Sir <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart-Clark </PERSON>, a British <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker helping organize the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` The American situation today is likely to be the European situation tomorrow, with some slight differences,'' he said in a telephone interview. A non-partisan group of British lawmakers, returning alarmed from a study trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, called for targeting demand by setting up U.S.-style helplines and a national public awareness campaign. Despite his strong statements, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> rejects a national campaign against crack, saying this would advertise the drug. Ministers recall a national drive against heroin several years ago that was widely believed to have glamorized the drug. To portray crack `` sensationally as uniquely diabolical will only add to its allure,'' wrote addiction experts <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> in an Aug. 5 British Medical Journal editorial. But <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, director of an umbrella group of drug organizations says: `` Some of the hype about crack and cocaine is important in order to put pressure on the government.'' <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON> also cites the high cost of crack in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as a different mentality toward cocaine as reasons why <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may not be too badly affected. `` In the States, crack is a cheap drug for social underdogs,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, social underdogs drink alcohol or shoot heroin or take amphetamines. `` People here are well-informed ... even drug addicts discuss the dangers of crack.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Church Call to Release Military Rulers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Saturday rejected an appeal from the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for release of military rulers held in jail since their junta collapsed in 1974. The Holy Synod, which acts as the church's ruling body, made the unprecedented request Friday. It said the former dictators should be freed `` in appreciation of the optimistic spirit currently being cultivated for the more general reconciliation of the Greeks and the forgetting of past misfortunes and divisions.'' However, government spokesman <PERSON> Athanassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> said, `` The government was never concerned with the subject, and it does not comment on Holy Synod announcements.'' The current government is made up of an alliance of leftists and conservatives. The military, which seized power in April 1967, was toppled in July 1974 after it engineered an abortive coup in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The attempt led to a Turkish invasion of the northern part of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. The right-wing military dictatorship was responsible for the widespread detention and torture of political opponents and the suppression of a student uprising in November 1973. Three former junta leaders were sentenced to death in August 1975, but their sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment. Another eight were given life terms.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down U. Of Michigan Ban on Racial Harassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A University of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> policy aimed at cutting discriminatory harassment on campus is unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled. University officials proposed the policy last year after assorted racist acts, including a widely publicized incident in which a student disc jockey on a campus radio show allowed a caller to tell anti-black jokes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Avern </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> ruled Friday that the policy violates freedom of speech and was so vague that `` persons of common intelligence must guess at its meaning.'' The ruling likely will have national significance, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which challenged the policy on behalf of an unidentified <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> student. `` Universities from <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and in between are faced with these same kinds of problems and are considering similar policies to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. The policy barred harassment or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-veteran status. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> did not challenge a part of the policy that bars physical acts of harassment. `` The policy is clearly well-intentioned _ the university needs to address problems of harmful racism on campus _ but the method by which they chose to do so assaults the principles of free speech and freedom of expression,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` The judge has forced them to go back to the drawing board and develop a policy that does n't violate free speech but protects students from harassment,'' he said. `` The judge performed a public service.'' The university's general counsel, <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kircher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, said she was disappointed by the ruling. `` We had very carefully crafted a policy that would recognize First Amendment rights of students while addressing the very serious problems of racial and sexual harassment on campus,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the university had begun reviewing the policy before <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> held a hearing on it Friday, and now will decide whether to rewrite it or appeal the judge's ruling. A majority of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> had favored the policy, but <PERSON> Regent </PERSON> <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he glad it was struck down. `` My own belief is that people on campus should be completely free to speak as they wish,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` One might not agree with what is said, but if there is any place where we should have free speech it is our universities, where we seek to find truth.''

<TEXT>
 A political leader indicted in a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> spy case said Saturday he will try rally the country's splintered opposition forces for a new campaign to push government reforms <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> said his indictment `` is tantamount to the government of -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo declaring it has given up its willingness to carry out reforms toward democracy.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who heads the largest opposition party, vowed to battle the government in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the courts to speed democratic reforms and wipe out legacies of past authoritarian regimes. `` There are over 900 political prisoners in jail. This is more than were jailed at any one time under the <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> regime,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s predecessor in remarks at a news conference. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told a news conference that his party would introduce a resolution in the National Assembly to fire Prosecutor General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-chun </PERSON>. He is supervising the case against <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. Addressing an outdoor rally of 20,000 supporters in the western port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> later on Saturday, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> pledged to launch `` the strongest possible'' anti-government campaign. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and two other members of his party were indicted Friday. They were accused of failing to report to authorities about an illegal visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by <PERSON> National </PERSON> <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>, then a member of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s party. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> has been jailed on charges of violating national security laws, espionage and accepting $ 120,000 from agents of the Communist country. The opposition leader, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1971 and 1987, has denied prior knowledge of <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip in August 1988. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has said the government is attacking him an an effort to discredit the political opposition. If convicted, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> could face up to five years in prison. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said his party will begin a nationwide petition drive in September to press for more democracy and will organize rallies in 27 cities to denounce political repression. He said his party will join its efforts with those of other dissident forces. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, who heads the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the indictment of the rival party leader. `` The Suh case should be thoroughly investigated, but it is nonsense to indict the head of an opposition party simply for failing to report it to authorities,'' he told a news conference. His group is the second-largest opposition party. Both Kims ran for president in 1987 during a feud among opposition forces, splitting the opposition vote and allowing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to win the presidency without a majority. National security laws forbid unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has viewed as an enemy country since the peninsula was divided in 1945. The two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53 and never signed a peace treaty. In another development, about 350 radical students and families of political prisoners held a peaceful rally at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to denounce the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. They accused authorities of stepping up persecution of political dissenters. Government officials deny holding any political prisoners.

 A sustained drug crackdown in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> could eventually cut the flow of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but traffickers have too much money and too many tricks to be deterred in the near future. `` In the long term we may see a considerable reduction,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON>, chief of cocaine investigations for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the problem is the cocaine is already in the pipeline, and more people are using ` crack,' which uses less cocaine.'' Colombian drug traffickers process and ship most of the world's cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s government, following the murder of presidential hopeful <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, intensified its war on drugs by confiscating $ 200 million in property and making mass arrests last week. In a show of support, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Friday offered a $ 65 million aid package to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with its crackdown. Traffickers, however, buoyed by the big bucks and the ready market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been hard to stop. Many top dealers are millionaires. And one official pointed out that pilots, many of them Americans, can make hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single flight in a cocaine-laden plane. `` They are cagey,'' <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said of the traffickers. `` They are people who have a lot of money, and they can pay ohers to take chances.'' In addition, the Colombians could shift their operations to isolated areas in neighboring countries _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are concerned about that possibility. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strang </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> special agent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Colombian traffickers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sell their wares in large lots of more than 200 pounds at $ 8,000 per pound. On the streets, one pound broken down into grams nets a dealer $ 80,000. `` And it's even more for ` crack,''' he said, referring to a form of cocaine that is smoked. `` With one ounce of cocaine you can make 370 vials of ` crack,' which means you can almost quadruple your money.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> alone, estimates are there are 600,000 cocaine users, more than half of them devotees of crack, <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> said. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> confiscated a record 55 tons of cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up from eight tons six years ago. But production of the coca leaf is up in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the largest producers of the sturdy tree that nets four harvests a year. Additionally, detection of cocaine has become increasingly difficult as traffickers find new ways to smuggle it across every American border state. Officials point to the inventiveness of traffickers, who are slipping the drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in trucks over the Mexican border, small planes into the southern states, and large freighters that can be loaded at sea. `` We ca n't search them all,'' <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said. Smugglers have loaded cocaine at sea from one ship onto another, some from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and stored the drug inside legitimate shipments of furniture. In one case the cocaine, in liquid form, was hidden inside plastic bags and put into a fish tank. `` It was discovered when the fish died,'' an administration source said, adding that in another incident the drug was neatly and professionally stuffed inside the planks of imported picnic tables. The distribution chain starts with the large drug cartels in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and then moves to Colombian dealers inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. From there it goes in quantities of up to 150 pounds to the `` trafficking groups,'' mostly Jamaicans, Dominicans and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> street gangs, <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said. `` They purchase smaller levels and bring it to the inner cities,'' he said. The trafficking groups sell several pounds to dealers who operate what are called `` crack houses.'' Then the `` crack house'' owners sell to individual users. `` You've got level after level,'' <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said. Colombian cocaine made a notable entrance on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> streets in the 1970s and trafficking has grown to the point where `` Cocaine and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are essentially the same thing,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, spokesman for the administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy. `` But, hypothetically if you've locked up a dozen or so people that would not break the trade,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who deals with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> drug issues said: `` I think they are moving the networks out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, living there and enjoying the wealth, but the cocaine's going out from God knows where.'' A sustained crackdown in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> could `` over a long time have an impact, but I do n't think you could possibly tell for a year, and even if you grab the bosses, there's going to be somebody else who takes over,'' said the official, who following department guidelines spoke on condition he not be further identified. <PERSON> Kennington </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group seeking alternative strategies for fighting the drug war, also said cocaine traffickers would move their operation bases to safer areas. `` If you push it down in one place, it will pop up in another,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bribes, Fraud Tarnish Generic Drugs, But Not Much</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigations of bribery and fraud involving generic drugs have embarrassed the industry but do not appear to be dampening the popularity of its low-cost products with consumers. Industry officials and analysts say the public is so smitten with generic drugs _ which mimic name-brand products whose patents have expired, but cost up to 70 percent less _ there should be no long-term damage to sales based on the revelations so far. The $ 5-billion-a-year industry has been absorbing week after week of damaging publicity lately about falsified test results and gratuities paid to federal officials. More is likely in the months ahead. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> already has obtained guilty pleas from some industry officials and federal regulators. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have ongoing investigations. `` The image has been tarnished, there's no question,'' said <PERSON> Hemant </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a private financial analyst of the generic drug industry. `` But I really do n't expect anything other than business continuing to boom for generic drug companies.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Molishever </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Generic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group of 20 generic drug makers, concedes a `` fear is beginning to take hold.'' However, <PERSON> Molishever </PERSON> adds, `` Whatever downturn may occur because of the concern, and there is concern, we believe will be short-term.'' More than 400,000 prescriptions _ nearly one-third of all prescriptions written last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ were filled by generic drugs. Analysts expect that market share to keep growing, to perhaps 37 percent by 1993. Their optimism is bouyed by what has not been unearthed. While instances of falsified test results and gratuities paid to federal regulators to speed the government's approval process have been uncovered, there have been no indications of tainted drugs. `` I emphasize that we have no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of generic drugs has been compromised,'' <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in announcing a plan to beef up federal oversight of the industry. Pharmacists report no great hesitation by consumers to purchase generic drugs, other than the 26 that the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has recalled so far. To put that figure in perspective, the generic drug industry says that of 10,000 drugs approved for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 8,000 are copied and sold by generic producers, with more generic versions available all the time as patents on the original products expire. `` It is a little bit early, but our people are not expecting to see a dip in generic sales,'' said <PERSON> Maryellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kari </PERSON>, spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION> Walgreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, based drug store chain whose $ 4.9 billion in sales last year made it the nation's largest. `` There seems to be very little customer alarm generated by the publicity.'' Continuing investigations promise to produce more news in coming weeks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> _ which has jurisdiction because the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. _ so far has obtained guilty pleas from three <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, three drug company officials and two drug companies for various crimes involving the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s drug approval process. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Garinther </PERSON> says his office has spent most of its time examining gratuities paid by companies to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials to speed approvals of generic drugs in an industry in which the first to hit the market often gets and retains a huge share of sales. Only recently, he said, have investigators begun looking into allegations of companies substituting brand-name drugs for the generic products they claim to be testing. Under FDA procedures, companies send potential products to independent laboratories for testing, and submit the results _ paperwork _ to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for its study. Last June, <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, admitted it sought <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval for a generic blood pressure drug by actually testing Dyazide, the brand-name product it was supposed to copy. `` My guess is there will be guilty pleas,'' <PERSON> Garinther </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is continuing its investigations of potential irregularities by 11 generic drug companies. The agency is also studying the 30 most commonly used generic drugs _ accounting for 75 percent of generic drug sales _ to verify that they were approved for sale legitimately. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is auditing the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, its subdivision, to make sure its oversight of generic drugs is effective. In addition, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, plans to continue his series of hearings into problems within the industry and its regulation by the government

<HEAD>Deng's Children Give Assurances He Is Well</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Chinese government gave new assurances Saturday through a visiting Chinese-American that senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is in good health, despite persistent reports that he is seriously ill. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groups </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s children `` assure me he's in very good health and still smoking and swimming and sometimes scolding them. Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON> also said that during a dinner with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON>, he said leaders erred in using troops against pro-democracy protesters in June. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said troops were used because police were not experienced in handling riots and `` probably they did n't have enough police,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON> said. Speaking at a news conference at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, she said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> sent a message via his children that `` at this time it is better for him not to receive any foreign visitors -LRB- to -RRB- show he's not trying to take over and trying to control all the other officials.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, holds only one official post, as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and in recent years has turned over much daily decision-making to his proteges in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government. However, he still wields final authority, as was made clear when he ordered the June 3-4 army attack on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, in which hundreds and possibly thousands died. Well-placed Chinese sources have said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is seriously ill with cancer and is receiving medical care in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He has not been seen in public since early June. Reports from a variety of sources also indicate a power struggle is brewing over his succession, and that members of the conservative faction that led the June crackdown are trying to play down <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s illness to gain time to consolidate their position Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>, however, said she was told <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Beidaihe </LOCATION>, a seaside resort northeast of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> where he and other top officials vacationed in past summers. `` I think this is a time that the leadership is going through some rearrangement of who will do what,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>. She said she did not know enough about the situation to assess <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s stability Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, is the widow of Gen. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>, the famed World War II `` Flying Tigers'' founder. She has visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> often and occasionally advises President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Asian Affairs. She said she plans to report to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on her 10-day visit. Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON> said she met with Vice President <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON>, Communist Party Secretariat member <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangen </PERSON> and other officials up to the ministerial level. Topics of discussion included ousted party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was purged in late June in a power struggle over handling of the popular, student - led democracy movement and is still being investigated He has not been seen in public since late May, and the government has indicated he may be put on trial. Asked what the leaders she met thought of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON> said, `` Certainly privately people agree <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> did a great deal.'' She refused to go into more detail and would not say if her talks covered dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the astrophysicist who has been hiding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with his wife since June. She also refused to say if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked her to bring <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> up to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> but said that she met with the president before leaving for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` He did ask me verbally to tell his friends here that we are very interested in continuing the good relationship that we have tried so hard to build in the last more than 10 years or so,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s presence in the embassy has strained Chinese-U.S. relations, already at a low point because of the crackdown. There was speculation that one purpose of Mrs. <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>'s visit was to discuss <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>.

 Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands of dust orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and found evidence the planet has `` southern lights,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said today. The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited scientists as unique in the solar system, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON>, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands orbit <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> earlier. Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby. `` My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had one hell of a party last night,'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, a Voyager engineer, said today. The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile, 12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s north pole Thursday night, then dove past <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, the planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900 miles above the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface at 2:10 a.m. PDT Friday. During its approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> discovered six moons besides <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were first observed from Earth. It also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be a complete ring. While only the narrow rings were visible as <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> flew toward <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said. That makes them look like <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s broad rings, but only when viewed from behind <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The same thing happened when <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> passed Uranus in 1986. That planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft, which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus. <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s dust bands are not as extensive. Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at 30 degrees south latitude on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s ultraviolet light sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project scientist <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> said today. Because the scan did n't cover different longitudes, scientists do n't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> east to west, as do <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s auroras, <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> said. Miner said <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> also found nitrogen in <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere. Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth's atmosphere. On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles, but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on Earth to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude. Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On Earth they glow in visible light. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s lights glow ultraviolet because of hydrogen in its atmosphere. Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during the <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, Urban said. Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, which is four-fifth's the size of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon. But pictures returned Friday were more than enough to stun scientists. `` The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said Friday. `` We are almost certainly in a regime of volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane -LRB- natural gas -RRB-. The photographs show a cracked, frozen <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> scarred by thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters, mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far defy explanation. `` The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some other moons, but <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> is the first place scientists have actually seen ice volcanoes, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Photographs showed at least three inactive volcanoes. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000 to 2,000 feet high. The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen `` are very different from ordinary ice,'' said <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>, a member of the Voyager imaging team. `` That may explain the exoticness of the landforms.'' Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment of radiation that produced chemical changes, <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. `` We've got pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.'' Preliminary measurements of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s magnetic field suggest that it does not have a north pole and a south pole like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s magnetic field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said the relative scarcity of craters on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> tends to confirm speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> originated outside the solar system and became captured by <PERSON> Neptune </PERSON>'s gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons. <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> also revealed that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere and is covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog. On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said. Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look back at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space. Weary <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists, many of whom spent all night at the laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over the spectacular images being received. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> of the Voyager imaging team said: `` Wow! What a way to leave the solar system.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday marked the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II by condemning Nazism and Marxism as `` substitute religions'' and hailing democratic reform in his native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The pontiff singled out <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> while expressing support for the right of people to determine their own governments. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last week installed the first non-Communist government leader in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> made his appeals in a 20-page apostolic letter marking the Sept. 1 anniversary of the start of the war and a 12-page message to Polish bishops on the same subject. In the official English translation of the letter, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in it was `` our duty before God'' to remember the war in order to honor its victims, forgive the offenses committed, and reflect on its causes. `` We have a duty to learn from the past so that never again will there arise a set of factors capable of triggering a similar conflagration,'' he said in the apostolic letter, according to an official English-language text. He traced <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> atrocities to its denial of God and law, which he said led to the crushing of human rights and eventually the rights of nations. `` Nazi paganism and Marxist dogma are both basically totalitarian ideologies and tend to become substitute religions,'' he wrote in one of his harshest condemnations yet of communism. Focusing on his native land, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was on the winning side of the war but that under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule, Poles `` were forced to ask themselves whether they in fact being treated as the vanquished'' and were compelled `` to undertake new struggles. `` For in truth, a state whose society is not sovereign is no sovereign state at all,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in the message to Polish bishops. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was apparently referring to the campaign of the Solidarity labor movement that culminated last week with the appointment of a non-Communist as prime minister. At a news conference to release the papal documents, Cardinal <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was holding up <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as an example. `` He knows very well that the Polish experience is n't limited to a national reality but can also be applied to other situations, above all in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cardinal, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Peace. But asked whether the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was advocating democracy for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Baltic states, <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON> said, `` One should not imagine that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> tries to revise pacts, to revise <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s borders. In his statements, the pope also made a special appeal for an end to discrimination. He singled out the Nazi slaughter of the Jews as something `` which will forever remain a shame for humanity.'' About 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Jews and Catholics are now embroiled in a dispute over a Catholic convent at the site of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Jewish groups are outraged at the Polish church's refusal to move the convent as promised. They say the convent and its Christian symbols are insults to the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died there. Asked why the pope had not intervened, <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON> said: `` Knowing the degree to which the pope respects the local churches ... the pope shows himself even more respectful of the local church he comes from.''

<HEAD>At Least 36 Killed in Sinhalese Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At least 20 people were shot and killed in a central Sri Lankan village, military officals said Saturday, and residents accused soldiers of carrying out the killings. Up to 16 more people were killed in various attacks during the past 24 hours, officials said. All the victims of Friday's attack in <LOCATION> Tirapanne </LOCATION>, 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, were Sinhalese and their bodies were thrown in six houses that were later burned, said military officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. Residents in <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION>, 12 miles from <LOCATION> Tirapanne </LOCATION>, blamed the attack on soldiers in civilian clothes and said they apparently meant to avenge the slayings of a fellow soldier's parents. The residents, contacted by telephone, spoke on condition of anonymity. Pro-government vigilante groups and the military have been accused in the past of killing civilians during operations against Sinhalese extremists. The government denies the charge. An opposition lawmaker, <PERSON> Janak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Adikari </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION> that the Tirapanne toll could be much higher. He said hundreds of villagers had fled to <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION>. In another attack Friday, men in military uniforms burned six or seven homes in <LOCATION> Katukeliyawa </LOCATION>, 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Adikari </PERSON>, contacted by telephone. `` There are reports of five to six civilian casualties in this attack, but we do not have confirmation,'' he said. The military could not immediately confirm the attack. The government armed the military with sweeping powers under emergency laws to curb an anti-government campaign by the Sinhalese extremists belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front stepped up its campaign of assassinations and strikes after President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> imposed a nationwide state of emergency June 20. The government says at least 1,000 people have died since July 15. In their latest attack, radicals detonated a bomb under a police vehicle in <LOCATION> Kurunegala </LOCATION> district Friday, killing three policemen and a civilian driver, the military officials said. One laborer traveling in the vehicle also was killed and five policemen were injured in the blast about 85 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the officials said. They said two policemen and a wildlife official were killed Friday in an ambush of their vehicle in <LOCATION> Anuradhapur </LOCATION> district, which carries the same name as its largest town. A naval officer, a front member and three civilians were killed in separate incidents during the past 24 hours in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the officials said. One unidentified body also was found they said. At least 5,000 people have died in the Sinhalese extremist campaign, launched in July, 1987 to protest the government's peace overtures to Tamil separatists in the northeast. The radicals said the government gave too many concessions to the minority Tamil community in an India-sponsored peace plan of June 29, 1987, that aimed to end the six-year Tamil demand for an independent nation. Sinhalese radicals also were angered by the deployment of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast, invited to enforce the June, 1987, accord. They said the Indian presence compromised the country's sovereignty. The accord collapsed when the strongest Tamil rebel group rejected it, and began attacking Indian troops. At least 1,000 Indian soldiers have died in the fighting. More than 10,000 Sri Lankans have been killed in the six-year separatist war. Tamils, who form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, allege discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese majority who make up 75 percent of the population. The Sinhalese control the government and the military. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the ethnic problems of its small southeastern neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils.

<HEAD>Refugees Pour Across Europe's Borders in Biggest Migration in Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of people are streaming across European borders in one of the largest migrations in years, many using new travel freedoms to seek out old homelands. East Germans are flooding into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is granting some Soviet Jews their long-time wish to emigrate, and ethnic Turks have fled in record numbers to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> from virtual persecution in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. One immigration expert says the border-blurring flood may be the biggest mass movement of Europeans since after World War II. The bulk of the migration has been from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, with many taking advantage of looser travel restrictions to escape stagnant economies. About 400,000 ethnic Germans from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and five other Eastern European countries are expected in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year. That marks an emotional homecoming for the descendants of settlers who themselves sought a better life by heading eastward decades, even centuries ago. `` I myself left the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1952,'' says West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of the new arrivals from that Communist nation. `` I know what's driving these people on, and I know that no one makes a snap decision to flee.'' The number of East Germans reaching <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year is expected to hit 100,000, the highest number since 207,000 people arrived in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. So far in 1989, the majority of the East Germans leaving behind a growing sense of hopelessness in their bleak, pollution-ridden country are emigrating legally. But for those leaving without permission, the escapes can range from a death-defying swim across a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> river to a sprint across the border between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Many of the refugees are young workers who will be sorely missed back in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a country of 16.6 million. On Saturday alone, more than 100 East Germans crossed illegally into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, authorities said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> intensified a media campaign aimed at stemming the flow of refugees to the West. The Communist Party daily, <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>, printed 23 letters it said it received from readers criticizing West German media coverage of the exodus and warning East Germans of an uncertain future in the West. `` The West German media has become hysterical,'' the newspaper quoted a man identified as <PERSON> Hans-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuck </PERSON>. `` They want to hoodwink young and old into giving up home and hearth.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the promised land for another current wave of European migrants _ ethnic Germans whose ancestors settled in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> generations ago. `` Last year, we had 200,000 and this year we are counting on 400,000,'' says <PERSON> Ina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehl </PERSON>, an expert with the West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The numbers she cited reflect the new arrivals from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` After the war, it was 12 million people. That was the largest movement,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ruehl </PERSON> said, referring to the exodus of Germans from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> following the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' Third Reich. `` So, this is really the second-biggest such movement.'' By comparison, up until 1987 only about 600 ethnic Germans were allowed to emigrate from their homes in the harsh climes of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` Emigration is regarded by many as the only possibility to remain Germans, to preserve their traditions, language and culture,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Aug. 17, summing up the views of a new organization representing the minority's interests. Last week, the head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s visa agency said that due to eased travel restrictions, 200,000 Soviets are expected to emigrate this year. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON> said about 107,000 Soviets already have received permission to leave this year. Most of the emigrants go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Soviets have begun to open the gates for the estimated 1.8 million to 3 million Jews demanding the right to emigrate. Since 1971, about 300,000 Soviet Jews have left. Thousands have made their way to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, hoping to eventually reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used to welcome the Soviet Jews with open arms, that policy was tightened in October. The ethnic Turks streaming out of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> are leaving behind official harassment bordering on outright persecution. Bulgarian authorities have embarked on an assimiliation campaign, forcing the ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names. The ethnic Turks say they have been fined and beaten for speaking Turkish in public and for practicing Islamic rites. The number had climbed to more than 300,000 in three months before <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> began clamping down last week in hopes of forcing concessions from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities. About 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the past two years. The ethnic Hungarians also demand the right to use their language, and maintain their cultural traditions are violated. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s willingness to take in the refugees _ and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s championing of their rights _ have worsened the already strained relations between the two <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies Sheer economic need often remains the greatest force for massive internal migrations within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, demonstrated by the millions of Turks, Italians, Spaniards and others who have found work in northern <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries over the last few decades.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has decided to make sure dissenting voices are heard when the new denomination makes a pronouncement on a controversial social issue. The church approved a policy of recognizing substantial minority views Friday in a session that also affirmed membership in the sometimes controversial <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Churches. The ecumenical organizations include most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern Orthodox churches in this country and around the world. The method of handling church pronouncements, including dissent, came in the adoption of a document detailing the basis for speaking out on moral issues in society. Delegates narrowly approved an amendment offered by <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, providing that whenever significant division is shown in approving social pronouncements, summaries will be given of dissenting positions. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, argued this would `` reduce the force'' of statements and the Rev. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, contended it would `` take away impact and meaning.'' However, the Rev. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said `` intelligent and moral honesty'' demanded that there be room in the church for those who differ and that this should be openly recognized. `` As a parish pastor, this is one of the problems I have struggled with when a stand is taken with which someone does n't agree,'' he said The provision was approved by a 489-453 vote. Lengthy debate preceded the vote for membership of the 5.3-million denomination, fourth-largest among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Protestants, in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. The council has been involved in leadership conflicts and financial strains and is undergoing structural reforms. Bishop <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nycklemoe </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Southeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Synod </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said he had reversed his opposition to belonging to the council, sensing `` new directions and new spirit'' in it. Of the three Lutheran bodies merged into the denomination, the former <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had belonged to the national council, but not the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> or former <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> Lutheran Churches. The eight-day assembly, which runs through next Wednesday, also adopted working guidelines for ecumenical efforts for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> unity. Citing the biblical and theological bases for it, the 5,000-word document urges work for `` the oneness to which God calls the world in the saving gift of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. `` It also means to recognize the brokenness of the church in history and the call of God, especially in this century, to heal this disunity of Christ's people.''

 Police arrested 30 people in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Saturday during two protests against a controversial rugby tour by a squad of international all-stars. The demonstrations, held hours before the start of a match, were part of a nationwide anti-apartheid campaign launched Aug. 2 to protest segregation and the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority. In other developments, Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> sent letters to four Western leaders, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, describing the almost daily unrest this month in black and mixed-race townships outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. And the country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations met near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to discuss strategies for opposing laws that limit worker rights. Twenty eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> after meeting briefly with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, manager of the international squad made up of Australian, French and British players. Several demonstrators carried posters that read `` Mercenaries Go Home'' and `` Apartheid Tour Must Stop.'' Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protesters gathered outside the main <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of the rugby tour. Bank officials said they have received several bomb threats in recent days. The activists were identified as <PERSON> Dawood </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmeyer </PERSON>, a leader of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. The international team's visit has been denounced by activists as a breach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid. The International XV squad, whose tour was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rugby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, already has played two matches in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But Saturday's contest was the first against the South African national squad, the <ORGANIZATION> Springboks </ORGANIZATION>. Rugby is the most popular team sport among white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, who believe their squad would be the best in the world if allowed to compete regularly on an international level. Saturday's match, which the <ORGANIZATION> Springboks </ORGANIZATION> won 20-19, marked the first international competition for the South African team since a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> team made an unsanctioned `` rebel tour'' in 1986. In most sports, the world governing bodies have barred South Africans from international competition because of apartheid. However, the degree of sanctions varies in each sport. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has not been allowed to compete in the Olympics since 1960, and generally its amateur teams have difficulty playing abroad or attracting visitors. In professional sports, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> often lures foreign competitors with huge sums of money in cricket, boxing, golf and tennis. British cricket players have agreed to a tour in January even though they will face an automatic five-year suspension from international competition. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also stages an annual golf tournament with a $ 1 million first prize _ the largest of any tournament _ and consistenly draws top players. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, declined to release details of the letters. But he said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> mailed them to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. The clashes between activists and police have escalated steadily since the launch of the defiance campaign and police blamed two deaths Friday on rioters. The two labor federations that met Saturday _ the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions with 900,000 members, and the smaller <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> _ have said they make take protest action before the elections. Gen. <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, the police commissioner, imposed tight restrictions on the meetings, allowing only union members to attend, prohibiting political banners, and restricting discussions to labor issues. Dozens of police armed with shotguns and tear gas were present at the meeting attended by 800 delegates.

<TEXT>
 Six centuries after the Ottoman Turks launched their conquest of the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> from this city, <LOCATION> Bursa </LOCATION> is bursting with refugees fleeing part of the old empire. This city of ancient mosques and modern factories has become a symbol of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s problems in dealing with a flood of ethnic Turks migrating from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to escape a campaign to erase their culture. Since mid-May, 310,000 ethnic Turks have arrived from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> in one of the largest mass movements of people since World War II. The difficulties prompted <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to impose a visa requirement last week to curtail the immigration. The ethnic Turks say they are escaping a forced assimilation campaign aimed at changing their Moslem names to Slavic ones, wiping out use of the Turkish language and halting the practice of Islamic rites. Like immigrants the world over, the Bulgarian Turks flooded into areas where earlier arrivals had established communities. <LOCATION> Bursa </LOCATION>, 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, received the largest group, an estimated 75,000. `` Enough,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Teoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozalp </PERSON> in an interview. `` In three months the city population rose by 10 percent. We can not cope with it, no city in the world can cope with it.'' Immigrants, residents and city officials say the major problem is housing. Many immigrants have gone to stay with relatives, who are putting up as many as 15 or 20 newcomers in their three-room houses. About 20,000 immigrants have been given shelter in schools. But they will have to be evacuated shortly in preparation for the start of classes Sept. 18. In the shade at a schoolyard, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukruoglu </PERSON> <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> spoke of his problems since arriving from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> four days earlier. The welder had just gotten a job but was unable to find a home for his family. `` It was hell there, but it is trouble here, too,'' he said. Immigrants say that when they do find work, they get less than the minimum wage. For residents, the problems have mounted too. <LOCATION> Bursa </LOCATION> natives complain that some employers are firing workers to hire cheaper immigrant labor. They say rents have doubled and tripled since the arrival of the ethnic Turks. According to <PERSON> Mumin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gencoglu </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Balkan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, lack of organization by the government has exacerbated the problem. `` What are farmers doing in this industrial city?'' he asked. `` The government should have divided people according to their professions and sent them to areas where there are jobs or land available for farming.'' Prefabricated houses should have been constructed immediately, he said. The government has promised to give $ 150 a month to each family for rent beginning next month. `` But there are no houses for rent. We already had a housing shortage when they started coming,'' says Mayor <PERSON> Ozalp </PERSON>. The government tried to send the ethnic Turks to different parts of the country, but the orders were not mandatory. `` We have lost track of 100,000 arrivals,'' said the minister in charge of the immigrants, Ercument Konukman. `` They did not go where they were sent. We believe most went to <LOCATION> Bursa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>.'' Even critics of the government admit that no one expected so many Bulgarian Turks streaming in from the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, which was part of the Ottoman Empire. <LOCATION> Bursa </LOCATION> was the capital of that empire in the 14th century. The mass migration began when <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> expelled leaders of a protest against the 5-year-old assimilation campaign. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> then began issuing passports that allowed ethnic Turks to leave with a few suitcases and bundles of household goods _ unleashing a flood of emigration to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Turkish Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> initially said he was prepared to admit all of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks. Offers of jobs and housing poured in from around the country, and the first 100,000 arrivals were handled relatively smoothly. But <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> miscalculated, believing <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> would not want to risk labor shortages by allowing a mass emigration of ethnic Turks, who make up more than 15 percent of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s population. As of Tuesday, ethnic Turks were allowed in only with visas from Turkish consulates. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> has defended the new requirement as necessary to force <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> into negotiations on an immigration agreement. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is seeking to control the pace of the exodus and ensure immigrants are compensated for property left behind and accumulated pension benefits. Turkish officials have pledged to give priority in issuing visas to divided families, but immigrants are not satisfied. `` Now they have no hope, now they will be wiped out as an ethnic group,'' lamented one, <PERSON> Sabahattin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatipoglu </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pay millions of dollars in reparations for the brutal Japanese occupation of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island during World War II, a debt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government forgave in 1951 for diplomatic reasons. `` Although we feel that a moral obligation'' falls on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, `` we can not seek justice from the Japanese,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ada </PERSON>, governor of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory located only 1,150 miles from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. From 1941-44, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> suffered through some of the most brutal treatment ever inflicted on an American community. Survivors recall massacres, beatings, forced labor and other horrors. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` most unfortunately gave away our right to reparation from the Japanese in its 1951 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ... without anybody once asking our people,'' according to Ada. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes reparations, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government spent $ 8 million immediately after the war on 4,200 death, personal injury and property damage claims. `` There is no reason for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers to pay further compensation for World War II claims arising from enemy action,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1950 took over responsibility for <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Guam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reparations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> appointed this year asked for compensation totaling $ 160 million to include payments for deaths, injuries, forced labor, forced marches or internment. The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the Korean War, `` was a policy decision of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to conclude a quick treaty with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ... to turn <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> into a valuable Asian ally and a bulwark against communist expansion,'' <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> appeared last month at a hearing on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> war reparations legislation introduced by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>'s non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives. The measure faces more hearings and a possible committee vote later this year. The island of 212 square miles _ about one-sixth the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ was acquired from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. It remains a key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> military base. Japanese still invade Guam, but this time as tourists boosting the island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the 500,000 annual visitors to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>'s beaches. <PERSON> Blaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> say the new payments are justified in light of $ 67 million paid in <LOCATION> Micronesian </LOCATION> war claims and the $ 20,000 authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for each Japanese-American interned during World War II. Too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war and there was confusion over the eligibility of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> natives, who received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship only in 1950, said <PERSON> Blaz </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> senator <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Duenas </PERSON> said: `` Apparently, many who were eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.'' A Guamanian woman, Mrs. <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Emsley </PERSON>, recalled during the summer hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousness in a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated Chamorros, native tribespeople. She said a Japanese soldier had tossed her there without realizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he used a bayonet instead of sword. `` I could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and the dirt was beginning to choke me ... I had to bear the pain and keep still or else those Japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Emsley </PERSON>, now 58, said she finally crawled into the jungle and wandered for a week until another Guamanian fugitive found her. Years later, they met members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 3rd Marine Division who were liberating the island. Reparations `` will not remove from us the awful memories of the horrors we witnessed or experienced,'' she said, but they `` will show us just that somebody cares about what happened to us.'' <PERSON> Duenas </PERSON>, the senator, said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made death payments ranging as low as $ 221 and high as $ 3,500 to 750 people on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> after the war. Island residents maintain that 8 percent to 10 percent of the population, or up to 2,000 people, were killed and 90 percent suffered severe hardship, injury or disease. The <PERSON> Blaz </PERSON> bill contained an initial authorization for $ 20 million, specifying $ 20,000 for the estates of those killed, $ 15,000 for personal injury, $ 10,00 for forced labor and $ 7,000 for forced march or internment.

<HEAD>Spanish Leader to Call Early Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> will dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> this week and call early elections to coincide with the seventh anniversary of his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s first victory, a newspaper report said Saturday. Analysts said the early elections would allow the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> to take advantage of favorable results in European Parliamentary elections, disarray among opposition groups, and a strong economy. The independent <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, said the 47-year-old leader would dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 2 and set elections for Oct. 29. An election had been scheduled for June 1990 at the latest. The paper cited unidentified government sources for its report. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> would be seeking an unprecedented third term for the Socialists. On Oct. 28, 1982, the Socialists won a landslide victory in elections to gain their first Parliamentary majority in the history of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> democracy. They won another majority in June 1986. The analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s party could benefit from the June elections across <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, when Socialists won 39.5 percent of the vote for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. They said the prime minister also was taking advantage of a strong economy and the breakdown of an alliance between the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The Socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of Parliament. The <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 91, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has 28, and the rest of the seats are controlled by several smaller parties. In addition, the analysts pointed out that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s economy has grown by 4.5 percent annually for the past three years, setting a European record. Early elections could also disrupt the momentum of the leading socialist and communist labor unions, whose leaders have hinted at strike action later this year.

 Two men assaulted a screenwriter who is leading a campaign against direct distribution of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films in this country, authorities said Saturday. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-ui </PERSON>, 45, was hospitalized for head injuries after two unidentified men attacked him with rocks Friday in front of his house in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> blamed the attack on critics of his new job as head of an organization opposed to direct distribution of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by the Hollywood-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, police said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told police he confronted two men in their 20s while returning home from an outing with his son. He said the attackers hit him on the head with rocks after asking, `` Are n't you Mr. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-ui </PERSON>?'' Police were still looking for the attackers. On Aug. 13, six theaters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> showing films distributed by the American company, including `` Rain Man'' and `` <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' were attacked with firebombs and tear gas. Police said they were searching for a movie producer as a main suspect in the theater attacks. Actors and other members of the South Korean film industry have said competition from the U.S.-distributed films could wreck the local industry. A trade law adopted last year allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to bypass South Korean distributors by distributing directly to cinemas.

 A vintage steam locomotive, whose last run 36 years ago almost led to the scrapyard, will return to the rails next month. Engine No. 290 is ready for a new assignment, hauling tourists and railroad buffs on trips around the city and beyond. The inaugural run between <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> is set for Sept. 10. The thunder of the engine's 6-foot driving wheels has n't been heard in decades, since No. 290 pulled the crack <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> passenger train between <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. So steam buffs are hailing the restored engine's pending debut as a chapter in a battle against indifference, rust and neglect. `` I grew up in the steam era, and to see her back under steam is going to be an accomplishment,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Strike </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> _ now the engine's owner. `` I do n't know any kid, young or old, that does n't get a rise out of seeing a steam engine thundering by,'' he said. Restoration of No. 290 has been a joint effort of the society and the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which mostly manages state office buildings but also runs the `` New <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>,'' offering regularly scheduled trips around the city and to state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> over existing, commercial tracks. Once No. 290 is under steam, the engine will alternate with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s other steam engine _ the smaller and older No. 750 _ and its stable of four diesels in providing front-end power for trips. Built in 1926, No. 290 was slated for the scrap heap when the diesel age dawned in earnest following World War II. The engine's last run was in 1953

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Saturday to discuss coordinating economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and keeping international attention focused on peace efforts in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his concern about the general situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the issue,'' according to a statement issued by the vacation White House. A fleet of French warships remained off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for a possible evacuation of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> citizens. `` The two presidents commented on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and agreed to keep the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spotlight on the problem.'' On the subject of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the statement said that the two presidents discussed the election last week of Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prime minister `` and agreed to continue offering the support of their two goverments.'' `` Both presidents want to encourage the new government, while keeping in mind the delicacy of the situation,'' the statement said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has promised <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> $ 119 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid and is supporting some $ 325 million in new loans from international lending agencies. The White House statement, quoting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directly, said he told <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, `` We want to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in a coordinated way. They need an effective reform program that takes on the economic realities they face.'' Vacationing here through Labor Day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also entertained evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> on Saturday. The president started the day pursuing one of his favorite vacation activities, ocean fishing. He took out his speed boat <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of succeeding where he has so far failed on his 10 days in this coastal resort town. Earlier, he played tennis at his home on <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. Evening plans called for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> to entertain some 35 relatives who live in the <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and his wife and children also were visiting. By Saturday, the president had yet to catch a fish despite daily excursions onto the water. On Friday his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> body guards agreed to keep their protective boats and the media chase boats further away so as not to scare away a prospective catch. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and his wife were the latest in a stream of guests at Walker's Point since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival Aug. 16. The Grahams and Bushes were expected to attend church services together Sunday. All of the president's five children and their families have been on hand for several days. The Bushes this past week entertained Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> for an overnight visit. In addition, several friends have joined the president for golf, dinner and tennis. Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive here Wednesday for what is billed as a personal, social occasion rather than a working visit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been receiving daily intelligence briefings while on vacation and has conducted routine business, but mostly spends his time at golf, tennis, running and boating.

 Railroad workers heeded a call by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to end a one-day strike today, but they sent an appeal to Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> asking him to satisfy their pay demands. The conclusion of the strike at one minute after midnight Friday followed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s appeal that the new prime minister be allowed to start work with the support of all Poles. The independent trade union leader said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election was a `` breakthrough'' not to be wasted. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also suggested Friday that the strike by the railway workers in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city located in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, could be a `` provocation'' against <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who this week took office as head of the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. `` We trust that as premier you represent the interests of the working people and you will take immediately decisions satisfying our demands,'' the workers said in announcing the end of the strike. The statement was carried on <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, the state news agency. Abandoning the strike, they said, was `` proof of our support and trust'' for <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The prime minister, who assumed office Thursday in a historic transfer of power from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a Solidarity-led coalition, traveled to the southern shrine city of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> today to take part in annual ceremonies honoring the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most revered icon. He planned meetings with various political leaders as he began the task of assembling his Cabinet. In his first meeting with a top Soviet official, the prime minister met in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, the chief of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> who is on a working visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON>, acting as <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s spokesman. The meeting was private and its agenda was not known. Beforehand, <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> spoke with several of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s top Communist officials. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has generally approved the dramatic political changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda today said that while Polish Communists may have suffered a defeat, nobody should write their political obituary. The article appeared to be a warning to Polish radicals. With the <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election, Pravda said, `` Extremist-minded people are hurrying to write off the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because, they argue, it has finally found itself in isolation, abandoned by its associates.'' That would be premature, Pravda cautioned. In fact, it said, the Communists by right are the most important group in Polish politics. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met Friday with emissaries from the superpowers, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovikov </PERSON>. After the meeting, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will consider new ways to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but she did not mention financial aid beyond the $ 119 million President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered during a July visit. Solidarity leaders have been hoping for a $ 10 billion from the West, and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the West would be to blame if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new government failed for lack of financial aid. `` Obviously, we do have a budget deficit at home,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We will provide aid as we can, when we can, but there is already a very significant program under way.'' She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> soon will send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to study how they can help. Her husband, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., and three Democrats, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, also attended the meeting <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> told him: `` ` He who helps early, helps twice.' In other words, this is very important now to keep up the momentum and let the Polish people see some change.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who convinced Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to support the Solidarity-led government, said Friday that <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s selection was the `` breakthrough'' needed to stop <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic decline But to succeed, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs financial help _ and much more than the West has offered so far, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Friday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20.'' `` I will say that if we fail, we can blame the world, even the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that you have n't contributed with cooperation in these conditions of civilization development; you will be to blame for Polish failure,'' he said. In a show of support unthinkable just a few months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Miezcyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> interrupted an official visit to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to send <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> a telegram Friday promising the party's support `` in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovikov </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mazoiecki </PERSON> and congratulated him on his election by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> sent greetings to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, a government spokesman said.

 The defendant wriggled in his chair, hiking his elbows onto the armrests. He crossed his arms when he stood before the judge, who called him Mr. <PERSON> Kocher </PERSON> and told him he had been charged with shooting a 7-year-old girl in the back with a hunting rifle. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocher </PERSON> pleaded innocent, moving closer to becoming apparently the youngest person ever in the country to be tried on an adult homicide charge. He is 10. The boy let out a heavy sigh as he turned to his parents, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocher </PERSON>, after his arraignment ended Friday. Prosecutors have ruled out the death penalty if the the fourth-grader is convicted. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazuhanich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant district attorney, said life in prison remains a possibility, though he has n't decided yet what punishment he would seek. No trial date has been set. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s lawyer said prosecutors, who fought a request to move the case to juvenile court, should realize they are not dealing with `` a miniature adult.'' `` He does n't understand the concept of murder and does n't fully understand the concept of death,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> said after the arraignment. `` I do n't know how to prepare him.'' <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> is charged with killing a playmate, first-grader <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. She died March 6, two months before <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s 10th birthday, after she was shot as she rode on the back of a snowmobile. Schools were closed that day because of heavy snow. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, 13-year-old <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON> and other children were spending the day playing video games at <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> Kresgeville </LOCATION>, a town of 250 people in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Pocono </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON>, found dirty dishes in the house, he put the video games off limits, and the children went outside to ride snowmobiles. But <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s parents had told him not to ride snowmobiles when they were n't around, and he left the house angry and went to his home next door, <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON> testified. The boy said the shooting was an accident while he was playing with a gun. But investigators gave this account of what happened next, ticking off a list of deliberate steps that the judge cited in his decision to have the boy tried as an adult: <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> took a key from under a lamp in his parents' bedroom and opened his father's gun cabinet, took out a .35 - caliber <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> lever-action hunting rifle his father had taught him to shoot, and loaded After unlocking a bedroom window and opening it, <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> took out the screen and set it aside, and he pointed the rifle out the window, investigators said. At 1:05 p.m. a shot rang out, and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, about 100 yards away, fell from the back of the snowmobile <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> was driving. The rifle's recoil slammed the scope into <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s face, cutting his forehead. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> put the rifle back in the cabinet, bandaged his forehead and hid a spent shell casing. Fearing a sniper was on the loose, <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON> called <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> and told him to come back to his house for safety. <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> explained the bandage on his forehead by saying he cut himself with a knife when a dog jumped on him as he made a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich. As others frantically tried to help <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> sat on the Rattis' floor and resumed playing the video game, <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> kept playing the game while the other children prayed and made get-well cards for the girl. `` If you do n't think about it, you wo n't be sad,'' <PERSON> Ratti </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> as saying. The girl was pronounced dead about an hour after she was shot. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> was arrested two days later after investigators found his blood on the rifle. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> told psychotherapists he was playing `` hunter'' when he was looking through the gun's scope and the rifle accidentally fired. He said he could n't see anything through the scope but snow and trees, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadoff </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who examined <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> for the court, has testified. A ballistics specialist testified the rifle could not have discharged accidently unless a severe blow to the rifle forced the hammer to strike the firing pin. Citing <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s apparent mental stability, above-average grades and the deliberate actions he allegedly took before and after the shooting, <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Vican </PERSON> in June refused to move the case from criminal court to juvenile court. <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> has appealed. <PERSON> Pazuhanich </PERSON> said the case, one of two murders in the county this year, troubles him. `` I'm preoccupied with how the boy is reacting to the process. I'm preoccupied by the tension that's in that neighborhood when you have the Rattis and the Kochers living side by side and the <ORGANIZATION> Carrs </ORGANIZATION> still visit the Rattis and everybody is in close proximity to one another,'' he said. `` You wonder, as I'm sure the <ORGANIZATION> Carrs </ORGANIZATION> do, what was going through his head and what to do.''

 Media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> says British television is overrated, obsessed with the past and badly in need of competition. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, whose holdings include the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> television network in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as newspapers and magazines in several countries, recently ventured into British television with <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, received by subscribers on satellite dishes.

 Thousands of civil rights demonstrators, men clad in black, women and children in white, marched quietly upon the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the Capitol today in a reprise of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s historic `` Silent March'' of 1917 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> march was `` concerned with one issue alone _ the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and its recent hostile decisions'' diluting affirmative action and minority set-aside programs, said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. But the tone and style of the protest, led by six drummers with muffled drums, was fashioned after a march in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 72 years ago to protest segregation and the lynchings of blacks in the South. On that occasion, W.E.B. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> led 8,000 people down Fifth Avenue in utter silence; that day, too, the men dressed in black and the women and children in white. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> estimated the turnout when the march began at only 5,000, but revised that figure to 35,000 as the ranks swelled during the 1 -LCB- hour procession to the Capitol from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Mall. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> put the crowd which assembled on the Capitol grounds at the end of the march at 18,500, according Officer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevitt </PERSON>. Hooks claimed from the podium that the march had drawn a turnout of 135,000. Each of the marchers carried a printed affirmation which said: `` We march to send a message to all people regardless of race, color, religion, sex or ethnic orgin, that we will not and can not acquiesce quietly as an uncaring <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> majority dismantles court ruling after court ruling and turns its face toward the dark past and away from the present and future.'' And, it said, `` we march proudly in the footsteps of our brave sisters and brothers from another age who marched 72 years ago in silent witness against lynching, discrimination, segregation and racism. For us not to march at this point in time would be a grave disservice to them.'' The protest was aimed specifically at four decisions by the court this year. In the view of civil rights lawyers, the ruling in <ORGANIZATION> Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> sharply limited the previous power of minorities to sue private parties, including schools, for discrimatory practices. Similarly, the court's decision in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> vs. J. <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was seen as diluting job set-aside programs and other affirmative action plans. March organizers also assailed the decision in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilks </PERSON>, which allowed white firefighters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to attack a consent decree calling for the promotion of blacks as a case of `` reverse discrimination.'' The fourth ruling, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Cove vs. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, was criticized as shifting the entire burden of proof in job discrimination cases to the victims of employer bias, rather than requiring employers to demonstrate, at the same time, that their hiring practices furthered legitimate business interests. The march culminated with a rally at the Capitol, where Hooks and other civil rights leaders were scheduled to speak. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, and mayors <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also were on the program. On Friday, Hooks talked about recent incidents of violence directed at his organization, saying they have `` raised our level of concern not only for ourselves but for all other institutions and individuals who traditionally draw the wrath of racists.'' Several shots were fired July 19 into the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Last Monday, a tear-gas bomb, concealed in a package sent through the mail, exploded at a regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` These are the acts of terrorists,'' Hooks said. `` People could have been behind those lighted windows in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> several innocent people, including children and the elderly, had to receive medical care.'' `` If these acts ... were meant to frighten us or deter us from any course of action, they failed completely. We did not give in to terrorism when the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> was riding high and mighty and we will not give in to these latter-day terrorists,'' he said. `` We are not looking toward bringing vast numbers of people to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. `` In this instance, the medium is the message and the medium is the silent march.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has often been the target of major demonstrations in the capital in recent years. An estimated 325,000 turned out last spring to urge the court to stand by its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. However, the court weeks later softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for anti-abortion forces.

<HEAD>Army Studies Seized Drug Records, Eight Arrests In Candidate Killing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Army officials pored over seized records from a drug baron's financial empire Saturday and police announced the arrest of eight more suspects in the killing of a presidential candidate. Army Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Niebles </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview he expected the seized records `` to be of great value in our campaign'' to wipe out narcotics trafficking. Authorities said the records include numbers of local and foreign bank transactions as well as names of lawyers and others involved in the financial empire of reputed cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. The records were discovered at his rural, bunker-like estate seized by the army Thursday near the town of <LOCATION> Pacho </LOCATION>, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. `` We are processing these documents, which provide fine information on the estate,'' said <PERSON> Niebles </PERSON>, commander of the 13th army brigade. He declined to disclose details of the records or anticipate what actions, such as future raids, they might inspire. According to the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>, the records represent the financial books for <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> since 1982. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> _ nicknamed `` The Mexican'' for his affection for that country's music and culture _ is among the bosses of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. Based in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the cartel is the world's largest cocaine-trafficking organization and supplies an estimated 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Dozens of luxurious homes, apartments and offices believed owned by <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> were among hundreds of properties siezed in an eight-day-old offensive by police and military forces nationwide. The unprecendented crackdown was prompted by the assassination of a highly popular presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. Police in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> announced the arrest of eight more suspects in <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s killing Aug. 16 at a political rally on <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts, bringing to 13 the total of suspected participants or accomplices under arrest. Five heavily armed men were arrested in a surprise raid last week at a downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> apartment. Four of them were identified by more than a dozen witnesses at the rally. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s killing capped a 48-hour wave of assassinations, including that of a national police colonel in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and a prominent <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> magistrate. It outraged Colombian society and inspired the government crackdown, backed by a series of tough emergency decrees by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. Barco renewed extradition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and streamlined the procedure to reduce the need for extensive judicial review. Under bloody intimidation by traffickers, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nullified the extradition treaty in June 1987. About 11,000 people have been detained in the government sweep, including a handful of suspects described by Colombian authorities as major traffickers or drug-money managers wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Drug and legal experts at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy were working over the weekend to try to arrange the extradition of some of the suspects, sources said, as were Colombian justice officials. On Friday, authorities disclosed the arrest in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s alleged finance chief, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrio </PERSON>. Army officials said he was wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges. They said they also arrested <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a son of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, and that he also is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but there was no immediate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> confirmation. American narcotics experts in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> previously have confirmed that three other suspects arrested in the sweep are wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. Cartel bosses such as <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> continue to elude authorities. According to the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> escaped to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> Wednesday in a private aircraft. Local press reports have placed <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's most notorious leader, in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

At one ranch owned by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> soldiers found a wooden gallows, but said they have no idea if it was ever used. Another drug lord's estate featured a two-story stone playhouse for children built like a medieval castle. Opulent, mirrored bedrooms with tiger skins, valuable paintings and other works of art, saunas and indoor swimming pools are common features. At a mansion outside <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> believed to belong to reputed trafficker <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, the army uncovered a room filled with articles of withcraft, including potions, dried tigers' feet, rotting vegetables and fruit and images of Christ immersed in alcohol.

<DATELINE>JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As this city tries to return to normalcy after six months on the front line of the Afghan war, the frequent boom of heavy weapons serves as a reminder that guerrillas are still around. Schools, shops and factories are open again, but <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is a shadow of the legendary garden city beloved by Afghan kings for its <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> climate and leisurely lifestyle. This strategic city on the road from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is shell-pocked, but officials say the worst is over and there is widespread longing for peace. Since Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> has been the main battleground for the Soviet-backed government and U.S.-backed guerrillas trying to topple it and set up an interim government in the city. The rebels failed to take <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 45 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, after nearly 10 weeks of the most intense bombardment of the war in April and May. Government troops then pushed the guerrillas back along the main highway that leads to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, beyond the strategic crossroads of <LOCATION> Samarkhel </LOCATION>. Local officials took reporters to <LOCATION> Samarkhel </LOCATION>, nine miles southeast of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which government forces captured from the guerrillas in mid-June. It had been the most significant gain of the rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic Holy Warriors. There were no sounds of gunfire in <LOCATION> Samarkhel </LOCATION>, and government soldiers lounged under the few trees seeking shelter from the noon-day sun and smoking an occasional cigarette. On the yellow, shell-pocked wall of a building once used as a transport office were scrawled the words: `` Interim government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The hero mujahedeen of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' An arch over the road said: `` Long live the Afghan-Soviet friendship.'' Government officials refused to show reporters the Samarkhel garrison, at the foot of a rocky ridge about 2 -LCB- miles away, for what they said were strategic reasons. Although the government claims its troops occupy the garrison, the guerrillas claim it is a no-man's land The ridge itself is the last natural line of defense preventing the government from moving on the main guerrilla areas nearer to the Pakistani border. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Manok </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangall </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province which includes <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, said `` the important and significant spots'' were in government hands. But Western reporters on the trip said they had climbed the ridge recently with the guerrillas who controlled it. The guerrillas say controlling this ridge will enable them to launch a successful offensive against the Samarkhel-based government troops once they restock their weapons and ammunition supplies. The loss of <LOCATION> Samarkhel </LOCATION> has made it infinitely more difficult for the guerrillas to accurately launch their main short-range missiles against <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and its airport. In recent weeks, the airport's gravel runway has been repaired, and reporters flew to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on a fixed-wing Antonov 32 rather than by helicopter. But the flight was at night, in complete blackout to minimize risks of a mujahedeen attack. <PERSON> Mangall </PERSON>, who is chairman of the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said there were 12,000 armed guerrillas in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> now, but two-thirds were not fighting. `` Every night, I am negotiating with two or three -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- commanders,'' he said. `` Most of them are tired of war.'' The highly decorated general said the guerrillas have given up their plan to transfer their interim government to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, `` and the reconstruction of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is accelerating.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Bayazid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> teacher's training institute, which reopened last month after a three-month break, classes were very small and many classrooms were empty. A small nucleus of shops have reopened, but in the crowded marketplace, three out of four shops remained shuttered, a sign of continuing uncertainty about the future. The sounds of outgoing artillery fire and missiles and even a few incoming rockets are largely ignored. But the effects of the 840,000 rockets and other heavy artillery which <PERSON> Mangall </PERSON> said had hit <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> during 42 days at the height of the siege are not forgotten. During a brief shopping tour in the bazaar, 22-year-old <PERSON> Takar </PERSON>, who lost three members of his family in rocket attacks five months ago, heard there was an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist around and stopped his bicycle to say: `` I hate the American government because they are assisting opposition groups in our city. They are killing our people. We want peace to come to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' At the teacher's training school, 18-year-old <PERSON> Adilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehquanzadeh </PERSON> said she wanted to ask President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> why the Americans are arming the mujahedeen. `` If I met him, I would ask him not to equip the opposition with new weapons, not to kill our innocent people, especially our children, and to support national reconciliation,'' she said.

<HEAD>Police Say Fighting Diminishing After Soviet Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christian and Syrian forces battled with rockets and artillery on Saturday, but a police spokesman said hostilities have diminished since a Soviet envoy began a peace mission in the ravaged country. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing rules, said two people were killed and nine wounded in the clashes. Scores of shells and rockets crashed in residential neighborhoods on both sides of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line. The new casualties brought the overal toll to 796 killed and 2,231 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between the traditionally pro-Western Christians and Syrian troops. The spokesman noted that the exchanges were `` limited to two areas, which reflects the noticeable decrease in the intensity and scope of the shelling duels'' since Soviet envoy <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> began his mission on Wednesday. It was <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s first direct mediation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since the civil war broke out in April 1975. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s chief <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ally, where he met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> on Wednesday. He drove to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Thursday and met for two days with Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units with whom <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has refused to negotiate a peace settlement. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Friday and was expected to fly home this weekend for consultations with Kremlin leaders. His mission coincided with a French naval buildup off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said it sent a six-ship flotilla to the Eastern Mediterranean on a `` humanitarian mission'' to evacuate 7,000 French nationals if the situation worsens. But <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Moslem allies and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said the move was tantamount to a military intervention, and vowed to attack any vessel that approaches the coast. After his meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` strongly believes there are no military solutions to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> problems.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a spokesman said, expressed to <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> his `` full readiness to cooperate with the Soviet effort.'' The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> was working on `` a formula ... for stabilizing the security situation and lifting the blockade'' imposed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies on the 310-square-mile Christian heartland. Asked whether <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> would accept the deployment of observers at Christian ports to prevent arms supplies form reaching <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, as demanded by the Moslems, the source said: `` Would the other side accept observers to prevent the flow of weapons from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>?'' A Moslem source said the Soviet diplomatic effort `` did not contradict'' the deployment of French warships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` The Soviet effort is the carrot and the French naval buildup is the stick,'' the source said, also insisting on anonymity. He said the French flotilla in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> was `` a message'' to the Syrians and their allies that `` storming the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- enclave is not permitted.'' He said the Soviets agree with that.

<TEXT>
 High-wire artist <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> walked a tightrope soaring over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the second level of the Eiffel Tower on Saturday, and said later his biggest problem was trying not to have too much fun. With a brisk breeze blowing off the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, Petit leaped onto the rope at the Palais de Chaillot and walked 2,300 feet on a cord set at a 16-degree angle to the Eiffel Tower's second level, 330 feet above the sidewalk. Thousands of people watched breathlessly as he crossed the length of more than seven football fields on a wire as thin as three pencils, occasionally stopping to salute the graceful tower. On his balancing bar was a copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the enduring statement of social justice and liberty that emerged from the French Revolution in 1789. `` My head was full of pure and beautiful things, I felt a profound joy, almost like a child, an engulfing elation,'' <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> said afterward, looking windswept and tired but triumphant. `` The hardest part was not letting my joy surpass the control I needed to continue. I was invaded by a joy that was almost dangerous because I had my life in my hands.'' With well-wishers and the press on hand, <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> announced that his next walk would be across the Grand Canyon next summer. <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, known for his dangerous walks between the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s World Trade Center, slid down a gossamer thin rope to the second floor of the Eiffel Tower and delivered the declaration text into the hands of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. His slender 5-foot-7-inch frame was decked out at the beginning in a silver jumpsuit with sky blue scarves dangling from his arms and legs. Early on in the walk, he stripped off the costume by French couturier <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugler </PERSON> and was left in a multi-colored body stocking that made him look like a small exotic bird against the blue sky. He lay down, carelessly dangling a leg off the wire. He stopped to admire the monuments of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He waved his arms and kicked his feet. `` Magnifique, formidable, super,'' bubbled 8-year-old <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosc </PERSON>, who added that she enjoyed the show. Eighteen-year-old <PERSON> Fleur </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltes </PERSON> came 60 miles from the town of <LOCATION> Meaux </LOCATION> to see the spectacle and said it was worth the trip. `` It was really scary because of the wind, but it ended wonderfully,'' she said. The walk was the highlight of celebrations marking the bicentennial of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Partying continued Saturday night at a concert sponsored by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> under the monumental cube of the new Arche de la Defense. An international line-up of performers played in the nationally televised concert, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diva <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, Senegalese singer <PERSON> Youssou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndour </PERSON>, American jazzman <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Louiss </PERSON>, French rocker <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Higelin </PERSON>, African swinger <PERSON> Manu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibango </PERSON>, popular Algerian singer <PERSON> Cheb </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> and others. The events brought to an end a busy summer of bicentennial celebrations, which climaxed with parades and fireworks on July 14, the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille Prison.

<HEAD>Koch, Re-election Underdog, Tries for a Turnaround</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After months in a political coma, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s underdog candidacy for a fourth term is showing signs of life. But with the Democratic primary a little more than two weeks away, it's far from clear that he's overtaken the man seeking to become the city's first black mayor. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has cut back on his well-known acerbic rhetoric, is spending $ 200,000 a week on television commercials, and has been seeking out other political leaders. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> keeps publicly and privately pleading for my support,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Badillo </PERSON>, a prominent Hispanic political leader and former congressman, said last week. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has n't called.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, is <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s chief opponent in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary, and while <PERSON> Badillo </PERSON> has n't made his endorsement yet, his preference seems clear. `` The first rule of politics,'' he said, `` is that you've got to ask.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has been doing a lot of asking this summer, most of it with his trademark unselfconsciousness, and his efforts seem to be paying off. `` What we had to do was make the turnaround. We'd been in a descending posture, to say the least, for at least a year,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s longtime strategist. `` Now it's a very close race between <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> still leads in the polls, and some analysts say the mayor remains a hobbled candidate. Two polls of likely voters last week showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> at 42 percent, with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> getting 33 percent or 34 percent. The other two Democrats were in the single digits, with about 10 percent undecided. `` <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had to burp up a little bit because he could n't get any lower than he was,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, which backs <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. `` The mayor's worst enemy is not <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. It's the mayor.'' The two other Democrats are Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and former transit chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON>. Contestants for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination are former federal prosecutor <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and cosmetics heir and former ambassador <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>. Unpopularity dogs <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. He suffers from concern over soaring crime, drug abuse and long-running corruption scandals. Voters express fatigue with his nearly 12-year tenure; in April, 58 percent wished he would not run. Yet <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> knows how to court the electorate. The mainstay of his recovery has been a steady diet of television advertisements _ $ 200,000 a week's worth since July 1 _ featuring citizens touting his accomplishments. The mayor's image appears only in a small photo at the close. The effect is to play down <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s personality while playing up his experience. `` What the mayor has done right is to moderate his rhetoric. He is talking more about performance. He is not engaging in any personal attacks,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Crotty </PERSON>, his campaign manager. `` He says he is a kinder, gentler <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, and he has been for the better part of the year.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> still would likely lose a kind-and-gentle contest with <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. Understated, non-combative, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has spent more time collecting endorsements than dueling opponents. For <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, `` The unacknowledged campaign slogan for the last six months is operative for the last three weeks: Slow and steady wins the race,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, an unpaid adviser and former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's neither in <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' character nor the campaign's need to throw a lot of last-second hail <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> passes. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has sharpened his style somewhat, charging <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> with divisiveness and mismanagement and painting him, in a television ad, as a patron of housing for the wealthy. But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' message, overall, remains mild; one ad's tag line proclaims, `` You do n't have to be loud to be strong.'' The approach has its critics. `` <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has just been too weak a candidate,'' said <PERSON> Badillo </PERSON>, who has had fallings-out with both <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in past political wars. `` He's been too timid. He's not been effective And he's taken the Hispanic community for granted.'' Although ethnic politics have not played a dominant role, each candidate has sought to expand his base. An ad for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> stresses his support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and his criticism of Islamic minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who is Jewish, has ads that are peopled heavily with blacks and Hispanics. `` We're counting on a healthy proportion of the African-American vote,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishlow </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. `` But we also have lots of white and Hispanic areas targeted for get-out-the-vote operations.'' Getting out the vote is key in the primary. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, with strong union support, expects 7,000 volunteers to hand out literature, work the telephones and take voters to the polls. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> expects 2,000 volunteers. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> does have a tactical advantage on Election Day because he does have troops. On the other hand we have a tactical advantage in our incumbency,'' said <PERSON> Crotty </PERSON>. `` We've always believed that as you got closer and closer to the primary, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> would look better and better.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> on Saturday rejected the type of reforms embraced by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and condemned foreign activists who participated in recent anti-government demonstrations. At a rally, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said the party can not allow `` the weakening of the leading role'' of the Communists, the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. While no country was directly mentioned, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>' comments clearly were meant to draw the line between <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the two Soviet bloc countries implementing the most daring reforms _ <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Both have committed themselves to a multi-party system and increasingly favor free-market economics. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the first non-Communist prime minister in the Soviet bloc took office last week. On the foreign protesters, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> condemned `` the misuse of visits to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> for interference in our internal affairs, as it was demonstrated on Aug. 21,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> riot police dispersed thousands of demonstrators Aug. 21, the 21st anniversary of the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed attempts to liberalize Communism in ways that resemble some present Soviet, Polish and Hungarian reforms. State news media said 370 people were detained, including 50 foreigners. At the rally Saturday at <LOCATION> Banska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bystrica </LOCATION>, 300 miles east of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, Politburo member <PERSON> Ignac </PERSON> <PERSON> Janak </PERSON> condemned `` actions of ... so-called ` tourists' from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and some other countries,'' CTK reported. The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said, `` they did not behave ... as normal tourists, such as come to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> by the millions every year. Therefore a punishment must come.'' The Rude Pravo commentary appeared directed at two Hungarian activists. The government said Thursday that the rest of those detained had been released. The two _ identified as <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kereny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> FIDESZ </ORGANIZATION> political opposition group _ unfurled a banner at the demonstration proclaiming, `` Bolsheviks Came With Tanks, We Come With Flowers.'' <PERSON> Kereny </PERSON> also addressed the crowd before his arrest. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the two would be tried for committing an offense against the public order. It did not say what the maximum sentence could be. The Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, in a report from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, said the two were informed at the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> city jail that they would be tried. Also present were the Hungarian consul and a <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Lzicar </PERSON>, an attorney known for his defense of prominent human rights advocate <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. Both men submitted a formal complaint against their arrest, and the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> guaranteed the two would appear at trial, said <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomatic sources said, however, that the two remained in custody. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> FIDESZ </ORGANIZATION> supporters gathered in front of the Czechoslovak Embassy to protest the decision to try the two, and spokesmen said the group would continue the vigil. <PERSON> Janak </PERSON> also criticized Hungarian TV for airing interviews critical of the Soviet military intervention with officially disgraced Czechoslovaks on the night of the anniversary. Among those interviewed were the architect of the reforms, former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a prominent member of the Charter 77 human rights monitoring organization. `` Good neighborly relations, the spirit of mutual trust, respect and understanding are not built in a way demonstrated to us constantly by some foreign political journalists of Hungarian television,'' <PERSON> Janak </PERSON> said. When it aired initially in April, the <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> interview drew strong protest from the Czechoslovak leadership, which took power after the Soviet-led invasion. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was one of five <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries that participated in the invasion. But its Communist leadership has been the only one within the pact to call the military intervention a mistake.

<TEXT>
 While the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s deposed leader struggles in a federal courtroom, the Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> faces a different battle _ rebuilding the image of the church that was left behind. `` I sometimes envy the ministries that were n't affected by the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> mess,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, now the pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has moved from the 2,300-acre <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> park near here to three concrete buildings in a lower-middle-class neighborhood. `` Some ministries were affected by the scandal. But we were the scandal. We were the eye of the storm.'' <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was founded by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, whose trial on fraud and conspiracy charges begins this week in federal court. The jury was selected last week. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top assistant from 1984 to 1987, already has pleaded guilty to four fraud and conspiracy charges and was sentenced last week to eight years in prison and a $ 200,000 fine. It was <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> who asked <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s executive in charge of missions, for a $ 10,000 loan to handle a `` kook'' who was threatening the ministry. The `` kook'' turned out to be <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, whose tryst with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in 1980 eventually led to the television evangelist's resignation from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, investigations showed, arranged a payoff of $ 265,000 in ministry funds to buy her silence. The $ 10,000 loan landed <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> a seat before the federal grand jury that investigated <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> for 16 months before indicting <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> _ two former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> assistants who have been convicted of tax evasion and face up to 25 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines each in sentencing scheduled Sept. 8. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in disgust one month after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned, was not indicted. He later returned to take over <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The church, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said last week, has been badly battered by the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> fall. The television ministry is struggling to carry on nightly broadcasts. Last Wednesday, the church rented an extra hour of satellite time to appeal for funds and said the television shows may be off the air soon in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other major markets. As for the numbers attending services in person, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> avoids comparison figures, but the church's former sanctuary was about three times the size of the one the congregation has now. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, instead, compares the church to <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> of the Bible. `` His eyes were poked out, his hair had been cut off, he had lost his beauty,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said of the Old Testament character. `` But his hair grew back and the Spirit returned to him. And the last verse of that story is important _ it says he killed more Philistines in that final day than his entire life before. `` He came back from the lowest point of his life to a great victory,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a Bible school classmate of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s. Prosecutors contend that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives diverted $ 4 million in donations to the ministry to support fancy homes, designer clothing and lavish travel. Three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> was put under bankruptcy protection and the church was left to face his disenchanted former supporters. `` The bitterness was heaped on us from time to time,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Prosecutors say <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 158 million between 1984 and 1987 through `` lifetime partnerships'' that promised supporters three nights lodging per year for life in the hotels being constructed at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s expansive retreat near here. Prosecutors say the money was diverted to support the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' plush lifestyle In those years, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, drew $ 3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks. `` I do not believe that people begrudge them the salaries, though they were excessive,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` And I think people could forgive him for the <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> thing. `` But what hurt the most were the broken promises,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` That's what brought the bitterness, the hurt among those who believed in the ministry.'' In the church's new surroundings there is no Heritage Grand Hotel, no covered shopping mall, no sprawling water park. `` It's an old gymnasium,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, looking out at the rows of folding chairs. `` We're back to the basics here. We're not about buildings and land and water parks here, but the spirit is with us.'' The church bought the folding chairs, six television cameras and a broadcast truck from <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> businessman who bought <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> through the bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> sold the equipment at a bargain, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, helping the ministry to stay on the airwaves. The move from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s dream resort came from necessity, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, but it may have symbolic value in showing to journalists and others drawn here by the <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> trial that the church is no longer <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s church. `` We're hoping that when they come here, they'll see this is not the same place, that there's a different spirit here now,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Lutherans Hit Sexual Harassment Of Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> lashed out Saturday at widespread sexual harassment of women and called on congregations to make sure their churches are free of such mistreatment. At one point at the church's governing assembly, women who had experienced harassment were asked to stand, and about 40 of aproximately 300 women among 1,000 delegates did so. The Rev. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said that while sexual harassment and abuse has spread in the country, `` the church has done little about it.'' Some denominations have done surveys finding the problem extensive even among church personnel and have initiated countermeasures. The assembly here added its stern voice on the matter. The church `` will not tolerate any forms of sexual abuse or harassment by any of its personnel,'' the assembly declared, and pledged to make `` our church a safe place for all persons'' by moving firmly against such abuses. The 5.3-million-member denomination called for looking into the problem at various church levels and creation of procedures for victims to report incidents and also to provide `` healing for victims.'' `` Sexual violence of many kinds is widespread in our society,'' including `` sexual harassment on the job, rape and sexual assault, incest and child abuse,'' the resolution said. It estimated two-fifths of working women have been sexually harassed and a third of children sexually abused before 18. Such abuses `` betray God's creation, inflict grievous suffering ... and rend the fabric of the whole community of the people of God,'' the church said. Another action saluted the 20th anniversary of the start of ordination of women in the three Lutheran branches merged into the present denomination. It has about 1,000 ordained women among 11,000 clergy. Congregations that `` have not experienced the preaching, teaching or pastoral care of women'' were encouraged to open doors to them. Active recruitment was urged of women for seminaries and ordination. `` The church has made a commitment not to keep a separate role of silent and second-class women,'' said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, executive director of the church's commission for women. That means, she told the assembly, bringing `` the unheard, unheeded voices of women into full participation.'' Some feel that is to `` try to destroy men,'' she said. `` No way.'' In a report, she noted that 60 percent of the church's members are women. Recalling the example of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in regard to women, the report said: `` Barriers against women were woven into the fabric of the society in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> lived. But <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> reached ... across all those barriers against women,'' ignoring rules against them, putting Scriptures back in their hands. `` He appeared first to women as witnesses to his resurrection,'' the report said. The assembly is the first since the 1988 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. The eight-day assembly runs through Wednesday.

 The civil rights convictions of white supremacists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in the murder of radio talk show host <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> have been upheld by a federal appeals court. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected the defendants' arguments that they participated in <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s murder because they hated the outspoken broadcaster as an individual and not because he was a Jew The two had contended their federal civil rights convictions and 150-year prison sentences should be overturned for that reason. `` No reversible error has been demonstrated,'' the appeals court said in its decision Friday. The court also rejected other arguments by the defendants, including that there was insufficient evidence to convict them and that their civil rights trial amounted to double jeopardy because their earlier racketeering trial included testimony about the <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> murder. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> belonged to a group of white supremacists called The Order. They were convicted by a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> U.S. District Court jury in November 1987 of violating the civil rights of <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, 50, when he was gunned down in June 1984. They were indicted on the civil rights count, of interfering with a federally protected right resulting in death, because there is no federal murder charge. State prosecutors had decided there was insufficient evidence to try the two for murder. The two, along with several others, were also convicted of federal racketeering charges, which included allegations of the Berg killing, in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1985. Their 150-year sentences for the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> convictions are to follow their racketeering sentences. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was sentenced to 100 years and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> to 40 years for the racketeering convictions, which were based on their roles in <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s death, bank robberies and counterfeiting Witnesses had testified that the murder was triggered by <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>'s on-air derision of the defendants' right-wing beliefs

 The head of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-Communist leader, is `` a solid man'' who will succeed in solving the nation's problems Also Saturday, several hundred railroad workers in the city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION> ended their strike at the request of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The workers urged <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to grant their pay demands. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also met with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kansas, and gave them a letter for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seeking more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s struggling economy Party Central Committee Secretary <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, meanwhile, told a meeting of leaders of party committees that they should be loyal to the new Solidarity-led government, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service reported. `` There is no conflict between preserving ideological identity as party members and being loyal to the legal state authorities,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s meeting with <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> was his highest-level contact with a Soviet official since the Polish leader took office last week in a historic transfer of power from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I liked him,'' <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> told reporters after he emerged Saturday evening from seeing <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> at the Office of the Council of Ministers. `` A solid man.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> spoke of his plans for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government while he told <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> about social reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The talks were `` productive and interesting,'' he said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new prime minister `` knows how to deal with things,'' <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> concluded. `` We wished him great success, and he will be successful.'' Polish state television later broadcast the first part of the meeting on its main evening news. `` I am glad I can see you and that I have my first opportunity to talk to a representative of the Soviet leadership,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> told his guest. The irony of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a longtime Solidarity activist and former political prisoner, receiving at his government office the head of the Soviet intelligence agency is another example of the remarkable changes overtaking <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Communist world. It also seemed to underscore the high level of Soviet concern as it begins adjusting to the new reality. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> turned up without prior public announcement Saturday and first met with Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and the acting interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> replaced as prime minister. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> then accompanied <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> to the meeting with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. On Friday, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovikov </PERSON>, one day after he took office. The installation of a non-Communist-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been greeted with concern but apparent acceptance in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, although many of the practical ramifications have not been worked out. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has said that under his Solidarity-led government the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will retain the defense and interior ministries and that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will maintain its obligations to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc economic alliance. But it has not been made clear if <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister will have access to sensitive state secrets concerning, for instance, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact defense strategies, or if he will sit in on all the discussions at the annual full <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summits. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest and most strategic East bloc ally, linking it to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the front-line state facing the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> states in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, controls the secret police, intelligence gathering and border defense for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> has been chairman since last year and has brought an unprecedented openness to the post, undergoing questioning from Soviet legislators and granting several press interviews. Before meeting <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> flew by helicopter to the southern shrine city of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> for annual ceremonies honoring the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most revered icon, at the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery. A meeting of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops was taking place at the monastery. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> is the first practicing <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> to lead the government in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a country in which more than 90 percent of the people consider themselves <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. In other developments Saturday: _ Railroad workers in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, under pressure from <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, ended a one-day strike and sent an appeal to <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, `` our premier,'' asking him to satisfy their pay demands The conclusion of the railroad strike at 12:01 a.m. followed an appeal by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> that the new prime minister be given a chance to begin to work. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election was a `` breakthrough'' not to be wasted. Abandoning the strike, rail workers said in a statement, was `` a proof of our support and trust'' for <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The strike by several hundreds workers had shut down all local train service. _ <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> with the Doles, who delivered a letter of greeting from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` I am very satisfied,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> there is great interest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> now, and I hope these visits which are so numerous recently will help encouraged investors to get involved in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' He said he was giving the Doles a letter for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asking for increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic involvement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to match the faster pace of reforms going on. But Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after the meeting she did not foresee immediate financial aid beyond the $ 119 million that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered during a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July. `` Of course, as we can and when we can we will hope to increase that aid,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday harshly criticized nationalist activists in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republics </LOCATION>, saying they are leading the restive region into an `` abyss.'' The official message from the party's policy-making body accused `` separatist elements'' of whipping up `` nationalist hysteria'' in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and appealed for an end to their push for secession. The message came three days after more than 1 million residents of the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> region linked hands in a giant chain to protest the Soviet-Nazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of the three states. The sharply worded appeal showed clear concern in the highest councils of the Soviet leadership about the possibility of the beginning of the breakup of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a nation of many ethnic groups. The statement was read as the top item on the nightly news program `` Vremya'' and carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` Things have gone far. Serious danger is threatening the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said. `` People should know what abyss their nationalist leaders are pushing them toward.'' In an apparent reference to economic problems, the message continued: `` If they managed to attain their goals, the consequences could be catastrophic for their peoples. Their very ability to survive could come under question.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also criticized the three republics' government and party leaders, saying some did not try hard enough to stop the slide toward separatism and others `` played up to the nationalist mood and weakened their opposition to separatist plans. Grassroots Baltic groups have turned during the past weeks to more and more active agitation for full independence for their small republics. Their increasingly open calls for secession have brought counterattacks in the central Soviet press, but Saturday's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> message was <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s sharpest response so far. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> condemned the `` anti-socialist, anti-Soviet thrust'' of the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> activists and said they were working against the common interests of the Soviet people. In initial reaction, <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> activists said the appeal would not divert them from their drive for independence. The message `` wo n't have any particular effect because it does n't include any concrete steps,'' said <PERSON> Ulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaevats </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> `` I see it as an expression of weakness and of a policy that is not very rational.''

 The government is investigating whether private security companies from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> helped train assassination squads for Colombian drug lords, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve officer whom news reports have linked to such activities said he had actually been teaching cattlemen how to protect themselves from communist guerrillas. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had set up a special investigating committee without being requested to do so by either <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> launched a major drive to break up the drug-trafficking underworld in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> after drug bosses there had a presidential candidate killed last week. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel supplies most of the cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Two days ago, we asked the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government at the request of Foreign Minister -LRB- Moshe -RRB- <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> for any information available to them, and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said. `` We need to find out if Israelis indeed are involved ... and what we can do to make sure that they are not,'' he added. The Israeli government made the request after <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news reports that some Israelis were helping Colombian drug cartels train assassination squads. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would take action against anyone found to have violated Israeli laws. He had said Friday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may revoke passports of any Israeli mercenaries proven to be involved in training assassination squads. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, identified as an Israeli trainer of such squads on the basis of videotape broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Friday from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The 44-year-old Israeli is a retired commander of a paratroop anti-terror unit and president of a private security firm called Spearhead. `` I trained a group of farmers who defended themselves against terrorist organizations, mostly the group called M-19, a guerrilla group with the goal of turning <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said on Israeli television Friday. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> is likely to be questioned about his activities in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The television said that the ministry is considering filing a police complaint. However, Israeli television and major dailies last week identified <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> as the leader of four Israeli army reserve colonels reported to have worked with the Colombian drug traffickers. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said Saturday on armed forces radio that his company trained Colombian cattlemen and that the video in which he was shown was made by Spearhead for advertising purposes. He said the company completed its training a year ago and that his last visit to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was four months ago. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said that visit had nothing to do with the training program, but he did not say exactly why he went.

<TEXT>
 A magazine said Saturday that federal prosecutors are preparing to charge a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier with treason for his alleged role in a spy ring that sold <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secrets to the Soviets. The Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> magazine said it would be the first time in West German history that a foreigner faced such charges. According to the <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION> report, federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION> are concluding an investigation and preparing to charge <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> with high treason. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> remains in investigative custody in a West German prison following his arrest in August 1988. Under West German law, the 42-year-old former soldier would face a maximum 10-year prison sentence if convicted on spying charges. However, he could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of high treason. The federal prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION> was closed Saturday, and officials could not be reached immediately to comment on the report. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> did not say when <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> would be charged. In February, prosecutors said their investigation of <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> had showed that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategies were damaged more than they thought when he was arrested. Authorities suspect <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> acted as ringleader of an international spy network that sold the Soviets information about the Western alliance's nuclear missiles, bases, and troop strengths. Prosecutors believe <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, who had access to secret documents before retiring from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, collected more than $ 1 million for peddling the secrets. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the former sergeant is suspected of selling the Soviets secret rocket codes for nuclear weapons on West German soil. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was in charge of keeping classified <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> documents, which were held in a safe at the Bad Kreuznach base. News reports at the time of <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s arrest said he had hired other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to obtain information. The material was was passed by couriers to a Hungarian intelligence officer in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and then on to the Soviets, according to the reports.

 A prison gang member was held without bail Saturday in the death of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> as the family and friends of the Black Panther co-founder prepared for funeral services. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, faced arraignment on a charge of homicide Monday, the same day as <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s public funeral here. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, 47, was shot to death early Tuesday in what police described as a continuing dispute over drugs. Police said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, arrested 14 hours after the slaying, told investigators Friday he shot <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> three times in the head in self-defense. He said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, who had a history of substance abuse, pulled a gun and demanded crack cocaine, but police said there was no evidence <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was armed. Instead, investigators said they believe <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s slaying was an attempt by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an admitted small-time drug dealer, to make a name for himself in the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION>, a drug-running prison-based gang. Police said a witness to the shooting heard <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> say `` I'll make rank, man, I'll make rank'' as he fired the shots, apparently referring to a hoped-for advancement Police would not identify the witness. The confrontation was the latest in a series of run-ins between <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> and the Black Guerrilla Family, police said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was a person the BGF felt had crossed them. He had robbed and stolen dope from members of the BGF in the past,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> homicide Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>. Through a spokesman, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s family declined to comment Saturday on the arrest. At the time of his death, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Frederika </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, had lived in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. The family prepared for Monday's funeral at <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Organizers said they expect 2,000 mourners, including Black Panther co-founder <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, at the service. A public viewing also was planned at an Oakland mortuary on Sunday. Meanwhile, the site on a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> street where the slaying occurred has become something of a shrine. Supporters have placed wreaths and flowers and lit candles on the sidewalk in the drug-infested neighborhood where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>' minister of defense, established programs for poor blacks two decades ago. Police said Friday they believe <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and entered a hospital treatment program in 1984, had been using cocaine Monday night and early Tuesday.

 It could be tough to find a tow truck in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Sunday, unless the breakdown is somewhere between the <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> and the Rocky Point amusement park. Tow truck drivers and rigs from nine states are scheduled to parade between the two sites, hoping to gain a little more respect from drivers who equate calling a tow truck with visiting the dentist for root canal work. `` It's basically an awareness thing,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> of <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. His East Greenwich company is a major-league towing operation with 10 trucks that can handle everything from Volkswagens to buses. `` Sure, you say, ` I do n't get enough respect' for the work you do. We do too,'' <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> said. `` People ridicule us a lot in tough situations.'' <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> presides over the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> this year and decided it was time to show off. When the association shifted its annual family outing from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> farm to Rocky Point, he said he thought of the parade, something towing associations in other states also have done. <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> said he expects nearly 100 gleaming trucks with their lights flashing and uniformed drivers to roll along in formation. `` A lot of people do n't realize how sophisticated our business has become,'' <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> said. `` As cars have become more sophisticated, so has our equipment. ... There are no hooks on tow trucks anymore.'' The new gentler tow truck now uses a sling that slides under the wheels and lets a car ride on its own suspension, he said. A small towing rig can cost $ 35,000, he said. And the price of some of the larger ones? If you have to ask, you ca n't afford it. `` We want the people to realize that we are not putting the money under our mattresses. We're spending it on men and equipment,'' he said. The towing association has 85 members out of about 110 licensed towers in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, but all this sophistication should mean that motorists wo n't have to steam on the highway while the tow drivers enjoy a clambake. `` We all have radios nowadays, and cellular phones. Everybody's in touch,'' <PERSON> Pucino </PERSON> said `` So hopefully we'll be able to provide the service on Sunday.''

<HEAD>Huge, Vaguely Authentic Cattle Drive to Mark Montana Centennial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 What started as the nostalgic whimsy of three friends has become a corporate extravaganza of 3,000 real and fancied cowpokes, 300 covered wagons and 4,000 cattle that will roll across <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> next month. It's an <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> cattle drive like the Old West never saw, a state-sanctioned event to celebrate <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s 100th anniversary in a vaguely authentic re-creation of the days of the open range. Cold beer and entertainment every night. And no rustlers. The Great <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centennial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> is just one of scores of events sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, but it stands alone for its grandiose scope, gaudy exuberance and big-time price tag. Officials of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Latigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, established to organize the drive, estimate the cost at anywhere from $ 400,000 to $ 1 million, depending on variables such as the fees for country-western talent who will entertain at the wagon train each night. Grammy Award winner <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> headlines the final concert in Billings Sept. 9. The drive begins on Labor Day at the little town of Roundup, chosen as the origin partly for its name. It will roll southward 60 miles in a leisurely six days, from the banks of the <LOCATION> Musselshell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, through the <LOCATION> Bull </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, across the prairie, ending near the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at the livestock auctions of Billings. That's about the same pace as the cattle drives of 100 years ago. About 100 drovers _ experienced cowhands _ have been hired to drive the main herd and a separate lead herd of some 300 longhorns. The wagon train will follow with its mixture of dudes, nostalgists and adventurers, ranging from celebrities such as television magnate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to would-be westerners from as far away as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The youngest drover is 13-year-old <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> of Billings, who has worked cattle since he was 2. `` This drive will not be of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> cowboy school, but rather a 1989 drive which will honor and pay tribute to all the great drives of the past,'' said western cartoonist <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynde </PERSON>, an originator of the idea. Billings officials will close some streets for the herd when it arrives, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 87 south of Roundup will be closed to traffic for two days. `` It is a federal route, but this is an extraordinary event,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, division administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` There has never been a cattle drive like this.'' The basic plan, as conceived by cartoonists <PERSON> Lynde </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> McWilliams </PERSON> and a friend, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wempner </PERSON>, was to re-create an old-time drive and let the public help drive the cattle to market, then sell the herd and go home. It sounded so simple. The original goal was 10,000 cattle and 5,000 riders, but that proved too ambitious a goal for the drive, which, for a time, bogged down in logistics and personalities and almost died. Some of the financing and organization show ingenious modern twists. When <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> brought the first great herd from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in 1866, he paid the cowboys to help him, as Latigo is paying the drovers. But the non-professional riders who want to come on the centennial drive are paying Latigo _ $ 130 to $ 150 for meal tickets, plus $ 25 to feed their horses _ and contributing a cow to the herd, besides. If they do n't have a cow, Latigo will rent them one. Same with the horses. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> hired a cook. Latigo hired two catering companies. And in 1866, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> never told his cowboys to bring sunblock and bug spray. Though authenticity is not a major goal of the celebration, participants are not allowed to wear baseball-style caps, tennis shoes or bright-colored jeans. Backpacker tents will be allowed only if their colorful modern fabric is hidden by plain canvas. Any profit from the drive will go to a fund to provide scholarships for rural <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> youngsters and economic development projects. Two foundations have pledged $ 2 million in matching funds. Other money-making devices include sale of licenses to identify products with the drive, an auction of donated art and Western items and the country-western concert.

 Rebels attacked a southern town but were repelled by government forces, an official report said Saturday. It said at least 19 people were killed. About 200 rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> launched the attack Thursday on <PERSON> Macia </PERSON>, about 55 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, according to the government news agency AIM. At least 12 rebels and seven civilians were killed before government troops forced the guerrillas to retreat, AIM said, citing the <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION>. The report said nothing of government casualties. Noticias also reported that other people were killed by rebels who overran the central town of <LOCATION> Laubo </LOCATION> on Aug. 19. It did not say exactly how many people died. The rebels have been fighting since 1977 to undermine <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s leftist government. No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, who have devastated <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s economy with hit-and-run attacks on civilian and military targets. Rebel leaders and Mozambican clergymen representing the government of President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> this month for preliminary peace talks, but no agreements were reported.

 Police on Saturday detained 15 ultra-Orthodox Jews on suspicion of attacking cars driven by secular Jews in a mostly religious <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhood, a spokesman said. The ultra-Orthodox Jews were protesting what they consider a violation of the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest lasting from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday. Jewish religious laws forbid any work or money transactions on Sabbath, and driving a car is considered a form of work. Police said 150 to 200 ultra-Orthodox Jews blocked the streets and attacked motorists in <LOCATION> Har </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nof </LOCATION> neighborhood. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox families populate Har Nof, which also is home to several hundred secular families. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON> said 15 ultra-Orthodox suspected of disturbing public order and an illegal gathering were detained. Six were teen-agers and three were released after questioning, he said. The last major wave of ultra-Orthodox protests in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was in December 1987, when hundreds of religious Jews demonstrated every Saturday against movie theaters and other entertainment spots operating on Sabbath.

<TEXT>
 To the somber cadence of muffled drums, an estimated 35,000 people marched Saturday upon the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to protest what <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> called `` the legal lynching of black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hope ... to become full partners in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream.'' The march, aimed at spurring legislative `` remedies'' for four recent civil rights decisions by the high court, was fashioned in tone and dress after the historic `` Silent March'' 72 years ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As then, men wore black and women and children wore white; as then, the marchers kept their lips sealed throughout the procession. The 1917 march of 8,000 people, led by W.E.B. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON>, down Fifth Avenue elevated the 8-year-old National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to the forefront of the then-fledgling civil rights movement. Saturday's event, which drew nearly every major civil rights leader in the nation, may have restored that standing for an organization which lately has been criticized within the black community as staid and ineffective. `` For an organization that's dead, we did pretty good, did n't we? beamed Hooks as he looked upon the throng which gathered at the East Front of the Capitol for a rally after the silent march. Hooks claimed a turnout of 135,000 people; police estimates were far smaller. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police put the number of marchers at 35,000; the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol police said the crowd at the rally was 18,500. More than 200 civic, church and labor organizations had joined the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in sponsoring the march. Individuals joining Hooks on the speaker's dais included the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sourthern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Height </PERSON>, president of the Black Leadership Forum, and dozens of others. `` We come, presenting our bodies in silent protest, in a manner used in 1917 to protest the brutal lynching of black Americans in this nation,'' said Hooks. `` It is ironic that 72 years later, we find ourselves marching once more to protest the legal lynching of black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hope for a chance to become full partners in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. `` The five justices who voted on four separate occasions to roll back the clock on civil rights, by their actions, have unraveled the ropes used by black Americans to climb out of the valleys of economic segregation.'' In the view of civil rights lawyers, the four decisions this year seriously cut into the modern legal gains of minorities, particularly employment rights. In one case, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the court sharply limited the power of minority men and women to sue private parties, including schools, for discrimatory practices. Similarly, the court's decision in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> vs. J. <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was seen as diluting job set-aside programs _ guaranteeing certain percentages of municipal projects to minority subcontractors _ and other affirmative action plans. March organizers also assailed the decision in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilks </PERSON>, which allowed white firefighters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to attack a consent decree calling for the promotion of blacks as a case of `` reverse discrimination.'' The fourth ruling, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Cove vs. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, was criticized as shifting the entire burden of proof in job discrimination cases to the victims of employer bias. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told the rally at the Capitol that `` the unions march today because we believe discrimination can not be eradicated from our society until there is equal employment opportunity for all Americans.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has often been the target of major demonstrations in the capital in recent years. An estimated 325,000 turned out last spring to urge the court to stand by its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. However, the court weeks later softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for anti-abortion forces.

 Polls published Saturday indicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s constituents still strongly support him despite revelations about the congressman's relationship with a male prostitute. The state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, called for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat's resignation. But political observers predicted <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in 1987, would survive the scandal. On Friday, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 49, acknowledged he had once paid for sex with a man he identified as <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, then hired him as a personal aide in an effort to wean him from a life of drugs and prostitution. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he fired <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> when he became suspicious that the man was selling sex from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Capitol Hill apartment. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he had been `` victimized'' and predicted voters would not hold the incident against him. The polls _ and a tradition of tolerance in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ appear to back him up. A poll of 400 registered voters in <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s district conducted Friday night for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> showed 65.3 percent did not think <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> should resign, while 22.3 percent did. About 12 percent had no opinion or refused to answer. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WCVB-TV </ORGANIZATION> polled 300 of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s constituents, and 56 percent said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has `` performed well enough as a congressman to deserve re-election'' while 29 percent called for his ouster. Five percent said their view depends on who opposes <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in 1990. Both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent. After publicly acknowledging his homosexuality, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> won election to his fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote in the state's 4th District, encompassing some <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburbs and parts of southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` It would be worse if it were some kind of a money scandal. His sex life is well known, so it came as no surprise,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freysigner </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haverhill </LOCATION>. The only other member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to publicly acknowlege being a homosexual is Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, also a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat. <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> easily won re-election after being censured by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 for an affair 10 years earlier with a 17-year-old male House page. The state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> urged <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to resign, charging he `` violated the law,'' `` lied about the situation'' and showed a `` profound lack of judgment.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, the party's executive director, said he believes voters `` will absolutely object to <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> when they find out he has been using his public position to help a prostitute, drug dealer and convicted felon.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> had been convicted of obscenity, sex and drug charges. But <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosso </PERSON>, a congressional scholar at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s admissions likely would not affect his reputation as an effective lawmaker. `` Power on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is based on two things: seniority and support from the voters,'' <PERSON> Bosso </PERSON> said. `` Barney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is smart, even those who disagree with him realize he's one of the smartest members on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.''

 The body of a young Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities was found Saturday hanging by the neck in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> orange grove, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. In other developments, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed a 17-year-old Palestinian youth and raided several villages in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The soldiers also battled Palestinian youths who built makeshift barricades in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and hurled stones from rooftops, the reports said. In other scattered clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, seven Palestinians were shot and wounded by army troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. The wounded included a 13-year-old boy with a gunshot in the neck. The body of <LOCATION> Amen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tayem </LOCATION>, 20, was found in an orange grove in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said. They said <PERSON> Tayem </PERSON> was last seen being led out of his <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> home by a group of masked Palestinians two days ago. They attributed the killing to `` security reasons,'' suggesting he was killed as a suspected collaborator. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio explicitly identified the man as a suspected collaborator. It said he was beaten to death, and his body was later tied to the electricity pole. An army spokesman confirmed the killing and said the motive was apparently criminal. However, victims hanged in public places have generally been suspected collaborators. A police spokesman declined comment. A total of 98 Palestinians have been slain by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as suspected collaborators during the 20-month Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> claimed the majority of the victims had no links to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At least 548 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians in the uprising. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in the violence. In the village of Deir es-Sudan near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, an army patrol was attacked by stone-throwing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths, an army spokesman said, and an officer opened fire, fatally wounding a 17-year-old Arab. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio identified the youth as <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Adjadji </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists said soldiers raided at least three other villages in the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> area to arrest suspected uprising ringleaders. The army on Saturday also clamped a curfew on the village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, after villagers burned several houses owned by a suspected <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> collaborator, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Arab journalists said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers raided at least three villages in the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> area Saturday to search for suspected leaders of the uprising. During the one-hour clash in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths blocked the street with stone barricades, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said. The protesters also burned tires and threw stones at soldiers from rooftops, they said. Troops responded with gunfire from observation posts atop buildings, the journalists said. The former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> governor, reserve Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON>, said Saturday that unless peace efforts progressed, `` negative processes in the field would strengthen and the radical voices.. would also increase. `` Their policy may become more tough, and they would issue more radical orders. In the field, people would spontaneously take more desperate and therefore more dangerous and violent actions,'' <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio.

 Rescuers in airplanes and on foot searched the icy peaks and steep valleys of the Himalayas Saturday for a <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> plane that disappeared with 54 people on a domestic flight. Dozens of relatives of the 49 passengers and five crew gathered at <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the air force are operating a joint search command for the propeller-driven <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 27 that disappeared early Friday. Five helicopters, two <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> air force C-130 transports and two of the airline's planes searched the rugged northern mountains Saturday, officials said. They were set to resume Sunday. `` We have n't got any indication yet of anything,'' said airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Azra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>. `` We have flown 11 search sorties today and the search parties are still on the ground since yesterday.'' Poor weather hampered the initial search Friday as clouds dipped below the 15,000-foot mountain peaks where the Himalayas meet the equally lofty Korakoram range. Pilots reported better visibility Saturday. The missing plane took off from the mountain resort of <LOCATION> Gilgit </LOCATION> for the 45-minute flight to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, 175 miles south. Airline officials said the last communication from the pilot was a routine position check seven minutes into the flight.

<TEXT>
 A newly restored version of <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON>'s 1938 film classic, `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevsky </PERSON>,'' is wowing audiences on a world tour that its producer hopes will carry it triumphantly back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` I'd love to take this film home to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' said producer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON>, who said he is awaiting an overture from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The first performance would knock them out. They'd be beside themselves.'' Besides <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON>'s dramatic black-and-white photography, the screen epic about the 13th century defeat of marauding Teutonic armies by Russian forces led by <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevsky </PERSON> features a rousing musical score by composer <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>. A fresh print of <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON>'s 107-minute movie, made from the original nitrate negative in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> film archive, was prepared for <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON>'s `` concert presentation'' Saturday night at the outdoor theater of <ORGANIZATION> Wolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. While shown on a 30-foot screen over the stage, with English subtitles displayed on a smaller screen underneath, <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>'s music was to be performed in sync with the film by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a chorus from the <ORGANIZATION> Oratorio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> The film has two tracks for remastered dialogue and sound effects, a computer slide track for subtitles and a fourth track that feeds cues to the orchestra conductor. `` The print is so gorgeous, it just glows,'' <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON> said. `` It will make you fall in love with black-and-white film all over again.'' The music was another matter. <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON> described the faint, scratchy soundtrack of the original film, performed by a 30-member studio band, in one word: `` horrible.'' `` The orchestra was clearly having a bad day with one of the greatest film scores ever written,'' he said during a break in rehearsals at the Kennedy Center. Shortly after <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> completed the 60-minute movie score, he condensed it into his widely performed, 40-minute `` Alexander Nevsky Cantata'' for mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra. Copies of the original movie score are lost. So <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON> recruited musical arranger <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brohn </PERSON> to transcribe the missing 20 minutes of music from the original soundtrack for full orchestra, using the cantata as a framework. `` We knocked ourselves out to make this music authentic,'' <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON> said. `` We even left in Prokofiev's obvious mistakes. We took the film and added the music we think is what <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> heard in his head. It is fair to say that almost every note is by <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON>, who also has produced the award-winning `` Live From Lincoln Center'' broadcasts for public television, said performances of `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevsky </PERSON>'' are booked through next year at the <LOCATION> Pompeii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The restored version premiered in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in November 1987, and came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after enthusiastic receptions in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON> is reported to have made the film about <PERSON> Nevsky </PERSON>, a legendary Russian hero, because he had fallen into disfavor and needed a popular hit that would please Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his cultural bureaucrats. For his part, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> embraced `` Nevsky'' as a valuable piece of artistic propaganda to mobilize the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people against a threatened invasion by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The movie was shelved after the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact was signed in 1939 but was eagerly shown after the Germans invaded two years later. For his efforts, <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON> was awarded the Order of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and slapped on the back from <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who reportedly exclaimed, `` <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailovich </PERSON>, you are a good Bolshevik after all!'' <PERSON> Goberman </PERSON> rejects the notion that `` Nevsky'' is esoteric art or a mere Stalinist propaganda vehicle. `` This is a popular film, made for audiences to enjoy,'' he said. `` This is cowboys and Indians, only they're Russians and Germans. It was made to get audiences excited, and it really does.''

<TEXT>
 A couple was arrested early Saturday surrounded by what one officer called `` enough money to bathe in'' and charged with running an operation that transported nearly $ 350 million to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Posada </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Deysi </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, were arrested shortly after midnight at their residence in <LOCATION> Roslyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON>, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Both were charged with money laundering and conspiracy. Mrs. <PERSON> Posada </PERSON> is additionally charged with making false statements for giving police a phony name, <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> said. The couple was held without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Facility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> pending a hearing Thursday. An infant believed to be their child was taken from the home and placed in the custody of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Services, he said. He said $ 4 million in $ 10 and $ 20 bills and a money rolling device were confiscated during the arrest. No drugs were found in the apartment. `` The place is covered with money. There's enough money here to bathe in. You could actually fill up your entire pool,'' he said. `` We believe it came from drug sales, but we have n't gotten that far into the investigation.'' The arrests came after a week-long probe by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> police. A federal search warrant was issued Friday night in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The couple allegedly had been laundering between $ 48 million and $ 50 million per year for the past seven years to the Colombia-based <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest cocaine selling operation, <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> said. The investigation began with the arrest of a courier with $ 250,000 in his luggage who was attempting to fly to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON>. He said the operation employed an average of 16 couriers a month, each carrying over $ 250,000 in their suitcases. The bags, some weighing more than 100 pounds, were filled with money-lined lightbulbs, bug spray cans and toys. They were checked in at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and shipped directly to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> for pickup, <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> said. The arrests coincide with a major offensive by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government against drug traffickers. On Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent the government $ 65 million in emergency drug-fighting aid, including helicopters, assault vehicles and small arms.

 An army unit and a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group drew guns when they met in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but decided to hold an informal half-hour peace parley that included an exchange of cigarettes. It was the first known talks between Sandinista army and Contra groups since the signing of a regional accord signed this month in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel force. An army unit commanded by Lt. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> nearly ran into the Contra group on a dirt road near the Honduran border Thursday afternoon, said photographer <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, the only journalist present. `` <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> shouted for everybody to hit the dirt, but at the same time he was yelling at the Contras that he did not want any shooting,'' <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said. `` The Contras were yelling the same thing: that nobody wanted to shoot, just talk. Those were pretty tense moments.'' Eventually, after placing safety catches on weapons, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and the leader of the guerrilla squad, <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, apparently convinced each other of their good intentions. `` The decisive point in lowering the tension was when the Sandinista soldiers started offering cigarettes to the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, who was working for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` From there on, the two sides sort of mingled _ still being careful, though _ and started talking to each other in small groups.'' Rebel commander <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> `` Wilmer'' <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> had requested a meeting Thursday morning with a Saninista unit near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manchones </LOCATION>, about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, but his detachment failed to show up, <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said. The 20 government troopers then moved north. They ran into the 30 Contras several hours later at a bend of the road. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said the 30-minute meeting ended with <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> telling <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> that he would consult with <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> and other superiors about accepting amnesty and promising to make contact again next week. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> gave the Contras copies of the accord to dismantle the Contras signed Aug. 7 in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group established at the behest of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents is to oversee the dismantling and repatriation or relocation, an operation that should begin within two weeks and be completed by Dec. 5. Most Contras _ an estimated 10,000 _ have been encamped in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border since their leaders signed a temporary cease-fire with the Nicaraguan government in March 1988. But pockets of Contras remain in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and in central Chontales province staging scattered attacks. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> commands the Sandinista army `` <LOCATION> Quilali </LOCATION>'' reserve battallion of the 311th Brigade. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> heads a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> batallion also called `` <LOCATION> Quilali </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Quilali </LOCATION> is the name of a town in <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION> province, and the meeting took place about six miles north of the town. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said the Contras appeared to know little of the regional accord, which <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> explained to them. After <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> distributed the copies of the accord, the Contras left, looking over their shoulders as they disappeared into the bush. Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, on Saturday said more than 400 Contras have left their camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and are trying to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The daily quoted <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Umanzor </PERSON>, whom it described a seven-year Contra veteran, as saying more than 400 rebels had deserted and were wandering around the border trying to enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> through the Nicaraguan border town of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manos </LOCATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> Nueva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Segovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday, according to <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has set up border offices to receive Nicaraguans who want to return.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> couple who survived 66 days aboard a life raft in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> returned home Saturday looking for a long rest _ away from the water and their aquatic tormentors. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 59, and <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 56, arrived at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a seven-week ordeal, during which they said their boat was sunk by whales and they had to fend off sharks and subsist on fresh fish and desalinated sea water. The couple, each more than 50 pounds lighter after the ordeal, flew from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, a week after they were rescued by a <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter 13 miles off that Central American nation's coast. `` It's hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift, trying to make landfall,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` Really, it's hard to discuss the situation.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the most dangerous day on the covered raft was a day he called `` The Shootout at O.K. Corral.'' The Butlers that afternoon found themselves in the middle of a huge school of triggerfish, a small feeding fish. Then came a school of porpoises and `` about 20 to 30 sharks,'' he said. `` They all got in a huge feeding frenzy,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said, that ended only about 3 a.m. the next day. During the turbulent episode, either a porpoise or a shark got caught in one of the raft's balast bags, and violently threw the raft about for a couple of minutes, according to <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a retired exporter, looked trim and fit. He wore a bushy gray beard grown during the sojourn. Mrs. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who lost 67 pounds, left the plane in a wheelchair, but stood up to greet waiting family members and friends and talk with reporters. Among those waiting to meet the Butlers was their 2-month-old granddaughter, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who was born after they put to sea. The couple was hospitalized in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> after the rescue. `` The first night in the hospital,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, `` I had a terrible nightmare, and did n't know where I was. It was a terrible two minutes in the dark before I realized that I was on land and it was all right.'' On May 24, the Butlers began a voyage from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in their 40-foot sailboat. Nearly three weeks out, whales, apparently seeking to protect their young, attacked and sank the boat, the couple said. ` I do n't know anything about whale psychology,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said, `` but I assume we headed into -LRB- the whales' -RRB- pack. The babies were in front, the mothers behind, then the males.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the male whales attacked the boat, ramming its hull while making loud chugging sounds `` like a locomotive.'' The couple sent help signals, grabbed essentials and jumped into the raft as the craft went down in minutes. They managed to escape with six cans of food _ including half a jar of peanut butter _ the ship's log, a puncture repair kit for the rubber raft and the crucial fishing line and a portable desalination filter. The canned food held out for 20 days, then they lived on fish they caught. The couple said they sighted dozens of ships during their ordeal, but were n't seen by the crews. The <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spotted the couple floating in their life raft Aug. 19. `` We're going to rest _ and go away from the ocean for a while, to the mountains, the prairies,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. The life-long sailor said he plans to resume sailing `` in about a year.'' They said they have received various offers for rights to the story of their ordeal. `` We've already received a lot of offers,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` Offers for movie rights, for TV rights, for book rights, for ghostwriters.'' But `` we've put that all on hold,'' his wife said.

<HEAD>Pravda Slams Unofficial Soviet Press, Says Polish Communists Not
Through</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pravda on Saturday accused several unofficial newspapers that have sprung up under Kremlin reforms of using Western funds to press for the overthrow of the Soviet government. In another attack on liberal trends, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily also warned Poles that Polish Communists may have suffered a defeat, but nobody should write their political obituary. Pravda called for a crackdown on publications that carry `` systematic and vicious attacks on our party and its leadership.'' Among targets of Pravda's censure were papers put out by the self-styled opposition party <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an independent Siberian news agency and unofficial journalists <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>. Their press activities, which once would have brought them constant harassment and arrests, have flourished despite continuing obstacles under the Kremlin's policy of glasnost, or more openness. Commentator <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhukov </PERSON> listed among his complaints against the activist journalists `` truly blasphemous attacks on <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>,'' including pornographic verses. He denounced cooperation between unofficial journalists and Western radio and press, saying their Western support made them the equivalent of foreign publications put out without permission on Soviet territory. <PERSON> Zhukov </PERSON> also accused many of the unofficial publications of pirating their paper supplies and the use of copying facilities. Under a law passed July 31, calls for the violent overthrow of the Soviet government are criminal offenses. An earlier version also banned statements that `` discredited'' the government, but it was replaced. On <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prava </PERSON> said `` extremist-minded people are hurrying to write off the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- communist -RRB- Party'' following the election of Soldarity member <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as Polish prime minister. The newspaper cautioned that discounting the Communists would be premature, Pravda cautioned. It said the Communists by right are the most important group in Polish politics. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election Thursday, with support from many Communist lawmakers, gave the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc is first non-Communist leader since World War II. The Soviet government sent an immediate telegram of congratulations to <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. But Pravda's commentary, the most authoritative to date, cast doubt on whether <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> can succeed in breaking <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic decline. `` Is this the way out of the labyrinth?'' the newspaper asked. It never really answered the question.

Actor-filmmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, who co-sponsored the four-day conference with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, read a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> are the two largest producers of greenhouse gases'' thought to cause global warming, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said. `` We should provide the leadership in the search for common solutions to the global warming problem as well as for the environmental security of the world.'' The letter was signed by <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> and space researcher <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Segdeev </PERSON>, head of an 11-member Soviet delegation, who said the two nations must cooperate to undo the environmental damage they have incurred. `` For the crimes we've committed, as humans on the planet, we are sentenced to do this job. And I think it is a life-long sentence,'' <PERSON> Segdeev </PERSON> said. His comments ended the conference of Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> scientists, political leaders, environmentalists, filmmakers and authors. Among those attending were Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo.; <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>; astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>; and cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>. The attempt at `` greenhouse glasnost'' was not as much a scientific conference as it was an attempt to `` pass the baton'' from scientists to policy-shapers in both countries, who need to take action, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said. During the conference, scientists predicted that the greenhouse effect, caused by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other gases produced by industrial societies, could raise global temperatures by 2 to 10 degrees over the next century. That could alter worldwide weather patterns and cause the melting of the polar ice caps, flooding coastal regions. To combat the rise of carbon dioxide, much of which comes from the burning of fossil fuels, the letter proposes the two superpowers form an `` environmental security alliance'' to: _ Promote energy-efficient technology _ Halt production and use by the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons, another group of greenhouse gases, and `` substantially reduce'' carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases _ Reduce the rate of worldwide deforestation and start the planting of trees in unforested areas The letter was accompanied by a conference report detailing specific strategies for reducing global warming. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Redford </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental mediation group based at his Sundance resort in central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, has tackled offshore drilling in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the construction of power plants in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and air quality issues.

 A fire broke out in the stairwell of a suburban hotel and spread through the top floor of the four-story building, killing seven guests and injuring 17, police said Saturday. Three people burned to death and four fell to their deaths after jumping out of windows to escape the flames, a fire department official said. Four guests of the Hotel Hennouf Gouta de Clichy in the northwest suburb of <LOCATION> Clichy </LOCATION> were seriously burned and taken to a nearby hospital, the official said. Thirteen others suffered minor smoke inhalation, the official said on condition of anonymity. Firefighters brought the blaze under control about 1 a.m. Saturday, about two hours after it started, said the official. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. No Americans were believed to be staying at the hotel, most of whose guests are African immigrant workers.

 The B-2 stealth bomber ended the longest and most secretive of its three test flights over the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> on Saturday with a safe landing here, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. The bat-like bomber took off at 8:30 a.m. from <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and landed at 1:06 p.m., four hours and 36 minutes later, said Capt. <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON>, program director for B-2 <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> called the bomber's third flight a success. `` We are extremely pleased with today's mission,'' <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said in a statement. The B-2's flight Saturday `` was by far the longest, highest and fastest'' thus far, said <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>. The aircraft flew at 25,000 feet and at speeds of up to 300 knots, or about 345 miles per hour, she said. In the previous two flights, the bomber never exceeded a height of 10,000 feet, a speed of 180 knots or two hours in the air. `` The primary mission was to check out the systems and see how it flies,'' she said. `` That's what test flights are for, to go a little bit higher, fly a little bit faster.'' As in the earlier test flights, the bomber was piloted by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> chief test pilot <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>. She did not have any other details about the flight from the desert air base 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The second test flight of the radar-evading B-2 on Aug. 16 was cut short in midflight because of a hairline crack in the casing of an accessory drive. The part powers the $ 530 million jet's generators and controls and caused oil pressure to drop, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said Friday The bomber's two-hour maiden flight earlier this summer was termed a success. Unlike the previous two test flights, the Saturday flight was not announced in advance by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The government has spent about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has balked at the thought of paying more than $ 500 million apiece for 132 bombers. Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> last month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants $ 4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal year, and it may need $ 8 billion in each of the three years of peak production, from 1992 to 1994. Engineers say that the use of composite materials, combined with the bomber's shape and smooth leading edges, give it a tiny radar signature, making it nearly impossible for current Soviet systems to detect.

 A jury Saturday began deliberating the fate of <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who is accused of avoiding taxes by charging personal expenses to her hotel business. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court jury, which received the case after a two-month trial at which 48 witnesses testified, deliberated more than eight hours before breaking for the day. The jurors, who are sequestered, planned to return at 10:30 a.m. Sunday. Soon after they began deliberations, jury foreman <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a postal worker, sent out a note asking for 11 copies of the judge's instruction on the law and the `` court journal. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had already given them one copy of the charge, which he had read to them Friday, refused to supply them with more. He explained that jurors should do their thinking as a whole and that he did not want individual jurors reading from different parts of his instructions. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also declined to give them the court journal, which he deduced was the entire trial transcript. He told the jurors that they would have to ask for testimony from specific witnesses or about specific issues. Later, they sent another note asking for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' personal tax returns for 1983-85 and a folder of all the records of money spent on the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> estate, <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. The jurors also asked for documents pertaining to the moving expenses of the former houskeeper at the estate, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>. The government contends that her moving costs, almost $ 4,000, were paid for by the Park Lane Hotel. During the deliberations, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> chatted with her lawyers and the reporters covering the trial. She appeared relaxed and smiled frequently. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, has been on trial for eight weeks on charges she evaded $ 1.2 million in federal taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations at her <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> estate, to her businesses. Former aides <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, who are co-defendants at the trial, are charged with assisting in the scheme.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s second statewide crack crackdown this summer captured more than 2,100 suspects _ from teen-agers to an 82-year-old man _ and more than doubled the number of crack rocks confiscated, authorities said Saturday. The greater quantity of crack seized in `` Operation Rock Pile II'' indicates police arrested more dealers than in the first roundup, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said. An estimated 1,200 officers in all of the state's 67 counties arrested 2,117 suspects during the 48 hours ending midnight Friday, compared with 2,076 arrests in the two-day operation begun June 30. The second roundup produced 9,507 crack cocaine `` rocks'' _ individual chunks of crack ready for smoking _ as well as 2.73 pounds of cocaine powder, 12.72 pounds of marijuana, 75 firearms, 327 vehicles and more than $ 70,000 in cash, <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said by telephone from the operation command post in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. The first `` Operation Rock Pile'' netted 3,510 crack cocaine rocks, 10 pounds of cocaine powder, 3 pounds of marijuana, 50 firearms, 327 vehicles and $ 55,000 cash. The operations' main objective was to `` get as much crack off the street as we can,'' said another sheriff's spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leljedal </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcher </PERSON>, 82, was among those arrested, <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilcher </PERSON>, who had a substantial amount of crack rocks, cash and several firearms in his house, was charged with trafficking in cocaine, and could face a life sentence if convicted, <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said. `` It's an enticement to all members of our society, the lure of easy money from the sale of crack rocks,'' said <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>. The crackdown, coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, combined reverse sting and `` Trojan Horse'' operations with search warrants and highway surveillance. Undercover officers in reverse stings pose as drug sellers and arrest customers. In `` Trojan Horse'' operations, deputies hidden in the back of a van jump out and arrest street corner dealers when they offer crack for sale to the van's driver.

<TEXT>
 Roman Catholic Primate <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> on Saturday urged Jews worldwide to stop being anti-Polish in his first comment on the controversy surrounding a convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp. `` Let us start a dialogue in honesty and in truth,'' said <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` If there would be no ` anti-Polonism,' there will be no anti-Semitism in our country.'' He spoke to thousands of pilgrims at <LOCATION> Jasna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION> in the southern city of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> on the holiday honoring the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most revered Catholic icon. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> was responding to international criticism of the church's Aug. 10 abrogation of a 1987 promise to move the convent from the perimeter of the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> camp Many Jewish groups consider the convent an intrusion at the site where more than 2.5 million Jews were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Three million of the 3.5 million Jews in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at World War II were killed in the Holocaust. Most survivors fled immediately after and in another wave after a government-led anti-Semitic purge in 1968, leaving the Jewish population here today at only several thousand. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, in coments reported by the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> state news agency, said: `` Have there been animosities and adventures against Jews in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>? Yes, there have. Have there been Jews in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, businessmen, who neglected and detested Poles? Yes. Were there Jewish collaborators during the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- occupation who did not grow into the heroic defenders of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto? Yes.'' He also noted Jews were among Polish soldiers killed at the siege of <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cassino </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The brotherhood of common martyrdom has extraordinary significance ... So why has the problem of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and the convent of the Carmelite nuns been born? Why has it exploded so suddenly 40 years after putting out the crematoria?'' he asked. `` Dialogue is needed ... The systematic explanation of difficult things, not of putting forth demands,'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said. `` The Carmelite nuns living beside the camp site in <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION> wanted and want to be a symbol of the human solidarity which covers the living and the dead. `` Ca n't you see, dear Jews, that acting against them offends the feelings of all Poles and our sovereignty ... `` Your power is the mass media at easy disposal in many countries. Do n't let them serve to kindle anti-Polonism.'' Referring to seven American Jews who climbed a fence at the convent July 14 and occupied the convent yard before being roughly dragged out by workmen, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said, `` Do n't call the -LRB- Jewish -RRB- assailants heroes.'' He also urged Jews to distinguish between the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp, where he said mainly Poles were killed, and the nearby <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> camp, run from a Nazi headquarters at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, where mainly Jews died.

 Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny `` moonlets'' hidden in one of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s two brightest rings, and also found three more rings orbiting the planet, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up 78 percent of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is present as well, they said. By 9 a.m. PDT Sunday, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will be 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Voyager traveled a curving 4.43-billion-mile path to achieve Thursday night's close encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and Friday morning's flight past <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have five rings at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>,'' including the two bright ones found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said later the boundaries between the five rings are n't well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as five He reversed himself later Saturday, deciding the rings are distinct enough to count the total as five. A bright ring discovered Aug. 11 initially appeared to be a partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring. Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12 miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others. So far, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> has discovered six objects orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> that are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight moons, including <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were discovered from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The ring containing the moonlets remains <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s outermost ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring, followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band of dust <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said was 1,550 miles wide. The initial confusion over the number of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s rings is reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in 1986. Ten thin rings were apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing how many distinct rings orbit Uranus. Researchers said Saturday that <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> also found: _ <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates Earth's magnetic axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one magnetic pole in northern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> about 1,000 miles from the true, or rotational, north pole. _ The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> belts encircling <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> The radiation belt's location near the orbit of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> may explain the pinkish hue of some of the moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas that color. Deputy Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> said there is evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south latitude, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> has an aurora similar to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights. Other scientists Saturday refused to discuss the evidence, saying it was too preliminary. If the aurora proves real, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s tilted magnetic field would explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's equator rather than the rotational poles Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth, they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational poles are relatively close. Voyager continued Saturday to send back recorded photographs taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed photos of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global temperature map of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, search for auroras and more rings, and study the weight of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look back at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Then it will head toward interstellar space, looking for the edge of the solar system.

 Voyager 2's <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> encounter marks the last planetary flyby by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spacecraft, but missions to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> mean <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will keep exploring space, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday. `` We are embarking on the second golden age of space science,'' said <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, the agency's associate administrator for space science and applications. `` What's coming up is an era of unprecedented excitement and activity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plans to launch 35 space science flights in the next five years _ the highest launch rate ever _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spacecraft will be exploring planets continuously from next year until 2006, <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said during a visit to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> was at the lab to watch Voyager 2's brush with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> last Thursday night _ the probe's final encounter after it explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. `` In many ways, this is the end of an era, the last time we will see a planet for a first time, the end of the reconnaissance phase of planetary explorations,'' he said. There are no plans to explore Pluto, the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft But <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> listed several missions that will orbit planets rather than fly past them: _ <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, launched from a space shuttle last May, arrives at <LOCATION> Venus </LOCATION> next August and will study that planet for several years _ <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will be launched from the shuttle <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> on Oct. 12, arriving in orbit around Jupiter in 1996 and studying the planet until the end of the century _ The <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> is due for launch from a shuttle next March, and is so powerful that from its orbit around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> it will be able to `` observe the universe back to the beginning of time,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said _ Mars Observer will be launched in 1992, reaching the red planet in 1993 and studying it until 1996 _ <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve the Comet Rendevous-Asteroid Flyby and <ORGANIZATION> Cassini </ORGANIZATION> missions, <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CRAF </ORGANIZATION> would fly past an asteroid, then orbit a comet from 2000 through 2002, <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. The similar spacecraft on the <ORGANIZATION> Cassini </ORGANIZATION> mission would drop a probe onto <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Titan, then orbit <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> from 2002 through 2006. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will suffer financially because of the shuttle program, saying that 70 percent to 80 percent of non-military shuttle flights will be dedicated to space science. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said space science studies suffered in recent years not from a lack of funds, but because of delays in developing the shuttle and the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and halted launches until last fall.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 14-party opposition coalition on Saturday announced a platform for February elections focusing on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic crisis but offering no details of a promised austerity budget. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> also promised legal title to peasants given land under Sandinista agrarian reforms and compensation for those whose land was confiscated. It pledges several improved social programs but does not mention the tough measures any <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> government would need to take to halt inflation and increase production. A coalition `` Government of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION>'' would institute an austerity budget, the platform says without detailing specifics. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s Sandinista government already is taking some measures. In January, it fired 30,000 public employees, cut its budget by more than 40 percent and slashed investments to combat inflation that topped 33,000 percent last year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have failed to create a climate of confidence in the private sector to encourage production. Confiscating land as punishment for political opposition is among Sandinista measures that have antagonized private business and lowered production. That is one area marked for change by the coalition, which spans a broad spectrum of ideologies range from communist to conservative. Its platform envisions less state control of the domestic and export markets, more foreign investment and a freeing of the economy. It also mentions in several places its intent to separate the armed forces from politics and reduce the size of the 200,000-strong army _ the largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The coalition said it will announce its candidates for president and vice president next week. Coalition members still must decide the procedure for choosing the candidates. Likeliest choices for their presidential candidate are <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, whose family owns the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>; businessman <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> <PERSON> Geyer </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>.

 Three off-duty sheriff's deputies were found shot to death in a murder-suicide blamed on an apparent love triangle, a sheriff's spokesman said Saturday.

The bodies of the Vests were found in the front room, near a 9mm pistol believed used in the killings, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>'s body was in the kitchen.

 More than 180 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested Saturday during protests in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, while 400 people marched six miles in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to demand that politicians support abortion rights.

Police in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, arrested 44 anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked the doors to a Planned Parenthood clinic for nearly four hours Saturday. On the opposite side of the issue, 400 pro-choice demonstrators turned out for a six-mile walk-a-thon along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> boardwalk. The event was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NOW-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> to raise money for the state chapter's <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> National NOW President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said the march in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> helped identify candidates for the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> who support the right to an abortion and would get the word to voters. `` Voters in this country do believe that it's up to a woman to decide what happens to her body,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. Referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision this summer giving states the right to regulate abortion, Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women are very mad about what happened, and they're not going to take it any more. And there are a lot of men who support that.'' About 200 anti-abortion advocates protested outside the Cherry Hill Women's Center early Saturday morning. Those arrested were charged with defiant trespassing for blocking the center's entrances, said Police Sgt <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. At the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, clinic, police charged the `` Operation Rescue'' members, most from the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, with trespassing and released them on their own recognizance, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Highbarger </PERSON>. Several abortion-rights activists held a counter-demonstration. `` They yelled back and forth, but that was it,'' <PERSON> Highbarger </PERSON> said. Women waiting for abortions or to pick up birth control goods remained in a parking lot across the street until the clinic opened, said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> McCanse, the clinic's community affairs director. Some were upset, but none left, she said. The clinic performs 10 to 12 abortions on a typical Saturday, <PERSON> McCanse </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, three people who attempted to block the entrance to the Comprehensive Health for Women clinic also were arrested on trespassing charges Saturday.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> asked his entire Cabinet to resign and Saturday announced a new body of advisers, naming a new foreign minister but keeping his economic team.

<TEXT>
 A new expedition spurred by the theory of two retired military fliers is planned next month to try to solve the mystery of <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s disappearance. The pioneering aviatrix and her navigator, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, vanished 52 years ago in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> on a 2,556-mile leg of their attempted flight around the world. The <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that two men from this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> city, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Willi </PERSON>, 62, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, 69, who had been an Air force navigator, have persuaded The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> TIGHAR </ORGANIZATION>, that they had the navigation clues to solve the mystery. The organization plans to send a 20-member expedition that will include <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Sept. 4, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, executive director and search team leader for the group based in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, del. There have been numerous theories to explain Ms. <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s disappearance, including speculation that she was captured by the Japanese and executed as a spy <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> believe she may have come down on <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, then known as <LOCATION> Gardner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 1,000 miles south of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. They base their theory on a study of her flight plan and other information. They contend winds may have blown the plane southeast of its destination, <PERSON> Howland </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilsand </PERSON>, toward <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION>. With only two hours of fuel left, Ms. <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> decided to fly south toward <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> because they knew there were no other islands to the north of their flight path within range of their remaining fuel, <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> contend. `` We're just amazed that nobody ever figured this out before,'' <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. `` The whole thing was a navigation problem. I guess it took two navigators to hopefully solve it.'' Although it had been widely thought the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> searched the island, <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said they found out that float planes from the battleship USS Colorado flew over but no search party ever landed there. They say have other clues, including the reported 1938 discovery on the island of a female skeleton wearing American shoes. Ms. <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> disappeared on July 2, 1937. In the four days after they vanished, radio operators at different locations picked up 24 transmissions made in a female voice and on Ms. <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s frequency. When plotted, the transmissions cross at <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> say. `` We have always stayed away from the <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> thing,'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. `` We're a non-profit aviation archaeological foundation, and there are so many theories about <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> that are n't credible.'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said, however, that he changed his mind after spending a day with <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> as they unraveled clues based mainly on celestial navigation techniques that he described as a lost art. Those techniques, he said, are what Ms. <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> relied upon in the days before electronic navigation systems. The expedition is expected to last through the first week of October and cost up to $ 250,000.

After a brief session Saturday afternoon at a downtown hotel, negotiators returned a few hours later and signed the agreement _ a three-year contract that covers about 10,100 workers. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which called for a strike against <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> just after midnight on Aug. 13, urged its <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> locals to stay off the job and on the picket lines until five other labor disputes in the Ameritech system are resolved. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> includes <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> and the regional <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states went on strike earlier this month against four regional telephone companies. Union leaders have negotiated tentative settlements with striking employees at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, which serves <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, which covers <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had agreed to resume bargaining with its striking workers for the first formal talks since that walkout started almost three weeks ago. Terms of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> settlement were not revealed. A main issue in the impasse was whether a pay increase should be given in a lump sum, as the company wished, or put into base-pay schedules, as the union sought. `` We feel that we have a very fair and innovative agreement,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant vice president for labor relations and the company's chief contract negotiator. `` We feel we have done some good work in terms of wages and benefits, family care and other issues. We feel we have positioned both the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> telephone company and the employees for the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said. Communications Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> staff represtative <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrig </PERSON> said the union will not reveal specifics until the agreement is ratified, which he estimated would take up to a week. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> provides service to about 2.5 million homes and businesses in about two-thirds of the state. Some 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> administrators and supervisors have attempted to maintain the company's business and customer services during the strike.

<HEAD>Government Closes Opposition Party Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government closed down three opposition party newspapers Saturday and said it will arrest their editors and confiscate equipment used to publish them. A statement from the Government and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the newspapers were published `` to slander and damage leaders of the national government and its institutions, following the lines of American imperialism in its aggression against the fatherland.'' The three newspapers are published by the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. All three are among opposition parties calling for the ouster of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> wields the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. No arrests were reported Saturday. Opposition leaders did not immediately comment on the order. The communique said the publications violated news media laws but did not detail alleged offenses. It ordered `` the arrest of any person who irresponsibly edits and sells'' the newspapers. `` Far from orienting national public opinion, they do no more than plant hatred and bitterness in the Panamanian family,'' it said. Tension between the government and opposition has been increasing in recent days. On Friday, the civilian government's term of office expires. The opposition refused a government offer to share power in a civilian-military junta. Foreign observers said the opposition won May 7 elections by a landslide, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled the balloting. The opposition demands the May 7 elections be recognized and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave. The government has refused. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions in an effort to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to turn over power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. He denies the charges.

 Soviet warships are tentatively scheduled to visit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sometime next summer in the first such naval port visit to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday quoted unnamed <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources as saying the visit will be part of a military exchange program to include a port visit by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. No exact date has been set for either visit, the sources said. `` We have agreed in principle to a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who works with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> that proposed the visits. `` We offered the Soviets visits to either <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>.

 The sixth named tropical storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season formed off the African coast Saturday as its predecessor, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>, withered in cooler northern waters, forecasters said. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, was expected to intensify as it moved westward, according to forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. At 10:30 p.m. EDT Saturday, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>'s center was near 17.7 north latitude and 24.1 west longitude, or about 90 miles northwest of <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, moving toward the west at about 8 mph. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>, which was downgraded from a hurricane on Saturday, was centered near 53.0 north latitude and 30.5 west longitude, or about 800 miles west of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, at 10:30 p.m. EDT and moving toward the northeast near 35 mph. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s strongest winds were clocked at 55 mph and a continued decrease in strength was forecast. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> posed no threat to land and was expected to lose its tropical characteristics as it moved over colder waters, the center said. `` It looks like it's going downhill,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Beven </PERSON>.

His earnings would have allowed him to rent a boat for a fishing venture that would have generated $ 100,000, he said. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said he went to court because <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> made him a take-it-or-leave-it offer of only $ 500.

 A federal jury on Saturday night declared independence militant <PERSON> Filiberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> innocent of all charges filed against him for shooting at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents during his 1985 arrest. `` This has been a historic verdict. A message of powerful content to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> told hundreds of well-wishers outside the federal building. `` I was tried by their court ... but by Puerto Ricans, and they lost!'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> said she could not free <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> since he still is wanted in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for his alleged part in a $ 7 million Wells Fargo robbery there in 1983. Defense attorney <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> probably will be transferred to <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and eventually be flown to <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. The 12-member jury issued the verdict after more than four hours' deliberation <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, self-proclaimed leader of the pro-independence <PERSON> Macheteros </PERSON> underground group, had faced charges for shooting at federal agents during his 1985 arrest at his home in <LOCATION> Luquillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> was slightly injured when struck by a bullet fragment in the eye. The five-week trial, in which <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> defended himself, ended Thursday. The jury dropped all eight charges, including assault, illegal arms possession and preventing federal agents from carrying out an arrest. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> claimed he acted in self-defense when he opened fire with his Uzi submachine gun, alleging the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who raided his home shooting their weapons intended to kill him. `` I could reach no other conclusion,'' <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> told the jury. `` They tried to assassinate me.'' He said he had been under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance for weeks and could have been arrested at any time, making the raid unnecessary. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> acknowledged he burned documents moments before the federal agents burst into his apartment, but said it was to protect the identity of other Puerto Rican independence militants. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romo </PERSON> told the jury that those activists were not `` innocent believers in the noble ideal of independence.'' He said <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> burned the documents to protect Puerto Ricans involved in illegal activities. During the trial, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> witnesses claimed they warned <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> to surrender before deciding to raid the apartment. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrested <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> and several other Macheteros members in an islandwide sweep on Aug. 30, 1985. Sixteen Puerto Ricans allegedly took part in the <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> robbery, including seven who were sentenced earlier this year. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claims the main suspect in the robbery, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> security guard <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON>, escaped to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with part of the loot. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> is expected to stand trial on the robbery charges at a later date. The trial came in the midst of heated debate of the island's relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which took control of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> after the 1898 Spanish-American war Draft legislation for a 1991 plebiscite on the island's future recently has been prepared. The options are statehood, independence or continued commonwealth status with more autonomy for its 3.2 million people. In a 1967 plebiscite, the Spanish-speaking <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island chose commonwealth status.

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman asked the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Friday to investigate a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ruling he says would allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to import South African steel for construction of a bridge across the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, a Democrat, said the decision by Customs' Commercial Rulings Division appears to go against the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which prohibits the importation of South African steel and iron into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, the ruling would allow two contractors hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houton </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Traylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, to import nearly 3.1 million pounds of steel from a South African company for the bridge project. Customs spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the agency was not prepared to comment late Friday on <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s inquiries. She said she could not confirm the substance of the ruling and officials at the division were not available for comment late Friday. The $ 91 million bridge would be the costliest state funded road work in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. According to <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, the ruling was issued July 14. `` Considering the fact that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and many other public officials both statewide and nationally have have gone on record opposing the inhumane system of apartheid and the purchase of materials derived from the exploitive use of cheap leabor, I can not even begin to comprehend this decision,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> has also asked <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, for an explanation. `` I am at a loss to understand why the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would apparently not only pass over the American steel industry and its workers, but also indirectly support <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid government,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to determine whether the Commercial Rulings Division has the jurisdiction to make such a ruling, and on what basis it made its decision. He also wants to known when the contract was signed, the name of the South African company, and whether the ruling violates the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 or any other laws on trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 is aimed at curtailing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of that country's system of racial separation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it found no examples of self-dealing by officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> during last month's forced liquidation of soybean futures contracts. But the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said a preliminary report by the commission raised possible conflict-of-interest questions about several of the officials who voted to require traders to reduce their holdings of contracts calling for future delivery of soybeans to them _ `` long'' positions. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> must question those <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> directors participating in the July soybean decision whose affiliated firms held net short positions in the July soybean contract in house or customer accounts,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., in a statement issued by his office `` Credibility is paramount for exchanges in carrying out their self-regulatory functions. The public will not tolerate self-dealing or conflict of interest by exchange directors or insiders,'' the <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> statement said. Holders of `` short'' positions, promises to deliver beans they do not own, would benefit from an order like the one issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on July 11. One who holds a short position can can buy and deliver beans, or he can buy an offsetting `` long'' position. Generally such a trader is betting on a fall in price and the ability to buy an offsetting contract at a price lower than he paid for his original contract, thus making a profit. If the `` longs'' are forced to sell, the price of the contract declines and the `` shorts'' can fulfill their obligations cheaper than they would otherwise. The order forcing `` longs'' to sell touched off wild swings in soybean prices and sparked sharp criticism by farm groups and traders who saw the value of their holdings drop. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has said it acted after consulting the commission because Italian grain merchant <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.A. </ORGANIZATION>, failed to reduce its large holdings in the July soybean market voluntarily. Officials of the exchange have said they were worried that there were not enough beans to fulfill all delivery commitments in the final days of the contract. The order required traders to reduce their long positions to 1 million bushels and was widely perceived as a move to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> from cornering the market _ that is, forcing other traders into a position of having to deliver beans to <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> where <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> was the only source of beans. Such a situation, if <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> could maintain it, would all but enable <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> to name its own price to let the other traders off the hook. Stock and commodity exchanges have rules aimed at banning `` corners.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has denied any wrongdoing or intention to corner the market and has bitterly critized the board's action. `` We continue to believe that is was totally unnecessary for the board to take its emergency action,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, an executive with <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> supports Sen. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s call for further investigartion by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> into the matter.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the exchange, said that even though directors may have represented firms whose customers held short July soybean positions `` they're not involved in the decision-making of their customers.'' The commission said it found no director who appeared to trade for the purpose of profiting personally, or through an affiliated firm, from prior knowledge of the July 11 order. One director excused himself before deliberations began because he held a spread position _ both long and short _ in July soybeans.

 <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> hopes his high-wire walk to the Eiffel Tower on Saturday will lift the hearts of the thousands watching, inspire them to try the impossible and demonstrate real freedom as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> celebrates justice and liberty. <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, known for his illicit and joyous walks between the towers of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' Notre Dame Cathedral and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s World Trade Center, said Friday he is ready for the walk that will take him 2,300 feet from the Palais de Chaillot to the Eiffel Tower's second level. `` I'm impatient to begin, to do something I've dreamt of doing my whole life,'' said <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, who was born 40 years ago in a suburb west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and now lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Rushing between the barber and a technical check of the rigging, the aerialist took a moment to reflect on the spectacle that is a highlight of French celebrations commemorating the bicentennial of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. `` People hear the word funambulist and they think of the circus, but that's not at all what I do,'' he said, gazing at the wire strung fine as a spider's web. `` I want people to be enlightened by a vision, I want to uplift their minds and hearts.'' <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, who shares with dancers a passion for poetic gestures and movements that transfigure, is asked with deadly monotony about the danger involved in his work. The question bores him. `` I take no risks. I've been preparing for this for 10 years and the technical aspects for six months,'' said <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, who did all his own rigging and studied blueprints, photos and charts. His walk was authorized by <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> who will be waiting on the tower's second level, 330 feet above the ground. <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> will carry a rolled copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man on his 40-pound balancing bar to lay in <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s hands. The document, distilling ideals of liberty and social justice that emerged in 1789 from the French Revolution, does n't interest Petit. He wants to present his own vision. `` When you see someone who does something seemingly impossible, it must be that anything is possible. I want to tell people, ` Your dreams can come true Not by luck but by shovel and ax.'

<HEAD>Taiwan, U.S. Agree To Fishing Pact In North Pacific</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have signed an agreement that will enable federal authorities to track Taiwanese fishing vessels by satellite in an effort to reduce illegal salmon fishing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The agreement, signed Thursday, calls for radio transponders to be installed in Taiwanese boats, allowing satellite surveillance of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fishing fleet. It also permits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to board those ships. In addition, the pact provides for observers to monitor the driftnet fishermen's impact on dolphin, porpoise, seal and other marine mammal populations. `` Tough negotiating pays off,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. `` I believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstone for an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a most vital resource.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> fishermen of using driftnets to deplete the North Pacific of its rich marine resources, especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Conservationists have criticized the driftnets, some of which are 40 miles long, for their `` incidental'' catches of thousands of sea birds, seals and other animals. Some Northwest fishermen said they liked what they heard Friday about the pact. `` It's another step forward,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But at least one environmental group warned the agreement does n't go far enough and that no such pact has been signed with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as a congressionally mandated deadline approaches `` You just ca n't trust these driftnetters,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ecology coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> represents 85 percent of the processors in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, estimated 7 million salmon were taken illegally during 1987. The agreement was signed for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laux </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Mou-shih </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomatic letters to finalize the agreement were signed Friday. The institute serves as the unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government severed diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1978. `` The key here is this monitoring equipment will go a long way to determining where those fish are caught and give us more confidence in managing the resource,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trawlers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. By signing the pact, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> beat a Monday deadline set by a 1987 law that threatened sanctions if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> did not agree to monitor their <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fishing fleets and enforce bans on taking high-seas salmon. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> signed an agreement in June that called for the experimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers _ nine American, five Canadian and 33 Japanese _ to monitor driftnet damage to marine mammal populations. Similar details were not available Friday for the pact with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that talks with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> had been suspended until Aug. 29. Similar agreements to those accepted by the Japanese and Taiwanese have been proposed. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-hsien </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> that his government agreed to the pact for the sake of 600,000 fishermen on the island who depend on exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, mostly of tuna and shrimp.

<HEAD>Treasury Bond Investors Disappointed As Interest Rates Stay Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some bond market investors had been pinning hopes on lower interest rates, but recent indications that the economy is maintaining strength have dashed speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will ease rates soon. With that prospect now unlikely, bond prices have fallen in recent weeks. The price drop has brought a return of an inverted yield curve, or the situation where short-term bonds yield more than longer-term ones. An inverted yield curve defies the logic that long-term investors should be compensated more than short-term ones because of the higher risk in holding debt for a longer period of time. A further weakening of bond prices has been caused by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, which has flooded the government bond market with new debt issues this month. Signs that a recession was not imminent prompted a bond selloff earlier this month, putting even more downward pressure on prices. Bonds are considered a good investment when the economy is slumping because their rate of return is constant. But to confuse matters, bond prices rallied briefly this past week. When bond prices rise, yields fall. Market watchers attributed the price rise to an auction of five-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues Wednesday that drew greater-than-expected demand. However, trading was thin Wednesday, leading some to speculate that the rally reflected buying interest among a small group of investors. Market-watchers looking to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for lower interest rates may be disappointed. The <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION>, which sets interest-rate policy, held its eight-times-a-year meeting last week, but, as is its practice, gave no hint of any decision on its strategy. Most experts expect the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to stay on its current course of moderating economic growth by holding interest rates steady. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been pressing for lower rates to stimulate economic growth, but the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> appears more concerned with forestalling any resurgence in inflation. `` A few weeks ago everyone assumed that the economy was slowing precipitously,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Veronda </PERSON>, senior vice president for fixed-income securities at the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Unfortunately for that thesis it now appears that the economy was either, one, never as bad as it appeared to be or two, there's been some slight reacceleration,'' he said The current bond slump curtailed a rally that sent <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> prices to two-year highs. The yield on the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond fell from about 9.30 percent in late March to 7.84 percent on Aug. 1. Since then, it has risen somewhat, and was trading in the range of 8 percent to 8.25 percent last week. Some market experts say that current economic conditions mean neither gloom nor doom for bond investors. `` While recession may not be imminent, a rebound in economic activity that could revitalize inflation appears remote,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said in a commentary last week `` Most of the market's recent setback reflects how too many investors had expected too quick an easing of monetary policy.'' Some market-watchers advise bond investors to put their money in the middle range of debt maturities, such as five-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes, striking a balance between the attraction of high yields on short-term instruments and the possibility of capital gains on long-term bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has advised customers to reduce their long-term bond holdings as a percentage of their total investments due to the belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will not ease interest rates soon. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> and other investment houses believe that long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasuries </ORGANIZATION> will hold in the range of 8 percent to 8.50 percent in coming months. But, says <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, it now seems more likely that these bonds would yield more than this range rather than less in the near term. `` We continue to see the potential for still lower yields over the intermediate to longer term on the assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> continues a policy of, on balance, restraint as long as the economy is operating near full resource utilization,'' the investment house said in a commentary.

<HEAD>Sugar Prices Swing Between Sweet and Sour</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices fluctuated widely on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders bought into the market on news of a large purchase by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and bailed out on reports the European sugar beet crop may exceed last year's. Adding to sugar price instabilty is what analysts say is the inability of the October futures contract to sustain advances at a price higher than 14 cents a pound. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said traders view the sugar market as bullish, but are afraid to buy contracts. He said there wo n't be a significant change in trader attitudes until Third World countries are willing to pay high prices created by the delicate balance of supply and demand. World sugar stocks are low due to several years of poor sugar-cane crops and steadily rising consumption. <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON> said a factor keeping Third World countries out of the sugar market is that sugar is often bought and sold for dollars, making it expensive in terms of those country's currencies. A Third World leader, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, entered the market for 200,000 tons of refined sugar. But it had been expected that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would purchase as much as 500,000 tons of raw and refined sugar, so the smaller figure was a disappointment. Sugar prices fell sharply on projections by F.O. Licht, the West German sugar statistical firm, that European sugar production will increase from the 30.1 million tons produced last year to 32.3 million tons. Licht also said weather in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had been excellent, resulting in an improved crop of sugar in that country, reducing its import needs.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> might measure up to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> as a showman, but the multimillionaire motorcyclist does n't hold a candle to the vaudevillian hoofer when it comes to outdancing the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Forbes dropped some vague hints that he might seek a tax deduction for his belly-dancing `` party of the century'' last weekend in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, where such swells as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> ate pigeon under tents. After a small public outcry, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> called a news conference to say he would not be taking a deduction for his 70th birthday party and in fact had never considered doing so. Clearly business entertainment is not what it was 59 years ago, when the late <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> scored a victory over the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> so sweeping that tax lawyers still talk about `` the <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> rule.'' <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON>, the original <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doodle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boy </ORGANIZATION>, claimed $ 55,000 in deductions for entertaining his actors, employees, drama critics and lawyer in the early 1920s. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> disallowed the deductions because he had n't kept records. In 1930, a federal appeals court ruled that since <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> obviously had some legitimate expenses, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> appeals board should find a way to grant him some deductions in spite of the lack of records. The <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> rule hamstrung the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> over the following decades, and `` people who knew how to milk the system probably got more than they should have,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, senior tax research and training specialist for <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. In the 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has tightened the tax laws on business entertainment considerably, not only toughening record-keeping standards to eliminate the <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> rule but cutting the deduction rate to 80 percent and gradually limiting or disallowing deductions that once were routine: golf club dues, nights out at cheesy discos, sky boxes at the Superdome. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> argued this past week that he could have qualified for some deductions if he had wanted to, since many of his guests were advertisers in his magazine, but several tax experts said the magazine publisher was living in the past. `` I do n't know where <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> was coming from,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Borino </PERSON>, national tax director for the accounting firm of <PERSON> BDO </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>. `` Even under the old law, before tax reform, I would have serious questions as to whether the cost of any part of that birthday was deductible.'' `` It used to be kind of fair game, you go to a sporting event or you go out to a nightclub-type restaurant and have a great time, and just because you happen to do business with the people, you deduct it. That just does n't fly anymore,'' said H & amp; R Block's Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> is not the only victim of changing times: A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> rabbi, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, was turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 when he tried to deduct the $ 4,000 cost of his son's bar mitzvah reception for 725 people. Under Section 274 of the tax code, the taxpayer must establish that `` the item was directly related to or ... associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.'' For <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, discussing hot-air balloons with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> thus would not qualify. Moreover, there is no deduction for `` amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances,'' which would seem to disqualify a party featuring 600 belly dancers and a thundering horde of 200 Berber marksmen on horseback. `` It's a very good example of what used to be, and would be a real hard sell now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said.

 As they study the forces behind the advance that carried the stock market to record highs in the past week, some analysts look far beyond the latest swing in interest rates or the economic outlook for 1990. The impressive gains in stock prices this year, they say, have merely extended a historic bull market that can be traced back to 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average stood as low as 776.92, or even 1974, when it bottomed at 577.60. As the charts of this long climb keep stretching out, they make the crash of 1987 look less and less like the cataclysmic event it seemed at the time, for all the pain it inflicted. The first would-be historians of the great bull market see several large-scale themes running through it: _ A return to free-market economic policies in the world's industrialized countries after the increased reliance on government control and regulation that had taken place in the years since World War _ A sense of capitalism on the offensive, and communism on the defensive, around the world, with economic power gaining importance over military might _ A largely successful campaign to subdue inflation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after a scary surge in prices in the 1970s that had eroded confidence in financial rather than tangible assets _ The `` restructuring'' of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry, under pressure from foreign competition, to make it fit once again to hold its own in global markets Broad generalizations of this kind make many investors squirm. Any time people start believing grandiose claims about the supposed significance of what the market is doing, veterans of the game start to suspect that stocks are ripe for a fall. Still, ideas like this suggest that the stock market has been doing a lot more in the 1980s than just bouncing around wildly at the whims of computer-program traders or the latest monthly economic statistic. Furthermore, they represent the kind of long-term thinking that separates true `` investors'' from traders bucking the house odds to try to profit from a hot tip or takeover rumor. At the close on Friday, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>'s average of 30 industrials stood at 2,732.36, up 44.39 from the week before. Among the broader indexes that had preceded the Dow to new highs several weeks earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 2.15 to 194.79; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 4.78 to 466.75, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 2.00 at 381.18. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 165.96 million shares a day, up from 148.84 million the week before. The back-to-nature economics movement underlying the bull market has n't always been a pretty or popular phenomenon. It has been accompanied by financial scandals in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; upheavals in the once-stable working environments of countless employers, and a long-running debate over whether the energy born of rampant self-interest will take any society where it wants to go. Many observers worry that it has spawned excesses _ most notably in the use of borrowed money at every level of the economy _ that could sooner or later turn the market's heyday into a wistful memory. But for now at least, it has validated the faith of true believers in the long-term merits of stock ownership, 1987 crash or not. As <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> put the case in the investment advisory letter <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION>, `` Those who forswear the stock market forever because of -LRB- the crash -RRB- overlook the real lesson of history: A long-term stock investment program is the most reliable, and easiest, way to accumulate wealth that our society has to offer.''

 Though some first-time investors who were scared away by the stock market crash two years ago never returned, those who remained got their reward, market watchers said. The record high of 2,734.64 in the Dow Jones industrials average Thursday once again pointed out the value of a long-term investment strategy, these observers said. On Friday, the average slipped back 2.28 points to 2,732.36. Anyone who held stocks for the past two years has about broken even, while people who panicked and sold at the bottom took big losses. `` A person has to live through a market break to fully appreciate what can happen in the next market peak,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Janke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group of individual investors and investment-club members. Media accounts of small investors abandoning the stock market after the crash were overblown, says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloonan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>. The shrinkage in his members' stock portfolios was mainly from a drop in the market price of shares, not stock sales, he said. Industry figures show that individual investors did leave the market after the crash, but that many have since returned. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an average of 37 million shares a day were traded by retail, as opposed to institutional, customers on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987. That November, after the crash, the average number of daily retail trades dropped to 31 million. The average for all of 1988 was 29 million retail trades a day. But the figure jumped to 39 million a day from January to June of this year, the latest figures available. `` The retail investor definitely is back,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>, director of industry studies for the industry group. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Scidmore </PERSON>, a small investor in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said he believes the Dow high could scare some investors away from the market rather than lure new ones. `` The little investors, you can to go any -LRB- investment -RRB- club now and they're chewing their fingers and saying the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s up now and it's due for a fall,'' said <PERSON> Scidmore </PERSON>, who is retired and belongs to two investment clubs. <PERSON> Scidmore </PERSON> is not frightened away himself. `` If you're in it for the long run, so what?'' he said. `` It goes up and it goes down.'' Individual investors feel unable to compete with market professionals and institutions, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, a portfolio manager with <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an independent financial consultant in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The individual investor feels that he's sort of outside looking in, that the experts know what's going on, they know where to look for takeover candidates,'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. `` The individual feels that he does n't get a fair shake.'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> believes the Dow high will do little to lure more small investors back to the market. He said the reaction of many is, `` Well, I missed it and I should have been in on it but it's too late now.'' `` I think if we had a recession and we got into it for couple of quarters, and of course the stock market would probably be lower, then I think you'd see the individual investor coming back,'' he said. On the flip side of that coin, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said that if the Dow continues its upward climb and sets more records, the trauma of the crash could fade into the back of many investors' minds. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunnan </PERSON>, an author of investment books, agreed that many individual investors have returned to the market. But, she said, ``'87 was n't that long ago, so you're not going to see all of them jump back in.'' She said small investors should have learned at least one lesson from the crash. `` I think they should watch the market every single day and not let it ride, and if they see a dip and they've already made their profit to not be shy or greedy and take that profit,'' she said.

 The Japanese did it in six months. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> did it in 19 months, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> beat us by 20 days. While the new record set by the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was celebrated as a symbolic comeback from the crash of 1987, other stock markets around the world have made faster recoveries than Wall Street. `` It was n't that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> did poorly,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` It's that the other markets had special circumstances.'' A market measure compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> and based on overall market performance shows that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market reached a new high on July 26, lagging <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. On the continent, 1992 became a phenomenon that investors could `` sink their teeth into,'' and Europeans worked hard to sell investors on the concept of a single market of 320 million consumers, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It refocused attention on ... the tremendous opportunities that will be there in the private sector'' as trade barriers melt away and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> becomes an unencumbered free market, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said In advance of 1992, the mergers and acquisition fever that has heated up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for so long `` spread its virus to the continent,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. Last year, Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBenedetti </PERSON> almost single-handedly hoisted the Belgian market out of the doldrums with his hostile _ and ultimately unsuccessful _ bid for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, a huge Belgian conglomerate. In addition to outright mergers, European companies are fast forming cross-border alliances with like-minded firms. All that is bringing in `` new technology, new competitors and more strength and vitality to markets that had been a little more parochial,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index hit a new high on Aug. 4 and has since surpassed that mark. The broader 100-share index is just 46 points shy of its all-time high. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, long the envy of other markets, posted a new high in April 1988, less than six months after Black Monday. But experts note the Japanese market did not fall as hard in the crash and therefore had less ground to regain than other markets. Additionally, extremely low yields in the Japanese bond market gave stocks a boost. `` There are not a lot of competing domestic instruments, so the stock market emerges as king,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. This year, however, its performance has been ho-hum. A scandal in the top ranks of government has taken its toll, as has the weakening of the yen against the dollar. Japanese investors flush with cash are looking farther afield for places to stash their money. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which also performed well following the crash riding the wave of enthusiasm over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s plans for economic expansion, was `` slam-dunked'' following the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> massacre, said <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>. The key Hang Seng index, which hit a 1989 high of 3,309.6 in mid-May, plunged to 2,093.6 on June 5. It has yet to near its pre-crash high. Surprisingly, some of the best post-crash opportunities can be found in emerging markets like <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and others, which allow foreigners to invest directly in securities. So far this year, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> has pegged their collective growth rate at about 33 percent. `` Over the long term, those markets will outperform others because they represent more rapidly expanding economies,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON> said. They are clearly riskier but offer an option to investors bent on diversification. Thanks to the recent strength of the dollar, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets remain attractive, compared to their foreign counterparts. `` There's clearly a pretty consistent flow into U.S.-dollar assets, including stocks, largely because confidence in our currency has been restored,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clough </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` A strong currency will just continually pull in foreign investments.'' Other economic factors add to the allure of American stocks and bonds. `` There's a good feeling in terms of interest rates coming down, corporate earnings going up, and that we've been able to avoid a hard landing,'' said <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said he was considering a sale of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> because the `` noise'' at strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was hurting the sister carrier's In an interview Friday with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the sale of part or all of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was under discussion partly because of the negative impact from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding `` We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` We have an obligation to look for alternatives ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has been impacted by the noise level from all of our friends over in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' He made the surprise announcement about <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday in response to a question at a company meeting. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9, five days after pilots, Machinists and flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers. The spillover from the Eastern situation has eroded bookings on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the two carriers. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> showed a net profit of $ 32.1 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $ 150.9 million a year earlier. Continental could benefit from `` distance'' from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. He cited the success of the Trump Shuttle, which enjoyed a sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought it from Eastern in early June for $ 365 million. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> stressed, however, a full or partial sale of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision has n't yet been made. `` We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible sale, he said. Despite the strife at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation as a fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> stock has soared from around $ 9 or $ 10 a share at the beginning of the year to over $ 20 currently. It rose 87 -LCB- cents Friday to close at $ 20.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, after jumping as high as $ 22.25. Possible buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> or part of it could include Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed a desire to merge with another airline. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, foreign airlines are allowed to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers. There also has been speculation that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, may be interested in a combination with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger with another airline, according to a source close to the company who asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an investor group, possibly including <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> or another foreign carrier. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Levites </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declined comment on the matter Friday. An <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> associate did n't immediately return a call seeking comment. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would carry a sale price of about $ 2 billion if it were sold in its entirety, and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> may be trying to find out what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested. `` The worst may be over and it surprises me he -LRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> -RRB- would be considering a major sale,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> a hot property. A group led by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is being ardently pursued by investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and others.

 Like kids tussling over an Easter basket of goodies, two federal agencies and the financial exchanges they regulate are squaring off over a new money-making product for investors known as a `` stock basket.'' On one side are the stock exchanges and their overseer, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, created in the depths of the Depression to regulate stocks and bonds and protect the people who invest in them. On the other side is the newer <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and its charges, the boisterous markets that deal in commodities such as soybeans, pork bellies and silver. The product at issue is technically called an `` index participation,'' but it resembles a basket of stocks because it allows investors to buy or sell something with a value tied to broad stock market indexes, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> 500. That's why it's also called a stock basket. A week ago, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ruled the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> overstepped itself in authorizing three exchanges, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, to trade stock baskets. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> held that the new financial instruments are futures contracts and should be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> _ throwing doubt on the legitimacy of the baskets traded on the stock exchanges. `` It's like being married for five years and finding out the preacher was n't licensed,'' says <ORGANIZATION> AMEX </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON>, `` and if you want to get married again, you have to do it in a different state.'' While the new products have n't been a raging success since trading began May 12 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, some observers they represent the future of the securities industry. New product development became particularly important after the 1987 stock crash, which depressed the business of many investment firms and forced them to seek ways of luring investors back. The American and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchanges, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, thought one answer would be stock baskets. Unlike stocks, investors never actually buy the securities that make up a stock index and therefore have no ownership rights. But unlike commodity futures, there's no settlement or termination date. The basket can be held indefinitely. For example, an investor could buy a basket tied to the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index when it has a value of 300. A monetary value is assigned to each contract, usually sold in lots of 100. If the value was $ 30 -LRB- or one-tenth the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index -RRB-, the basket would be worth $ 3,000 and if the index went up 10 points, the investor would make a profit of $ 100 because the lot of 100 was now worth $ 3,100. But the stock baskets also represent a challenge to similar products offered by the two major futures exchanges in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>: the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Those two exchanges claimed the stock baskets ought to be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and the appeals court agreed, saying the law creating the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> clearly gave it authority in this case. `` Our feeling is the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is best equipped to regulate futures products because it has the expertise,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Board of Trade. To <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mass </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finance subcommittee, who has tried unsuccessfully to push market reform legislation, the ruling `` highlights the problems inherent in this turf battle between the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> spokesman. But <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Medero </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, said: `` I do n't think the people here feel it is a turf battle _ not on the commissioner or staff level The turf battle may be more between the securities exchanges and the commodities exchanges, rather than the agencies, which is fine. That's competition.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> did file court papers in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawsuit stating its view that stock baskets are futures contracts, and if the ruling is appealed Ms. <PERSON> Medero </PERSON> said `` we would reiterate our position.'' Spokesmen for both stock and futures exchanges stopped short of saying another agency might not treat them fairly but indicated they preferred to deal with the one they've known for years. Stock exchange officials noted that margins _ the amount of money or collateral that must be put up to buy securities _ are less stringent in the futures markets. Under CFTC rules, said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange, the stock basket `` wo n't be a product that appeals to the public investor _ the man in the street. It'll be more speculative, have higher risk and would not enjoy the protection of public investor rules that have been cultivated by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> for 50 years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has yet to announce whether it will appeal the ruling by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> federal court. `` I really ca n't tell you until we do it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s solicitor, although he confirmed that the agency was discussing alternatives with the exchanges.
