<HEAD>Report: West German Tapped Into U.S. Military Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For nearly two years, a West German citizen gained access to more than 30 computers belonging to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and military contractors, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Monday's editions that the West German searched for data related to nuclear weapons, intelligence satellites, the Strat = e Initiative, the space shuttle and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> The Times, quoting computer security experts, said he did not gain access to any classified information or break into a `` secure'' government computer where classified information is stored. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed Sunday that the matter was under investigation. A West German magazine, Quick, detailed the case last week and identified the intruder as <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, 24, a computer science student in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would not confirm his identity, the Times said. The electronic break-ins may have gone on for a year before being discovered in August 1986, the newspaper said. They were monitored for a year and traced, the Times said, and in June 1987, the West German and an American who may have been an accomplice apparently were questioned by authorities. The break-ins stopped about the same time. `` This kind of penetration could clearly have been used for espionage,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, a computer security expert familiar with the case, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think most of the attacks before this have been relatively benign on a global scale. This one is much more insidious.'' Computer managers at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which is involved in broad-based unclassified scientific research, discovered the intrusions, the Times said. The laboratory and its sister institution, the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, which is involved nuclear weapons research and SDI, are operated by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> for the federal government. The break-ins involved a variety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military computer systems in this country, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the Times said, including systems at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Optimus </ORGANIZATION> data base and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 A medical evacuation xwzaking an injured motorcyclist to a hospital crashed Sunday in a fog-shrouded mountain pass, killing the pilot and a nurse, authorities said. The patient, the only other person aboard, survived, perhaps because he was strapped down in the aircraft's midsection, said county fire Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON>. The helicopter hit a power line in <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Lost </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said. `` When the craft came down, it hit a rock wall and went over an embankment,'' <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said. The pilot and nurr = wzified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skala </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamitos </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Hesperia </LOCATION>, sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> They were dead when rescuers arrived. The injured motorcyclist, a 26-year-old man whose name was withheld until relatives could be contacted, was flown to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition, said a nursing supervisor who would n't give her name. `` There were heavy clouds, fog and generally very bad weather in the pass,'' <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said. The helicopter apparently was trying to turn around to avoid the fog when it crashed, said county sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stodelle </PERSON>. The motorcyclist had suffered head and neck injuries in a crash in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> near Interstate 15 north of <LOCATION> Victorville </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said he had been strapped in, authorities found him `` sitting in a patch of sand in a creek bed'' near the downed craft, <PERSON> Stodelle </PERSON> said. `` He was alive, awake and incoherent,'' <PERSON> Stodelle </PERSON> said. The helicopter was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION>, where a spokesman said no information was available.

<HEAD>Apology, Videotape Wins Child Rapist Probation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A firefighter who pleaded guilty to raping a young girl has agreed to make of videotape of his confession in order to warn parents that respectable people can be child abusers, officials said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> was given probation after he agreed to make the tape and to apologize for saying he had been falsely accused. `` <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> represents a typical child molester that is so difficult to convict,'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. `` He's nice looking, had a good job, had children of his own, well-thought of in the community. People want to believe that the only ones who molest children are the dirty-old men in raincoats.'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> pleaded guilty to first-degree rape. He was charged last year with first-degree rape and first-degree sexual assault in a case involving an 11-year-old girl. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON>, who had sentenced <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> to 15 years in prison, earlier this month granted him probation. The sexual abuse charge was dropped as part of the plea bargain. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> must make the apology tonight to his former co-workers at a fire house in suburban <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> for saying the victim's mother fabricated the story. The videotape must be made at his expense by July and will be used by <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a center for child abuse victims, to educate the public about child sex abuse. The victim's mother said her agreement to probation was based on concern about her child having to testify in a trial and her belief that the videotape would help other children. `` All children in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> would benefit,'' she said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> called the case a breakthrough. `` The ultimate outcome offers a significant way to help the community with regard to these cases,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We gave up some things. They gave up some things.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, who resigned as a firefighter, already has been punished. The probation agreement requires <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> to seek psychiatric help, which <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> began receiving last year.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Without a Vote Cast, Dukakis Adds 105 Delegates</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 On the one hand, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has won all of two elections in a row and on a good day he draws maybe half the crowd and a quarter of the enthusiasm of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. On the other hand, over the past 12 days <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won an invisible primary the size of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and quietly boosted his claim on the Democratic presidential nomination. In the hiatus between <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s primary almost two weeks ago and Tuesday's voting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up pledges from 105 national convention delegates, and he won another 22 in Saturday's <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> caucuses. `` He's being called ` <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION>' in the barrios around <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>,'' the governor's Western coordinator, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ybarra </PERSON>, enthused after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and shut out Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. All told, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor stretched his delegate margin from a measly 36 to a more substantial 134. Where did all these delegates come from? Half came from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> delivered his blessing and 52 previously uncommitted delegates. But the 53 other pledges may prove more significant, for they may signify the first rumblings of an establishment bandwagon. They came from among the so-called super delegates, Democratic party leaders and officeholders who are beholden to no one and free to vote their consciences _ or to sniff the political winds. The nomination of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems all but inevitable _ except when you consider that he faces a stiff test from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and his 872-delegate total remains far below the 2,082 needed to win nomination in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The popular wisdom is that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> has been a front-runner from the beginning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ... -LRB- but -RRB- I said 10 weeks ago that you should not take the polls too seriously and that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> could win,'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says of the Dukakis-Jackson battle. `` I do n't think anything has changed since then. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is the wild card. If he does well, it could hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there's any doubt that he -LRB- <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> -RRB- is stronger now than he was a couple of weeks ago,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Sunday. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is doing well because he draws crowds, they're enthusiastic and that may be the very best barometer of all.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, concerned that his ethnic support may be soft and his backers must be motivated to vote, had some influential surrogates campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday. He brought in one of the not-so-nuevo <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, for a bring-out-the-vote effort and after marching in a `` Salute to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' parade, he attended a Gaelic football game and a reception with Gov. <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was touring Hispanic, Italian and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> neighborhoods while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with community leaders in a session set up by one of his most prominent Jewish supporters. Yet for all the attention, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is not the only election being held Tuesday _ congressional Democrats will caucus Tuesday and Wednesday to choose their super delegates to the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention. Most members were `` nominated'' in closed-door party meetings last week and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did very well on both sides of the Capitol, even in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is home to two of his remaining rivals. Most <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delegates remain uncommitted, but nine are lined up with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> picked up just four pledges from his colleagues, as well as his own, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> _ who doggedly maintains a one-state strategy _ had two pledges, his own and that of fellow <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won no pledges from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but fared better in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where 142 member-delegates are still uncommitted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has pledges from 26, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 15, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 12 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 10 -LRB- most of them from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> -RRB-. These super delegate pledges provide timely assistance for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because while he's favored to win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has there ever been a more invisible front-runner? The crowds drawn to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor _ <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> _ drawn to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> practically drove <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> off the local newscasts, except when he was under attack by the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator. Delegate counters for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor do not expect anyone, no matter who wins, to pick up more than 150 of the 255 delegates at stake in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But that's a lot of delegates in the splintered <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> environment _ it would put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> almost halfway to a nominating majority.

<TEXT>
 Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> insists he's not one for `` tilting at windmills,'' but his refusal to lay down his lance formally is posing a few tactical problems for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. For one thing, it may be helping to keep President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the sidelines, even though <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign poses no real obstacle to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s march to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed to remain neutral in the contest so long as there was a battle among Republicans, even though his active support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a foregone conclusion. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s main competitor, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, dropped out, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hinted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted to start stumping for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But so far he has n't scheduled any appearances. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has 922 delegates and after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday may have as many as 970 _ within easy grasp of the 1,039 needed for the Republican nomination. By contrast, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has a scant 17 delegates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is still behaving as if he has some competition for the nomination. He campaigned last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and today begins an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> swing in anticipation of primaries in those states in the next two weeks. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s vow to `` energize people who support me'' on issues also raises the possibility of a platform battle at the GOP convention, one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists would like to avoid. For his part, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has made no effort to contact <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or to try to mend fences, according to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp. `` I think he's plowed under,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a recent conversation with reporters on Air Force II. Asked if some prominent Republican, perhaps <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, might serve as a mediator between the two camps, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We do n't need any mediation. We need our facts clear.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still has not spoken to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, even though the two were back-to-back speakers last Friday before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> still appears to be smarting at the drubbing he received from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, insisting to the newspaper executives on Friday that there were `` no differences in either education or income level'' of those supporting him and those supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The major difference, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> suggested, is that `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was regarded as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the Second, or whatever, so they were voting again for the man who they have voted for twice before _ Reagan-Bush. I do n't think anybody could have done much better.'' `` I'm not <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>. I do n't believe in tilting at windmills. It's obvious from the delegate count that has come out that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be the nominee ...'' But still, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> remains the only candidate of the original five Republicans challenging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the nomination to persist in the face of the vice president's steamrolling candidacy. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have all formally withdrawn, releasing their delegates in the process. Suggestions that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> feels he has been unfairly treated in the process `` are absurd,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said no efforts have been made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his advisers to try to persuade <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to bow out gracefully. `` It would not be proper,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. However, the aide said, `` His campaign for the most part is dormant. He's doing very little traveling. It's almost as if his campaign is nonexistent.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign has acknowledged he has spent nearly all the money allowed for the primary season under federal spending limits. He has laid off most of his staff and confined his campaigning to an occasional trip. As for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s non-participation, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> suggested that might change `` once we have the delegates to go over the top.'' According to an Associated Press delegate count, that will come no later than May 3 _ possibly even sooner -RCB-; klZkl -LRB- C

 Turnout at tonight's Democratic presidential caucuses in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> is expected to hit a record high due to an organizing drive by backers of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the state's party chief said. At the 41 caucuses, held by state representative district, 189 delegates will be chosen to the state convention May 23. There, the party will choose 15 of its 19 delegates to the Democratic national convention. Four of the delegate slots automatically go to the state chairman, vice chairwoman, the national committeeman and national committeewoman. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, state party chairman, said normal caucus turnout is about 2 percent of the state's 135,000 registered Democrats. This year, though, he predicts a 3 percent or 4 percent turnout _ which would be a record _ due to a big push by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s backers. `` The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> people are very organized and have been for three or four months. They've had a major presence on a local level,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. `` We have an inspiring and fervent and committed group of people who think this is going to be a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> state,'' said <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> co-coordinator for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Those attending the caucuses will split into groups based on their preference for president, including those uncommitted. Any candidate, including uncommitteds, who gets at least 15 percent of the vote will be awarded delegates to the state convention. Ms. <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign has been active in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> since September. She said she expects the predominantly black 2nd and 3rd representative districts in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> to go to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but she also predicted he om_Oo @ ghout the state. Organizers for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have been in the state for about a month. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state director, saiw ~ @ rces caused a late start, but was upbeat about her candidate's prospects `` We have a good organization in place. We're going district by district to get the message out to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Democrats. It's a message of a candidate that can beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November,'' she said. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has no organization in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The Republicans have been holding caucuses since April 5. On April 25, they will select delegates to the party's state convention May 14. The <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> GOP had campaigned for former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> while the state's Democrats threw their support behind Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Study: Hospitals Made $2 Billion on Unneeded Stays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators havr evidence suggesting the nation's hospitals are making billions of dollars extra by admitting patients who could be treated better and cheaper without hospitalization. A draft report prepared by the inspector general's office of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> concludes that hospitals probably were paid about $ 2 billion by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to treat patients who should not have been hospitalized in the first place. `` Although an estimated $ 939 million would have been spent providing care to these patients in other medical settings, reducing unnecessary admissions to hospitals is one of the most effective ways of saving Medicare dollars,'' says the report, a copy of which was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The analysis was based on 7,050 patient records at 214 randomly selected hospitals from October 1984 to March 1985. It concluded that 740 admissions, or 10.5 percent, were unnecessary. There is potential financial incentive to admit patients who do not need hospitalization under a plan established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 which sets a fixed payment for each of 475 diagnosis related groups _ or DRGs, as they are known in the industry. A hospital receives the same payment for each admission for a particular diagnosis regardless of the actual services provided or length of time a patient spends in the hospital. `` Hospitals retain a profit when patient care costs less than the DRG payment, but must absorb losses when costs are higher than the DRG,'' the report noted. Against that background, the study found that the average length of stay for the unnecessary admissions was 4.4 days, compared with 7.6 days for necessary admissions. `` Most of the unnecessary admissions needed medical attention, but not in an acute care setting,'' the report said. It placed nearly 78 percent in that category, but concluded that almost 12 percent of the patients did not require immediate treatment of any kind when they were admitted. Most of the other medically unnecessary admissions were classed as either `` social admissions,'' such as temporarily hospitalizing an elderly person because he or she did not have any other place to stay, or instances of frail people being hospitalized when they should have been admitted to a nursing home instead. Only 25 of the 214 hospitals studies had no unnecessary admissions, according to the report, but there was wide variation in the rates of unnec? admissions for the others. For example, at least half the admissions were judged unnecessary at two hospitals and at least a third at eight other institutions. Twenty percent or more of the sampled admissions at 34 hospitals were found unnecessary. No individual hospitals were named in the study. Neither were any variations among states or regions of the country detailed. The overall 10.5 percent unnecessary admissions rate for the cases sampled is far higher than the maximum 2.5 percent unnecessary admission rate reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> by any of the state peer review organizations the federal agency pays to police hospitals. One of the major recommendations in the report is that the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, determine why those peer review organizations identify a substantially lower rate of unnecessary admissions than the inspector general's survey found, and require them to adopt more effective screening techniques. The inspector general's report found the unnecessary admissions tended to be concentrated in five diagnostic groups: back problems, diabetes, bone cancer, digestive disorders and upper respiratory tract infections. The study methodology involved selecting hospitals at random to reflect the overall numbers of small, medium and large hospitals. Registered nurses were hired to screen records using objective screening techniques approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. If a case looked suspect, it was referred to a physician for review. `` Reviewers ignored marginal problems or cases involving honest differences in medical judgment about appropriate case management,'' the report said. Moreover, if documentation in the record was so poor reviewers could not make a determination, it was given the benefit of doubt and considered a necessary admission.

As he did, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' organization was concluding two weeks of telephone calls to a half-million likely Democratic voters in a targeted effort to remind them to turn out when the voting begins Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides were trying to spread their view of the race with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as tightening, although a late poll by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network-USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead by 12 points. `` I never talk about polls because I do n't pay any attention to them. I did once and will never do it again,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, a reference to the re-election defeat he suffered after his first term as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. On Saturday, standing in a blustery cold in front of chunks of ice floating on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered a reminder of his crushing loss in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses, a 2-1 defeat that had not been predicted. `` What is important is that they vote,'' he said. `` I've been ahead in the polls before, in my own state, and I was way ahead in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and we all know what happened there.'' His <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign director, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bograd </PERSON>, said volunteers had been working 500 to 600 phones a night calling voters in precincts where demographic indicators suggest <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should be strong. After meeting his rivals in their last debate of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign Sunday morning, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> walked 25 blocks up 5th Avenue where he drew warm cheers from thousands of people who lined the streets for the city's parade honoring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary. He followed, out of sight of Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who walked together. At Gaelic Park in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> threw a ball during halftime of an Irish football game _ a rough sport that has elements of soccer and rugby. He moved into a dance hall at the park as a band and female singer shifted smoothly from a <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> country-blues medley to the Irish tune, `` Take Me Home To Mayo,'' and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> waltzed for the cameras. Shifting to a Latin beat, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveled to another <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> neighborhood where a band played rhythmically with conga drums and other instruments and the 200 people danced and sang, `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Du-ka-key </PERSON>, pres-i-dent-e.'' With him was Puerto Rico Gov <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and each spoke in Spanish to the predominantly Hispanic audience inside the <LOCATION> Club </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cubano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americano </LOCATION>, where pink paint peeled from the walls and stairwell windows were broken out. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` talks our own language,'' the Puerto Rican governor told them, using Spanish.

Twelve <ORGANIZATION> Fairview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students received 10-day suspensions for the prank Friday during the performance of `` Shakespeare on Broadway'' and `` West Side Story'' by the Cleveland Opera On Tour. `` They may feel it was a prank, but we do not consider it humorous,'' said Assistant Principal <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulik </PERSON>. `` It disturbed a very fine program and was not in good taste.

<TEXT>
 All 1,900 guards in the Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s 11 prisons went on strike Saturday following the breakdown of talks with officials of Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s government. The government said it would use 1,000 police officers, about a tenth of the nation's police force, and about 300 soldiers to staff the prisons. The prisons hold about 2,000 inmates. It is the first national walkout by prison guards in the nation's history. The prison guards' union, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement the strike is a protest against the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to impose new shift arrangements without consulting the guards The union also says it wants money used to pay for guard overtime to be used to hire more prison staff. But the department said the cause of the dispute is the guards' demand for compensation for overtime payments lost last year when extra staff was hired The department said the extra staff was added partly to meet union complaints about staff shortages. The strike comes amid reports of unrest in some prisons. Four prisoners at the high-security <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION>, 47 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, were reported to have smashed up their cells to protest conditions. About 130 of the 200 prisoners at the <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION> prison are convicted guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.

 Government and rebel negotiators met Saturday in search of ways to achieve peace, but the two sides remained far apart on the key issue of a permanent truce. After day-long talks they agreed to resume negotiations Sunday. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a spokesman for the rebels, said the discussions had been frank, and Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> called the meeting `` a productive day where we advanced quite a bit.'' Neither side gave details of the talks. More than 1,000 people gathered in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to protest the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for the rebels known as Contras and demand that their leaders sign a cease-fire during the discussions. The demonstrators carried signs saying, `` Cease North American Support of the Contras.'' No incidents were reported. The delegations met briefly Friday night, then gathered again at the negotiating table at 9 a.m. -LRB- 11 a.m. EDT -RRB- Saturday behind closed doors and recessed at 7 p.m. The rebels are demanding the Sandinista government take the first steps toward returning <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to freely elected democratic rule before they sign an armisice. `` If we sign a permanent cease-fire without first taking steps to lead -LRB- the country back -RRB- to democracy, it would be tantamount to surrender on our part,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, the top Contra negotiator, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview shortly before the start of Saturday's session. Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the Sandinista defense minister and head of the government delegation, said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> believe an agreement on a permanent truce comes first. `` The victory we should seek is a permanent cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters. But both sides expressed optimism they could reach agreement. `` We came here with faith and goodwill and we hope to find the same goodwill on the other side to reach agreement that will benefit all Nicaraguans,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. He added, however: `` We have reservations to return to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on Monday afternoon. If the negotiations are on the right track, then we could prolong our stay.'' This is the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have allowed Contra leaders to come to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> since the revolt began in November 1981. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has said 26,500 people have been slain in the conflict. A 60-day cease-fire has been in effect since April 1 and continued to be holding on Saturday. Even though each side has accused the other of violating the cease-fire, incidents have been few and minor. The Contra umbrella organization known as Nicaraguan Resistance said in a brief statement Saturday that Sandinista helicopter gunships have been violating the cease-fire by trying to chart rebel troop movements. It also said <PERSON> Sandinista </PERSON> `` agents'' have been trying to contact rebel commanders to discuss peace. The statement issued in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where the Contras have their headquarters, added: `` Consequently we are instructing our combatants to reject any contact with these elements, the majority of whom belong to the State Security forces, or to capture them.'' Delegates signed the 60-day cease-fire on March 23 after three days of negotiations in the tiny border post of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Agreement on the technical aspects of the cease-fire was reached during talks that ended Friday at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, and the two sides agreed to further technical talks at this week's high-level meetings in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The sides have agreed on seven cease-fire zones where the rebels would gather during the temporary cease-fire until a permanent truce is negotiated. But the logistics of moving into those zones, whether the Contras would give up their weapons, and how they would be resupplied have kept the sides apart. Although details of Friday's talks were not released, a joint communique said the delegations had made `` substantial progress.'' The Soviet-supported <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have been in power since defeating the right-wing government of the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979.

 First results from rural counties gave <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a strong early lead over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential caucus Saturday. In <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 66 votes compared with 21 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Tennessee Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> got 18 votes while <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has suspended his candidacy, got four votes and political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> had one vote. Three voters expressed no preference. In <LOCATION> Greenlee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 144 votes compared with 27 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 13 for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and three each for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and no preference. `` We expected to win <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ybarra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' director for western states `` If we do, if the preliminary numbers hold up, it will be a continuation of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign winning in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.'' Backers of both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have insisted their candidate can capture the caucus because of the traditional low turnout. Traditionally, only about 25,000 to 30,000 of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 680,000 Democrats turn out for the primary-style vote which is the first step toward choosing 36 delegates to the July 18-21 national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Party Executive Director <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Saturday evening he did not yet have an accurate turnout projection. `` I think we can win <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign coordinator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said earlier Saturday. `` People committed to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tend to be more apt to go out and vote.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> state director <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> was pleased with his candidate's endorsements this week by <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Volgy </PERSON> and a number of other state and local government leaders. `` If the word gets out, it's significant,'' <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said. `` These are all very well-known and respected individuals.'' However, he acknowledged the vote Saturday could be close. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> agreed earlier in the day, saying `` It's anybody's ball game.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the only candidate who visited the state. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s local coordinator, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, said he is disappointed the national campaign allocated no money or candidate visits to the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> campaign. `` It's not the easiest way to put on a presidential race,'' <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON> said. `` He is the kind of moderate candidate that we feel would have appealed to the Democratic voters in rural <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' Thirty-six of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 41-member delegation are up for grabs Saturday. The other five are `` super delegates'' _ four top party officials and Gov. Rose Mofford, all of whom are uncommitted. Saturday's vote is conducted like a primary, except there are only 99 polling places statewide. Democrats will vote twice: first, for the presidential candidate of their choice, and second, for the delegates they want to represent that candidate. The top 500 potential delegates, in proportion to the candidates they represent, will go to regional caucuses May 28. At those caucuses, 23 national convention delegates will be chosen. Later, in June, another 13 delegates _ also in proportion to the candidate vote _ will be chosen by the state committee from among party and elected officials. <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has a `` distinct advantage'' in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> voting system, which is similar to the process in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won a few weeks ago. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the strong leader in a poll of Democratic voters conducted several weeks ago. It found 36 percent in his corner, compared with 17 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 4 percent for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. The poll did not screen for likely voters.

 Republican <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> claimed victory Saturday night in an election to fill the northwest <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> congressional seat vacated by Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, but his opponent refused to concede. With all 371 precincts reporting from the 4th Congressional District, unofficial returns gave <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> 63,481 votes, or 51 percent, to 61,900 votes, or 49 percent, for Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. The winner will serve the remaining months of <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s 1987-89 congressional term. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was inaugurated governor in March. `` To be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman and help ensure the future of this great nation ... has long been a dream of mine. I will be a good congressman,'' <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> told supporters. He also said he will run for a full two-year term in the fall. `` This race is razor-thin. I'm not ready to concede,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` I think the race is too close to call. I think we'll wait We'll know more about it when the voting machines are opened. ... I still think we can win this.'' The governor's office, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and private security guards will guard all of the district's voting machines until the results can be certified, <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> as saying. There was confusion about the exact vote in <LOCATION> Caddo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, as officials checked and rechecked computer readouts. In addition, Secretary of State <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> that he had talked with federal voting officials about the disqualification of 3,000 Caddo Parish voters between the March 8 primary and Saturday's runoff. <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> said he was told voters can not be disqualified less than six weeks before an election. Most recent polls had given <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> aide, a slight advantage over <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>. The last precincts to report were from the most populous <LOCATION> Shreveport-Bossier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, and the narrow edge they gave <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> was just enough to offset the support <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> received in the seven rural parishes. Turnout was predicted at about 45 percent, said <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, director of the elections division of the secretary of state's office

 <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, 38, is a former lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a former congressional aide to both <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and his predecessor. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 41, is serving his fourth term in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. His ability to campaign actively had been hampered because he was seriously injured in an auto accident March 13. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> vacated the 4th District seat March 14, the day he was inaugurated. The governor, a conservative Democrat, made no public endorsements in the runoff. <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> was also a Democrat until he switched parties last fall in anticipation of running for <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s seat, saying he disagreed with some aspects of the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform. In the March 8 primary, <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> led a field of 10 candidates with 31 percent of the vote, followed by <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> with 19 percent. <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> was the only Republican in the race. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, non-presidential primaries are `` open,'' with all candidates running against one another regardless of party. If no one gets a majority, a runoff is held between the top two vote-getters.

 Democratic presidential candidates set aside their differences during a one hour-debate Saturday and concentrated their fire on the Republican administration, criticizing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on issues ranging from the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the handling of the AIDS epidemic. `` I do n't see any intensity out there for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, entering the final weekend of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> presidential primary as the front-runner in the polls. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the administration had `` a disgraceful record'' in its handling of AIDS. `` We can not just manage Reaganomics, we're going to have to reverse Reaganomics,'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at the debate in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Before flying to the western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> city, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with black businessmen in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and toured an <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Asked why he has spent so little time campaigning in black neighborhoods, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said, `` I understand <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s going to get the lion's share of the votes in this community and that's understandable.'' But, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he had `` always had good support in the black community.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged Indians, who generally do not vote as a matter of principle, to get involved in the nation's political process to improve life on the reservation. `` We want to reach out to them and urge them to vote,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a rally at an Indian museum. `` So many Native Americans have simply been broken-hearted. They've been hurt so long they feel a sense of betrayal. We have to get them involved.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, falling deeper in debt and trailing badly in the polls, began running commercials featuring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> urging voters to `` Vote positive. Vote <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also planned to march with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> on Sunday in a Salute to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> parade, a gesture <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> hopes will help him capture some of the Jewish voters who generally comprise 25 percent of the Democratic primary turnout. The three Democratic candidates, seated on stage at the Eastman Theater on Saturday for the League of Women Voters-sponsored debate, appeared determined to set aside their differences and concentrate on the vulnerabilities of their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent _ virtually certain to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> defended his meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had appealed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and had thanked <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> for releasing a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flier. As for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he got the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader to release political prisoners and said, `` If we have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on the one hand and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> on the other, we should not reduce our influence in our own hemisphere with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' Not even a discussion of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which has produced the sharpest differences between the candidates during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign, could shake their congeniality. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has taken the firmest pro-Israel stand, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until that group renounces terrorism `` such as blowing up school buses with innocent children on them, renouncing that kind of act as an instrument of policy.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been the most sympathetic toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, quickly responded, `` You are right.'' Then he pointed out that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` said he would n't recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> even if they recognized him.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, recalling the step the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> took to end his country's state of war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said, `` I do n't see why it's so difficult for the other Arab leaders to do what <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> did.'' <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> eventually signed a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The candidates greeted each other warmly after the debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> standing on the stage's wing while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> answered questions from reporters, and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> watched from behind a crowd of journalists. `` I was going to ask you, ` when are you going to get off that stage,''' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> joked to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when he finally stepped down. Every published poll of likely <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary voters showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by margins ranging from 6 to nearly 17 percentage points. All the surveys said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was running a distant third. In a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll published Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was supported by 43 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 37 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 13 percent. The survey calculated the responses of 179 likely voters among 392 Democrats interviewed Thursday and Friday. The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 8 percentage points. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> toured a market in the heart of a Polish neighborhood in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and conceded that he is running behind in the state. `` At a minimum we have to have a strong finish to demonstrate continued momentum,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not going to put specific numbers on it.'' He said he thought he had time to improve his standing and added, `` It's a very volatile race.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to sweep the 96 Republican delegates at stake on Tuesday. Half of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delegates were running unopposed. His only remaining opponent for the nomination, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, did not campaign in the state and has said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` going to be the nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> absent any unexpected eventuality.'' While the Democratic candidates were campaigning and debating in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where 255 delegates are at stake, <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, whose favorite son, former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, was an early casualty in the Democratic race, held caucuses on Saturday to allocate 36 delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a strong lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the earliest results from two rural counties in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Those results involved about 300 votes reported by late Saturday night, while an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people were expected to participate in the caucuses. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which use a three-step process to select delegates, on Saturday held state conventions. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Democrats gave two-thirds of their 15 delegates to the uncommitted while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got three and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> two. The state convention was the final step in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s delegate selection process which began with precinct caucuses last month. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where the party completed its delegate-selection process begun with precinct caucuses March 12, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up almost two-third of the delegates on Saturday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came up with 28 delegates, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won eight and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got seven. Allocation of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> delegates will be determined by the outcome of a presidential preference vote at the caucuses. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the only candidate to campaign in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and his state campaign coordinator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said, `` I think we can win <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. People committed to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tend to be more apt to go out and vote.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the backing of many top state Democrats and was the leader in a poll taken several weeks ago. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent neither time nor money in the state. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> borrowed another $ 100,000 from banks in his home state of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, bringing his total campaign debt to $ 1.6 million. Winless since Super Tuesday, when he demonstrated support across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was spending $ 700,000 on advertising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in a bid to get back into contention. The Democratic candidates were scheduled to debate again on Sunday, a televised appearance on <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>. All three also planned to appear at a senior citizen forum sponsored by city council president <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>.

 Arabs enraged by the slaying of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s top aide fought street battles Saturday with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers who killed 15 rioters and wounded scores, Israeli radio reported. Hospital officials put the death toll at 14, with eight killed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and six in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, head of the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, said of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers: `` From reports we have, they used no warning shots, no tear gas, no rubber bullets. They just opened fire.'' A military spokesman said the soldiers fired because their lives were in danger. He described the clashes as `` breaking out spontaneously and with force'' and said demonstrators had thrown many firebombs at troops. Hospitals, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said up to 90 Palestinians were wounded. The army imposed curfews on 10 refugee camps. It was the highest one-day death toll reported since violence began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> strip </LOCATION>, bringing the number of Palestinians reported killed to at least 164. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and civilian also have been slain. Most of the violence was in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, military commander of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, lived until 1963 and close relatives remain. He was killed early Saturday at his home in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, by seven commandos who escaped. Palestinian leaders blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the assassination. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the only party that could have carried out such an act,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` His -LRB- al-Wazir's -RRB- portfolio is the occupied territories. This is an attempt to crush the uprising by force.'' Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused comment. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, who speaks for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said it was `` natural for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to blame <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They always blame <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, an expert on terrorism at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the death of al-Wazir _ also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> -LRB- Father of the Holy War -RRB- _ might have been the result of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> infighting and that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman, probably approved it. Riots began in the occupied territories as soon as news of the assassination was broadcast. Hospital officials said seven Palestinians were shot to death in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and six in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The previous highest death toll was on April 2, when six Palestinians were killed. The Israeli army command confirmed 12 Arab deaths and said troops killed five Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It said seven other Palestinians were slain and it was investigating the circumstances. Black flags of mourning fluttered in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, home of five families related to <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, over streets blocked every few yards by barriers of stones and flaming tires. Mobs of angry young Arabs clutching rocks, blocks of cement, empty tear gas canisters and anything else that could be thrown crowded around approaching cars. Many masked their faces with shirts or Arab headscarves. `` <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> has not been this tense since the beginning of the uprising,'' said a woman who would not given her name. Outside the home of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, the dead man's brother-in-law, about 100 mourners sat under a tent as loudspeakers from a nearby mosque blared mourning verses from the Koran, holy book of Islam <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, were draped over the home's entrance and balcony. More of the red, green, white and black banners hung from poles in the street, obscured occasionally by thick smoke from burning tires. The service was interrupted when mourners spotted Israelis armed with rifles and tear gas at a nearby street corner. `` Come here if you are men!'' the Palestinians shouted, hurling stones. The troopers responded with tear gas, and gunfire was heard. Women in long black mourning dresses screamed at the soldiers. Some carried onions, bottles of cologne or buckets of chlorine, all thought to be remedies for tear gas inhalation. Mourners suddenly rushed at the Israelis, carrying <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and shouting `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>!'' -LRB- God is Great -RRB-. About 30 soldiers charged the protesters, firing tear gas and some live ammunition. The Arabs dispersed in a thick white cloud of tear gas and no casualties were evident. Inside the house, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, the widow's brother, said he had `` no doubts'' of who the killers were and denied allegations of a feud with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Most of the deaths in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> were at refugee camps. Three people were reported killed in the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> camp in the southern <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, two at the nearby <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> camp, and one each at the Bureij refugee camp in the central <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abssan </PERSON> village near <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said three people were killed in the town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and one each at <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, Habla near <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION>.

 The pilot of a commuter plane that caught fire in flight was `` either very lucky, very brave, probably very skilled,'' officials said after a crash-landing that barely missed a crowded airport bar and injured 19 people. Two passengers and their seats were thrown through the side of the <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dash </ORGANIZATION> 8 in the crash Friday night at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Two of the 40 people aboard were in serious condition Saturday. No one on the ground was hurt. `` Everyone was holding hands. I do n't know who the man was next to me, but I sure must have broke his arm holding onto it,'' said passenger <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartzwelder </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> nurse. She said the plane flew five or 10 minutes before she saw the right engine on fire. The propeller-driven plane narrowly missed the airport control tower. Then it made a hard landing and careened into a boarding ramp. The plane crashed through baggage carts `` like a bowling alley,'' then headed for the busy B Concourse Bar, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadd </PERSON>, 29, manager of a restaurant overlooking the B Concourse. `` If it would have been a few feet the other way, the nose would have went right into the bar, and this is their busiest night,'' <PERSON> Chadd </PERSON> said. However, a wing punched through a passenger ramp at an empty <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> gate where <PERSON> Chadd </PERSON> said a flight had departed about 10 minutes earlier. Eight investigators were sent from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, along with board member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>, to handle the investigation, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously, the focus -LRB- of the probe -RRB- is centered in the right engine,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. A 2-by-3-foot panel from the ravaged right engine was found Saturday about a mile and a half from the airport, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. The panel, used to gain access to the engine for maintenance or repairs, was the only piece of the plane found outside the airport. Horizon President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the accident resulted in the first passenger injuries in the airline's seven-year history. He said the incident was the third in 19 months involving the turboprop engines on the Dash 8. In June, an engine fire was detected shortly after takeoff, and in 1986 a plane returned to <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> when an engine malfunctioned, he said. The incidents involved different aircraft among the airline's 10 Dash 8s, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Officials at the de Havilland division of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, manufacturer of the engines on the Dash 8, said in telephone interviews they knew of no recurrent problems with the aircraft or its engines. Horizon Flight 2658 had just taken off on a flight from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> with a full load of 37 passengers, plus three crew members, said <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. The plane was about three miles from the airport when pilot <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> reported `` a hot engine,'' radio jargon for a fire, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The plane `` almost hit the -LRB- <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> -RRB- control tower,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> air traffic control center in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. `` The controllers thought he was going to hit it.'' `` They had a fire truck waiting and the flames were out in about 15 seconds,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. `` It could have been a lot worse,'' said air traffic controller <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobosa </PERSON>. `` We consider the pilot either very lucky, very brave, probably very skilled. It was pretty quick.'' Before the plane hit the ground, `` there was very little talking,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenstam </PERSON>, 42, of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I heard someone in front comforting someone else, but there were no screams.'' When the plane hit, `` I heard the boom. They told us to put our heads down and shield our faces. Everybody was real calm,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Swartzwelder </PERSON>. The flight attendant `` did a good job'' of explaining how passengers should hold their heads down, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Clarkston </LOCATION>. The plane came down hard, careened across a runway, some grass and the tarmac, then hit the boarding ramp. What passengers heard was `` basically a piece of metal scraping concrete, a lot of bumps, a lot of noise,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, 43, of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lowenstam </PERSON> said two passengers and their seats were ejected from the plane on impact. `` After we crashed, the whole seat to our right was thrown out the side of the plane,'' <PERSON> Lowenstan </PERSON> said. `` The whole right side of the aircraft basically came apart in several places,'' said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. In addition to the man in serious condition after chest surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Harborview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, officials said at least 18 were injured. Four people in all remained hospitalized Saturday. None of the injuries was considered life-threatening. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, was treated at <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for back pain and released, a nursing supervisor said. He declined to discuss the crash Friday night. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harborview </LOCATION>, where most of those aboard the plane were taken, said most passengers were from north-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refused comment Sunday on reports that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and two other high Israeli officials approved the assassination of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy commander. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television, quoting unidentified sources, reported Saturday's assassination of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> military leader <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> was a joint operation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intelligence service, the Mossad, and naval and army units. The report, aired Saturday night, said the attack was approved by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> after <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three Israelis in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert last month. `` This story has the same status as all the other stories like it which have been published, and we do n't relate to any of them,'' spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mossad </PERSON> had asked three times for permission to kill <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, but that each time <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials refused to give permission. That changed after the bus attack, the network reported. The former head of a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> intelligence unit praised the assassination and suggested in an interview Sunday with <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that al - <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> had been an Israeli target in past years <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>, who stepped down from the unit over the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> spy scandal in 1985, said, `` I have always honored doing justice to those people responsible for terrorist attacks.'' Israeli experts say <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> was responsible for a list of bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijacking in which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded. His assassination touched off a wave of protests in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Saturday. At least 15 people were killed and up to 90 wounded in the bloodiest single day of Palestinian rioting since protests began Dec. 8. <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON> also said `` there is no doubt there is a parallel'' between the methods of Saturday's assassination and the 1973 slaying of <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adwan </PERSON>, by Israeli commandos in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Palestinian officials have cited the similarity between the two commando raids as showing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was involved in <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON> headed `` The <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>,'' an intelligence unit which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said it dismantled in 1985 for its involvement in recruiting former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> to spy for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> is serving a life sentence after being convicted of selling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hundreds of secret American intelligence documents, including information about Arab targets. In an interview published this week by an army weekly, the head of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military intelligence, Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON>, who commanded the 1973 <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> raid, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had a policy of striking at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla leaders. `` In my opinion whoever leads acts of terror is a proper target for liquidation. Whoever uses terrorism against us, should be a target,'' <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON> told the magazine `` Bamahane.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported firing seven missiles against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and another Iranian city Sunday and said it had launched an offensive to recapture the Iranian-occupied port of Faw. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> confirmed the attacks but said Iraqi troops were retreating from the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Iraqi forces `` are engaged in an epic battle to liberate Faw,'' said the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in an urgent dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. It gave no other details of the attack except that the operation launched on the first day of the monthlong Moslem feast of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> was named `` Blessed Ramadan.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Iraqi troops suffered `` hundreds of casualties'' in the land attack. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Iraqis retreated after trying to infiltrate Iranian positions. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port of Faw, in the northernmost reach of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, was captured by Iranian forces that thrust across the wide Shatt-Al-Arab estuary in a major offensive in January and February 1986. The seizure of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION>, 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second largest city and major port, has been regarded as the most important Iranian victory in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war Earlier, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported firing six long-range missiles into the Iranian capital of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> at 11.30 a.m. -LRB- 3:30 a.m. EDT -RRB-. It said a seventh missile was fired later in the day against the city of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, confirmed the missile strikes against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, saying these were fired `` at different intervals before noon.'' The radio added that `` several civilians were killed or wounded in these attacks,'' which also caused `` substantial damage to commercial and residential buildings, shops and vehicles.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has fired at least 120 missiles on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since Feb. 29, when the two nations intensified bombings of cities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it responded to the Saturday attacks by firing two missiles into the Iraqi capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iraqi news agency also reported Sunday that one of two Iranian warplanes raiding cities in the Kurdish region of northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> the previous day was shot down by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defenses. The agency said the raids were directed against residential areas in the cities of <LOCATION> Erbil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dohuk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dukan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday's air raids were in retaliation for Iraqi missile strikes and air raids against `` civilian areas'' of Iranian cities.

<TEXT>
 Shiite Moslem gunmen who have threatened to fly a hijacked Kuwaiti jet and about 35 hostages out of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> said Sunday they were extending their `` departure time warning'' to pursue negotiations. Airport personnel were preparing to fill the plane's tanks with about 6,600 gallons of fuel to maintain conditions inside the plane, where the hostages were being held for a 13th day. The hijackers did not set a new deadline. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Airways Flight 422, with 112 people on board, was hijacked April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The plane spent three days in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and arrived here early Wednesday. The gunmen killed two passengers in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. They released 57 hostages at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, 13 at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> and one on Friday in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. The hijackers earlier asked for the fuel by 11 a.m. -LRB- 6 a.m. EDT -RRB-. In a brief statement in Arabic to the control tower, the hijackers said, `` At the request of our brothers the Algerians we announce that we have agreed to extend the departure time warning to give an opportunity for the efforts by the Algerians.'' An Algerian negotiator boarded the blue and white <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 for 15 minutes, leaving the aircraft at 11:10 a.m. -LRB- 6:10 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Inside the airport terminal building, Algerian Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON> pursued negotiations with a high-level <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation. On Saturday, the hijackers said they would ask that the plane be refueled `` to settle our score with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> somewhere else.'' `` We do not want the massacre to take place here in friendly <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which welcomed us and which tried to settle the problem,'' they said Saturday. The hijackers are demanding freedom for 17 terrorists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for the 1983 bombings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there. Shortly after the threat, <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government asked Algerian authorities to prevent the plane from leaving. The new activity came as Moslems prepared to observe <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, the month-long period of fasting when Islamic values are particularly stressed. It starts here on Monday. It was not immediately clear how the holiday might affect negotiations or the fate of the hostages. Three members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family are among the hostages. There are believed to be about eight hijackers, one or two of whom may have boarded in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has a record of negotiating solutions to hostage situations. It successfully gained the release in 1981 of Americans held at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days.

 Fear of the night, two-job couples and the mobile society are taking their toll on door-to-door solicitations for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, fund-raisers say. `` People do n't know their neighbors like they once did,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Swimm </PERSON>, who is holding an open house to raise money this year after more than 20 years of door-to-door canvassing. `` So many people now work, it's hard to find neighbors at home during the day and nobody wants to go out at night.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swimm </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and is the society's state chairman for residential fund-raising, said local chapters decide how to raise funds. `` Residential contributions have been going down,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newburyport </LOCATION> who heads the state cancer drive. `` It was getting more and more difficult to get volunteers.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said house-to-house canvassing last year brought in about $ 400,000, compared to $ 800,000 five years ago. Some volunteers are concerned about safety and residents are more reluctant to open doors to strangers. Some apartment buildings ban canvassers. `` Family structures have changed,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, society national vice president. `` Two-income families have reduced the time people spend in their neighborhood. `` They do n't form the tight acquaintanceships they used to. And people are less likely to volunteer in strange neighborhoods.'' As a result, many of the society's chapters are using lunches, dinners, road races, house parties and walkathons to replace door-knocking. But some <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> groups are sticking to tradition. The cancer society's <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION> chapter reported 51,000 canvassers have signed up to knock on doors this year.

<HEAD>Centenarians Discuss Memories, Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When asked to recall his most distant memories, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Everist </PERSON> went way back to the early days of electric light. <PERSON> Everist </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, remembered being six years old when he saw <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s revolutionary invention, the incandescent lamp, at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair in 1893. His recollections are among those of two dozen other people who turned 100 years old in 1987 and responded to <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth annual survey of centenarian policyholders. Oddly, of the 85 people who were contacted for the survey, there was only one common surname _ Young. `` We could all learn something from the youthful spirit and zest for life exhibited by many of those people who have already lived full lives,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuenke </PERSON>, president of the insurance company, said recently in making the results of the survey public. Such youthful spirit was reported by <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who said he still plays golf, pulls his own cart and regularly hits drives around 150 yards. In his lifetime, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said he has had seven holes-in-one, including one at age 94. <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquart </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Crestline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, did not learn to drive until she was 62. Although her vision deteriorated, making her nearly blind for the past 20 years, she described how she has listened to `` talking books'' and has memorized poems. Other memories reported by the respondents included seeing President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> give a speech, attending college with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> and decorating a Christmas tree with real candles. Many said the secret to their longevity was a healthy diet, a good spouse and high moral standards. Also, more than half of the centenarians noted that their parents had lived at least beyond age 80, and several reported that both parents lived beyond 90. But <PERSON> Adah </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said she `` has n't the faintest idea'' how she reached the century mark. `` Being 100 years old has not been, to me, a time for creating philosophy,'' she wrote. `` It was a surprise to me to reach my 100th birthday, but I do n't think in terms of years. I think in terms of friends and occasions.''

 The captain of the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, in his first phone call to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the ship struck a mine in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, said he was told to abandon ship twice. But Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said his crew of `` heroes'' saved a ship that was hit so hard her stern rose 15 feet in the air and flames shot 100 feet through her stacks. `` It was close, really close,'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said. `` We took a very bad hit.'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>'s account of the Thursday incident came during a 15-minute phone call Saturday to his wife, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>, who traveled to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for a dinner held by the crew members' wives About 25 wives were at the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> home of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, not expecting any calls. Then around 2 p.m., the crews' call came. <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> did not say who told him to abandon ship, but spent most of the call praising what he called a well-trained crew who saved everyone's lives. `` The crew did exactly what they were supposed to do,'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said. `` We put out the fires and stopped the flooding.'' Crew members related stories about the hit in their first phone calls home since the ship pulled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> on Saturday. While everyone was a hero, the men said, they mentioned two stars _ Chief Petty Officers <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bent </PERSON> _ who saved the lives of three men. One of the men was <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who was drowning in a pool of oil and water when <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> and Bent pulled him out. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was in serious condition with back injuries. His wife said Saturday that he is in a body cast. Lt. <PERSON> Gordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, who spoke to his wife <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, said the blast came just 20 seconds after the crew had assumed battle stations. <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> ordered battle stations after three mines were detected. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said he was thrown four feet into the air. Another crew member, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, said he was thrown into the ceiling. The wives learned that their husbands were in line on the ship to use the phone, so they lined up in the hallway ouside <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s bedroom in the same order, passing the phone down the line in a 2 -LCB- - hour conversation

<HEAD>General Assembly Protects Privacy of Video Viewers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Viewer privacy, which suddenly became an issue when <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s videocassette rental choices turned up in print, would be protected under a bill passed by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Legislation on the issue is pending in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and in both houses of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> bill, which awaits the governor's signature, is thought to be the first enacted in the nation that would penalize a retail video establishment for violating a viewer's privacy. It would impose up to a $ 500 penalty and maximum six-month jail term on anyone who released information about what a person had purchased or rented for use on a home videocassette player. Last year a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> publication's story listed the movies <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and his family had rented from a local movie rental shop. The story showed the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> family had a penchant for mystery movies, but raised questions about whether such information should be made available, particularly in cases of X-rated movie rentals. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> law sets up exceptions for authorized law enforcement personnel, collection agencies, or individuals designated by the customer. Video industry representatives say they support the bill as a privacy protection measure. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpel </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said his group was `` generally supportive'' of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> bill and had been tracking its progress. `` We've done a lot of work on this at the federal level. Other states are considering it; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering it,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> bill was passed in the closing days of the session earlier this month and Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> is expected to sign it. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted last Tuesday to add a video privacy amendment to an uncontroversial bill expanding the confidentiality of public library records. One of the federal bills has been in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since Oct 21, 1987, while a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill remains in draft form. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version sets up civil, rather than criminal penalties, and allows a video customer to seek up to $ 2,500 in damages. Vans <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Erol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest volume speciality video retailer in the nation, said his organization's president had written to a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> delegate to express support for the privacy bill, which dovetails with the firm's own policy `` Customer rental and sales are privileged,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. `` We applied your -LRB- <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s -RRB- proposal to formally protect what we believe has always been a reasonable expectation and right of privacy for the video customer. The bill essentially mirrors the policy we have.'' His company does n't handle X-rated or pornographic videotapes that might be the target of some inquiries. However, he said he believes that regardless of what categories of videotapes they handle, the majority of video retailers follow similar policies. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said computerized records of video transactions are held in <PERSON> Erol </PERSON>'s stores 30 days, then put in an offsite vault. Store employees are instructed not to respond to questions about an individual's membership in the video club or to release information to reporters or creditors, he said. All releases of information are made through headquarters. `` We do n't release membership lists. We do n't sell lists,'' he said. `` The only information we actually use are aggregate numbers, certain titles, like how many times did ` Robocop' run?''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and raise taxes on the rich. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would shoot down the Midgetman missile and hire more tax collectors. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would consider a tax on luxuries, but supports some weapons his rivals oppose. The budget and defense policy are not the only areas in which the three surviving challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination differ. Among the others: abortion, education, taxes and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, particularly, has been a topic of considerable concern as the candidates head into Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. In 1984, Jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the civil rights activist, has taken the most consistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues, and has offered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, also has embraced many liberal social ideas, including universal health insurance, but has suggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forging partnerships with the private sector. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has staked out the more conservative stances on military and foreign policy issues, and has been the most outspoken supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and opponent of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. He has gained expertise on arms control during 12 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where he has compiled a liberal voting record on labor, environment and health issues. Here is a look at where the Democrats stand on key issues:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would make the wealthiest 600,000 taxpayers pay at a rate of 38.5 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33 percent. He also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, `` No serious candidate for president can rule out the possibility of new taxes.'' But he says the first step is to hire more <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and `` collect every dollar we can of that $ 110 billion that's not being paid today.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for those making more than $ 200,000 a year. `` If we are driven as a last resort to new taxes, I will fight to ensure that we turn first to those who can afford it,'' says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has suggested raising nearly $ 1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items, $ 10 billion by keeping corporate taxes at their current level and $ 5 billion by taxing the sale of inherited stocks on the basis of their original value. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supports an oil import fee; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has not ruled one out. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a vociferous opponent of such a tariff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUDGET DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> claims he could reduce the deficit by $ 100 billion annually by 1993 by freezing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for five years and by his tax increases on the wealthy. But he has also proposed major increases in social spending. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would scale back Star Wars research and save $ 50 billion by scrapping the Midgetman missile. He says he would trim federal programs and squeeze out waste, but cautions, `` We're not going to get major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget. It's been savaged over the past seven years.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> says he would `` convene a summit of our nation's leaders on economics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle our budget deficit.'' He proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail, cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating `` the $ 40 billion of unnecessary medical diagnostics'' that the government pays for each year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 All three candidates oppose the Strategic Defense Initiative. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would scale back basic research in the field to pre-Star Wars levels. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> proposes saving $ 40 billion by not building two new aircraft carrier task forces, and `` tens of billions of dollars'' by negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets. He opposes building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber, the Trident D-5 missile, or any more MX missiles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the Midgetman. He contends that until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces, savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> non-nuclear forces. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the B-1 bomber, but favors development of the Stealth bomber. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is a stalwart supporter of the single-warhead Midgetman missile, and helped win congressional approval for it in exchange for limiting production of the multi-warhead MX missile to 50. Like his rivals, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> opposed military aid to the Contras, but has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> fought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to revive the B-1 bomber, then voted to limit production to 100.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> does not support creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has refused to rule it out. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supports an independent homeland for Palestians. All three say the Arab nations must recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who once met with <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, now says he would not do it again. But he calls current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy `` fatally flawed'' and favors `` an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> involving all the parties concerned, including the chosen representatives of the Palestinian people.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders' refusal to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to blame for the current Palestinian strife; he says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> refused to join 30 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in sending a letter of protest to the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> government on its handling of the unrest; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would have signed the letter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fully support women's legal right to abortion and federal funding for abortions. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> opposes a constitutional ban on abortions, but has voted to limit federal tax dollars for abortions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would double the $ 21 billion <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> budget and expand Head Start and other programs so that all disadvantaged children could take part. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed scholarships to attract more students into teaching, and new tax breaks for families to save for college. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as called for more federal support for schools and Head Start, but also suggested a longer school year and that teachers be more accountable.

 Police shot and killed one person and injured 12 others during a riot near <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> on the final day of local council elections, an independent newspaper said Sunday. A total of nine people died and nearly 500 were injured during the eight days of voting, which ended Saturday. Last week's voting in 5,000 election districts had been postponed because of violence on Feb. 10, when the country's other 16,000 districts elected their local councils. At least 100 people died and 5,000 were injured in the February election violence. Saturday's shooting was in the <LOCATION> Goainhat </LOCATION> district near <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION>, 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the Bengali-language <PERSON> Khabar </PERSON> said. The newspaper said police were trying to stop a riot in which supporters of rival candidates injured about 100 people with bombs and bricks near the voting center. Election commission sources in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> said voting in dozens of districts were postponed again last week because of violence. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were unable to give an exact number or to say when a third attempt to conduct elections in those districts would be made. Council elections are not conducted along party lines, but the contests are heated because of the amount of local power and patronage involved.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preached his first sermon in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a fundamentalist teaching on the meaning of the cross, to more than 1,500 believers in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> church Sunday morning. `` I would like to bring greetings to you from Christians all over the world,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said at the start of his hour-long sermon, which was immediately translated into Chinese. `` Christians all over the world know about the church in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They think about you and they pray for you,'' he said. The 69-year-old Southern Baptist minister arrived five days ago for his first visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for Friendship with Foreign Countries.

But the church's main and side sanctuaries were full, and latecomers had to stand at the back, in the aisles and in the foyer. Some were Chinese who usually worship at other <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> churches, but many were foreigners, including a group of 27 Taiwanese Presbyterians from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The Chinese, many of whom nod off during the hour-and-a-half-long sermons by Chinese pastors, listened attentively to <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s message. `` I think he was very good,'' said second-year seminary student <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiuqiu </PERSON>. `` What he said hits right to the heart.'' Her classmate, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Guoxiong </PERSON>, said: `` He lifted up the name of God. His message was <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preached that a person's heart changes when he becomes a Christian. `` You have a great modernization program in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It is my prayer that there will be a great moral modernization program also because that goes right to the heart.''

<HEAD>Senate May Curb Lobbying Lure for Government Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is talking seriously about putting a padlock on the revolving door through which government officials step into high-paying lobbying jobs, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s best-known fringe benefits. Two top White House aides, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, walked through that door, only to run afoul of current strictures against influence peddling. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was convicted of lying about his activities; <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted of lobbying former colleagues too soon after he quit. Countless generals and colonels have retired from the military and taken their inside knowledge and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> phone books to new jobs with defense contractors. Political appointees and career bureaucrats, similarly, can be regulators one day and employees of the regulated the next. Several key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have quit in recent years to join prestigious <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firms or head trade associations _ thence returning to the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as lobbyists to trade on their friendships. `` It's endemic to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, a liberal Democrat from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> who has joined forces with conservative Republican <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in trying to stem the practice. `` One day you're a public servant and the next day you turn around and you're peddling your influence,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> says. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Metzenbaum-Thurmond </ORGANIZATION> measure, intended to strengthen the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, on appeal, is challenging the constitutionality of the current law _ and presumably any successor _ on ground that it impinges the right of free speech. The pending legislation is a landmark proposal in one respect. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has consistently exempted itself from a variety of laws, including the 1978 ethics statute, but it would be covered by the anti-lobbying features of the new bill. `` That's the way it should be,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said Friday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began debate on the bill. `` It's time we police ourselves,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., another cosponsor of the bill The 1978 law says, in principle, that a top-level executive branch person can not lobby in his or her former agency for at least a year after leaving the job. But the law lets the Office of Government Ethics define the prohibited territory. Under its most recent rulings, a person who worked in one section of the White House is free to immediately lobby the other eight defined by OGE. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> has noted, unhappily, that if he had been accorded the benefit of the latest interpretation, he could not have been charged in the first place, since he did n't lobby the same White House office from which he resigned. By OGE's interpretation, there are 200 sections of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meaning an official who leaves one could lobby the other 199 without problem. The Metzenbaum-Thurmond bill would change all that. It would put departing members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, all high-ranking judicial employees and an estimated 45 senior administration officials on the sidelines for a year _ when absolutely no lobbying of any branch of the government would be allowed. Political appointees like assistant Cabinet secretaries and heads of independent agencies would be barred from lobbying the executive branch for a year. Career employees earning more than $ 64,397 could n't lobby their former agencies for a year. OGE would no longer be able to divide agencies into sections. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides earning over $ 64,397 _ there are 350 to 400 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> alone _ would face a similar prohibition. Current law is silent about lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. The bill would ban this activity for 18 months by former high-level executive and legislative branch employees. Penalties would be increased. Now, the maximum is two years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine for a criminal conviction. The bill would push this to five years and $ 250,000. A convicted defendant could also be forced to pay twice what was earned through illegal lobbying. `` This will make government a place of public service, not a halfway House for making contacts,'' said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>. `` While influence peddling may have reached new lows, it's not unique to any administration ... -LRB- although -RRB- the ` sleaze factor' has become a new household phrase.'' Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, is opposing the bill, calling it `` a compilation of slogans, misplaced suggestions and muddled thinking. ... It's possibly unconstitutional and bad public policy.'' `` This bill is so draconian that many distinguished Americans ... simply will not come into government,'' said <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, who succeeded Friday in getting supporters to agree to amendments that may make the proposal even tougher to get through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. One amendment would make it illegal for attorneys to even practice before a federal court for a year after leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or a top government job. Another would prohibit outside jobs by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has a rule against this, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does n't. A third <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> amendment would repeal the law that allows members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> elected before 1980 to keep excess campaign funds for personal use, so long as they pay income tax on the money.

<HEAD>Timing of Iran-Contra Trial Could Play Role in Reaction to Pardons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The timing of the Iran-Contra criminal trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> could play a major role in determining public reaction to a pardon by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, experts say. However, the experts disagree whether a pretrial or post-trial pardon _ if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should decide to take that course _ would be more acceptable to Americans. Some of the university professors and senators interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said pardons before trial would be more acceptable. This way, the prosecution would not get a chance to bring out potentially damaging evidence. But others said pardons before trial would bring an immediate assumption of guilt, and they suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> await a conviction if he wanted to forgive the defendants. If there is no trial or verdict by next January, according to this view, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should leave office without taking action. The issue is not merely an academic argument, because the trial date is a hotly contested pretrial matter in the courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said last week he'll by ready for trial in July, but the defense team sought a March 1989 trial date for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer; <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser; and two men recruited by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The four face charges that they stole government property as they conducted secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and aided the Nicaraguan Contras during congressional bans on such assistance. The 23-count indictment charges the four ran the Iran-Contra affair as a broad criminal conspiracy to defraud the government and to cover up their actions. North, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are accused of personally enriching themselves as a result of the Iran-Contra affair. Taking the view that a pretrial pardon would be the right course, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellinger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, said, `` If the prosecution can prove the heart of this case, which is more about embezzlement than aiding the Contras, pardons will cause a much greater storm -LRB- after trial -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Dellinger </PERSON> added, `` This may look like a very different case after trial than it did after the congressional hearings, one the public is far less likely to view charitably.'' Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said pardons would be `` tougher to justify'' before trial. The defendants would be `` presumed guilty all the time'' if pardoned before trial, <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> suggested. If the trial has not begun when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January, <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said, the defendants would `` have to rely on the good will of another president.'' Citing former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s pardon of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said he's `` not sure'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` wants to make his place in history by pardoning people. It did n't do <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> any good.'' The pardon may have cost <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> the presidential election of 1976 and is the most remembered act of his presidency. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not taken an official position on pardoning any of the defendants. On April 6, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I have raised the issue with the president four or five times myself. I've heard it raised by others, and every time the president says the same thing, which is, ` I'm not discussing pardons.''' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said pardons would be easier before a trial to `` spare <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this pain'' of reliving the Iran-Contra affair in the courtroom. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra committee. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuchtenburg </PERSON>, professor of history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said a pretrial pardon would be more difficult for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` because of the gaffe'' he made on March 25 _ when he appeared to prejudge the case by predicting an innocent verdict. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said then, `` I still think <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is a hero'' and added, `` I just have to believe they're going to be found innocent because I do n't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any crime.'' Later that day, White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was expressing a personal view, adding, `` I think the president made it abundantly clear that he expects the legal process to run its course.'' <PERSON> Leuchtenburg </PERSON> said the worst scenario for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be if a trial was under way at the time he's ready to leave office. `` That would create an all but impossible situation for a pardon,'' he said. `` That would really produce a cry of outrage. It would particularly disturb the legal community by taking something away from the legal process, and undercutting the judge and jury.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> political science professor, said `` Pardoning in advance of their trial is wrong. The evidence is the wrongness recognized by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s pardon of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. There was surprise that the president's rating plummeted so fast after the public rallied around him as the new president. `` Some people say you go down in history. Some say you get written up in history. I would suspect if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did it -LRB- grant pardons -RRB-, it would be a mark on the scroll of history, but on the down side.''

 House investigators Sunday recommended tightening government ethics laws in the wake of involvement by two former administration officials in allowing a now-defunct, multimillion-dollar health care operation to sidestep Medicare rules. Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the case involving former presidential aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> and the Florida-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is `` a classic case of conflict of interest, involving greedy federal officials whose selfish actions could have caused great harm to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients.'' A House Government Operations subcommittee headed by <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> alleged that after he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> received at least $ 300,000 from the company to try to influence officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The subcommittee's investigative report said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> lobbied <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> to waive for IMC a legal requirement that at least half the enrollees of a health maintenance organization, or HMO, which offers prepaid health care, be private rather than Medicare patients. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON>, who was then acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, overruled his staff and waived the 50 percent rule. After he left the Medicare agency, the report said, <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> received a $ 40,000 consultant's fee from IMC. The 50 percent regulation is intended to ensure that HMOs treating <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients are competent enough to attract private clients. IMC had been receiving $ 360 million a year from Medicare to provide health care for 130,000 of its up to 200,000 members, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> that seized control of the company and sold its operations to <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION>, a large health-care firm based in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> has been charged with any crime in their dealings with IMC. Both have been sentenced on other charges, however. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> on April 8 was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined $ 30,000 for illegally lobbying high-level administration officials on three other occasions after he resigned his White House job as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political director. <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> pleaded guilty last July to conflict of interest violations involving accepting $ 33,450 from a private foundation, and was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined $ 15,000. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> has challenged the current ethics laws and denied any impropriety in his lobbying activities. <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> in the past has declined to discuss IMC. `` My greatest concern is that current ethics laws may continue to allow the kinds of conflicts found in the report,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` Ethics law reform should include provisions to close these loopholes.'' The report also said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON> quit his post as general counsel at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to become a $ 325,000-a-year executive with IMC. The company was dropped from the Medicare program in May 1987 after its president, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Recarey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was indicted on labor racketeering charges. Since he fled the country, <PERSON> Recarey </PERSON> has been indicted on additional charges of embezzling more than $ 350,000 from the Medicare program. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION> received $ 11.9 million in government overpayments because of the negligence of officials in <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON>'s former agency At its peak, <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION> had the highest number of Medicare participants of any HMO in the country _ its 130,000 patients live in five <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties _ and had received $ 977 million from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> in the six years before it was suspended.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Production, Demand for Natural Gas Expected to Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domestic crude oil production in the 1990s should be higher than previously expected and demand for natural gas will be markedly higher, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s annual forecast The department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said oil prices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected in last year's forecast, and natural gas prices will be much lower. The import share of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum consumption wo n't be much different at the end of the century from what was predicted last year, <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> said. In their annual forecast released last week, the agency's forecasters significantly raised prediction for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil production in the year 2000 from 5.4 million barrels a day to 6.0 million barrels Last year's production was about 8.3 million barrels compared with 9.0 million barrels before the 1986 petroleum price collapse. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, in charge of the petroleum forecast, said in an interview Friday, `` There is no way you can avoid a decline'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production by the year 2000. Any major discoveries off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, areas where explorers have high hopes, could not be in significant production before then, he said. `` We have been significantly influenced here'' by the work of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> reported last year that drilling efficiencies or finding rates _ barrels of oil per foot of exploratory well drilled _ have been remarkably stable, instead of declining as many predicted. Farmer, using slightly different calculations than <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, said drillers are finding 25 barrels of crude oil per foot drilled, and have been finding between 25 and 30 barrels for the past 10 years. In 1986, the most recent year for which full drilling statistics are available, drilling dropped off drastically. But efficiency `` did n't change much,'' and may have blipped upward as the least effective drilling rigs were idled, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. The projections say crude oil, now about $ 18 a barrel, will reach $ 20.37 in 1994 and $ 30.76 in 2000. Last year's forecast predicted that $ 20 a barrel would be reached in 1992, and the price in 2000 would be $ 32.87. These prices are average cost to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refineries of imported supplies in dollars of 1987 buying power. Demand for petroleum products, including natural gas liquids, should reach 18.3 million barrels a day in 2000 compared with last year's projection of 17.4 million barrels. Demand last year was about 16.5 million barrels per day. Imports, which were 35 percent of consumption last year, should be about 56 percent in 2000, only a slight revision from last year's prediction of 55 percent. In a major revision for natural gas, consumption of 19.7 trillion cubic feet per day was predicted for 2000, when the average wellhead price is expected to be $ 4 per thousand cubic feet. Last year's forecast said the nation would use 18 trillion cubic feet of gas in 2000 at a price of $ 5.50. Consumption last year was about 16.8 trillion cubic feet, and the current average wellhead price is about $ 1.75. Usage has never reached the peaks of the early 1970s, 23 trillion cubic feet, and probably wo n't get that high again in this century. `` This year's view is based on the flexibility gas producers have demonstrated recently in meeting competition, both from other gas suppliers and from suppliers of other fuels,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> analysts wrote. `` Increases -LRB- in consumption -RRB- after 1995 are likely to be especially significant as competitive natural gas prices and the increased use of -LRB- gas-burning -RRB- combined cycle units by electric utilities push demand for this fuel upward.'' Predicted coal use was reduced slightly, from 1.2 billion tons in 2000 to 1.1 billion tons. The report noted the entry of new producing countries in world trade such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which will compete with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. The petroleum demand projection assumes that new cars, currently averaging 27 miles per gallon, will average 34 mpg in the year 2000, and that people will use cars and trucks about as much as they do now. Economic growth, expressed as the average annual change in the gross national product, was predicted to be 2.3 percent per year in the new forecast vs. 2.4 percent last year. The report also assumes that the overall energy efficiency of the economy should improve, though more slowly than in the recent past. The energy used for a dollar's production of goods and services, which fell by 2.5 percent per year from 1976 through 1986, will fall at 1.0 percent per year, the report said.

<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said Sunday the department will expand its airplane-to-airplane inspection to a second <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, beginning Monday. The planned inspection comes less than a week after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> began checking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a major carrier in the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> empire _ the nation's largest airline company. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also slapped Eastern with $ 823,000 in fines for violating safety regulations. `` We're going to extend the ramp inspections, intensive inspection, that we began on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as well, beginning tomorrow,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> head said the inquiry will `` be just like the Eastern investigation.'' `` We'll have people who'll be walking around the planes and through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily identified is correct,'' he said. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the department found `` almost a million dollars'' in violations by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> during a review of the carrier's files at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The violations, including some that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> identified itself, are `` being acted on,'' he said. `` They've swept their system and they've found in varying stages we've got almost a million dollars in proposed penalties against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` And in fairness, I should add some of those at least were areas where <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> volunteered that they had problems.'' The airline has been notified of the penalties, according to <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>, and is considering whether to pay them voluntarily. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, said the planned inspections were not a surprise, but promised that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would cooperate with the department as Eastern has done. `` I'm not surprised in light of the environment that's going on right now,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> program. `` I think it's important to note that most of these incidents that the secretary refers to are more than a year old, but <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will comply and do well under this just like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> reported that the department had inspected about 200 of the 267 Eastern aircraft since Wednesday and grounded 19 of them. `` I think it's important to note that grounding does not mean that the plane is still on the ground,'' he said. `` All it means that a problem was identified and a problem was corrected before the plane returned to service.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> head refused to speculate on whether the 19 groundings, which represent about 10 percent of the planes inspected, reflect an average or bad record. `` We want to go through this for 30 days and see what we find and then we'll talk about patterns. ... I've got to emphasize that virtually all the problems identified, and while many of them were significant problems, were easily correctable so the plane was returned to service in a couple of hours,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. The department also launched an investigation Wednesday into the finances and management of the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the department's concerns were raised by evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> `` are under substantial, increasing financial pressure.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had record losses of $ 466 million last year and its Eastern subsidiary has been plagued with labor turmoil. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, the company also owns <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Britt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Provincetown-Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

 Newspaper Industry Failing To Meet Minority Goal
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new survey shows the newspaper industry is falling far short of its goal of making minority employment in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the country by the end of the century. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> indicates a slow growth in minority newspaper employees in the past decade. The percentage of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the newsroom is 7.02 percent this year, the survey found, up from 6.56 percent in 1987 and 3.95 percent in 1978, the first year the survey was done. But, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- American-Statesman and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION>'s minorities committee, said last week, `` Such continued improvement is still not enough to meet the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> goal.'' The minority population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the year 2000 is expected to be at least 25 percent. Minorities made up about 20 percent of the population in the 1980 census. In a report to the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> convention, <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said the survey also found that whites still dominate supervisory positions at newspapers, with 95.9 percent of supervisors white and 4.1 percent minorities. Down the ladder, 93.4 percent of copy editors, 92 percent of reporters and 90.7 percent of photographers are white. The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> study also showed that the majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> daily newspapers still have no minority professionals on their staffs, with minority hiring slowest at papers with circulations under 25,000. `` Obviously,'' <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said, `` much needs to be done.'' <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION>, singled out the poor minority-hiring record of small newspapers in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> convention. `` This is deplorable,'' she said, `` And it is a weakness which must be corrected if we are to serve this country as we should.'' The survey's findings also drew criticism from the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,000-member group based in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It's clear to me that whatever they are doing, they're not getting the results we so desperately want,'' said <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>, president of the black journalists group and a columnist for <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The media plays a vital role in society. We shape what people know about our society,'' <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> added. `` And if the media is manned by white men, then the perceptions the public gets will be filtered through those people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> survey is considered the most reliable measure of minority employment at daily newspapers. This year's figures were based on responses from 1,092 newspapers, representing 67 percent of the 1,630 dailies in the country. The responses were projected to the industry as a whole. The group said it did a follow-up study of non-respondents two years ago and found that the projections were accurate within three-tenths of a percentage point. The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> began surveying minority employment in 1978. That was also the year the group adopted the goal of making the percentage of minorities in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the nation by the year 2000. <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> told the convention that the number of minority employees is not the only measure of a newspaper's commitment to minorities. `` The industry needs to remind itself that this is an issue that goes beyond head count. You have to consider your coverage. ... You have to find a way of making minorities part of the content-making decisions,'' he said.

 The Democratic presidential candidates are spending as much as $ 1,000 per second to reach <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television viewers _ and hoping their messages are n't buried by local coverage of gaffes and controversies. The richest trove of voters is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But that's also where the TV prices are the highest, the media outlets are the most plentiful and rambunctious, and the background noise often explodes into the foreground. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner, is trying to communicate competence and experience with his television advertisements. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> makes a populist appeal to minorities, union members and farmers, while <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> takes tough lines on trade and drugs. But voters are also learning what Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> thinks of Jews who support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, how Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> should conduct his campaign, and why neither has endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. They are pondering <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s reservations about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lack of government experience, charges and counter-charges about the use of nuclear force, and who came late or early to the war against drugs. Consultants and analysts liken the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> media to a jungle and the race there to tag-team wrestling. `` It's loud, it's raucous, it's no-holds-barred, it's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, love it or leave it,'' said analyst <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> may be the only city in the nation that still has two tabloid newspapers, each `` competing to have bigger headlines that say more outrageous things than the other.'' He also said the city's notorious self-centeredness, immortalized in a New Yorker magazine cover map that showed a huge <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> adjoining a tiny <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has helped shape the race. `` You did n't see <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> politicians dominating the coverage in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said. `` But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it's a Koch vs. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> contest because New Yorkers are most interested in other New Yorkers.'' The tumultuous <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> media coverage may actually raise the level of voter awareness, some consultants said, although voters may not be seeing and hearing exactly what the candidates want them to. `` The more people you have talking about politics, the greater the odds are that the average voter will at least hear something or read something that's of use in making a decision,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political media expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. The candidates are paying a lot of money in their attempts to break through the cacophony with their own carefully honed themes. Industry sources say it costs from $ 10,000 to upwards of $ 30,000 to buy 30 seconds of prime time advertising on a local <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> television station, depending on the popularity of the program. That compares to an average of $ 500 _ maybe $ 1,000 during a blockbuster show _ for 30 seconds in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who hopes to spend $ 1 million on media, borrowed $ 100,000 last week last week to try to meet that goal. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budgeted $ 500,000 _ $ 300,000 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, $ 100,000 upstate and $ 100,000 on Spanish-language ads. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign estimated it would spend between $ 500,000 and $ 1.5 million, depending on what the others forked out. The frenzied atmosphere `` makes it more difficult, certainly, to get through,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>. `` But we feel our message is very strong and clear and punches through the clutter straight to the voters.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was continuing through the weekend with a biographical spot, an anti-drug ad, a spot stressing his responsibilities as a chief executive and another in which he speaks Spanish. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was running five ads, among them an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmer's endorsement, an anti-drug spot by filmmaker <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, an ad showing him confronting Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and a commercial in Spanish <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the future of his candidacy on the line, was making the most effort outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was running four ads statewide, in addition to a new <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION> endorsement in the city. In the ad, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, standing on the porch of <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> understands the needs of cities and has fought for the homeless and against drugs. `` And in the critical area of foreign policy, where there is no margin for error, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is head and shoulders above the rest,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> brought in veteran media strategist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> to orchestrate his last-ditch effort. But another veteran, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s move came too late to do any good and criticized the other candidates for a similar lack of foresight. `` One has to come in ahead of time, raise proper money and spend it wisely. They did n't do any of those things. None of them. And their stuff is equally bad,'' said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, who has worked for <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, among others. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> touched a nerve during <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s 1964 campaign with a famous ad against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. The spot showed a little girl frolicking in a field of daisies _ and ended with a mushroom cloud. This time around, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> contended, the presidential candidates have failed to connect emotionally with voters in their living rooms _ including himself. `` I wear a button,'' he said. `` It says: ` Do n't vote, you'll only encourage them.'

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should consider halting the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> program to upgrade the problem-plagued B-1B bomber because the new plane will be obsolete, a key congressman said in a speech released Sunday. `` We should consider now whether it's worth spending any more money to make the B-1B operable but obsolescent,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement, disputed <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s contentions and noted that he has long opposed the bomber. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s comments were contained in a speech, released Sunday, which he plans to give Monday on the floor of the House. It is the latest in a series of addresses in which <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> is outlining the results of a lengthy investigation by his committee into new atomic weapons begun during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. The B-1 was killed by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> resurrected it six years ago, saying the nation needed to buy 100 of the swing-wing planes to replace the aging B-52s as the atomic bombers in the nation's nuclear arsenal. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also gave the go-ahead for development of the radar-evading `` stealth'' bomber. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized 100 of the B-1Bs for a total cost of $ 20.5 billion, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> now says it will cost up to $ 3 billion more to fix `` electronic counter-measures -LRB- ECM -RRB-'' that will permit the B-1B to evade Soviet air defenses. It will be at least 1991 before the B-1B has the <ORGANIZATION> ECM </ORGANIZATION> capabilities it was supposed to have in 1986, according to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. `` My concern is that the B-1B will never work as advertised because of the time it's taking to fix the problem _ time during which Soviet air defenses are improving,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` The bomber's electronic counter-measures will be fixed at great cost only to meet more effective defenses. Or, at best, it will be rendered redundant by the B-2 -LRB- stealth -RRB-. Either way, we will have spent billions for something we did n't need.'' In a response, Gen. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, said, `` <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s opposition to the B-1B predates the first assembly of the first aircraft and should be considered in that context.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots have repeatedly praised the plane and he said it is a major addition to the nation's nuclear arsenal. Like the B-52, said <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, the B-1B should `` contribute to deterrence for 30 years or more.'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> admitted that `` we are behind the original schedule for developing the <ORGANIZATION> ECM </ORGANIZATION>.'' But he added that `` ECM is by its nature, a constant contest as we improve penetration capability and the soviets improve air defenses.''

 A murder trial that had spectators lining up an hour early to get seats ended with a recommended death sentence for a man charged with killing seven relatives, but residents still do n't understand why the crimes were committed. `` I'm happy it's all over, so we can start forgetting,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON>, an elderly neighbor of some of the victims. `` I think we can go on with our lives now,'' said <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON> after watching jurors find <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> guilty of first-degree murder in connection with a shooting spree that killed Mrs. <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON>'s oldest daughter, her four grandsons and two others. The jurors also recommended the judge sentence Schnick to death. No sentencing date was set. Schnick, a dairy farmer, was tried for the deaths of his wife, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, and two nephews, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, 2. Also killed were <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>; <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s wife and Mrs. <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON>; and the <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s two other sons, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON>, 6. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> were brother and sister. The prosecutor reserved those four cases for possible later trial had he not gained convictions in this trial. The victims died in a shooting spree Sept. 25 at two dairy farms near <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION>, a community of about 200 people 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Marshfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said he could not bring himself to go to the trial. But he stayed near his radio, waiting to hear the verdict, handed down Thursday, and sentence, recommended Friday. `` I leave the house every day and see it -LRB- <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> house -RRB- right there. It's on my mind every day because I'm right in the middle of it,'' <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said Friday. The jurors took 2 -LCB- hours to decide on a death sentence for Schnick, the only alternative to life in prison without possibility of parole in a case of first-degree murder. `` I do n't want him to be put to death, I just want him -LRB- on death row -RRB- where he ca n't get out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON> said. `` The ones with life sentences can get out on the grounds, they can interact with each other. They have rights, and I do n't think he deserves rights. He did n't give them any rights.'' Initially, based on statements given by <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>, authorities blamed <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> for the shooting spree. But <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> confessed Oct. 5. Mrs. <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON> and her neighbors crowded into the courtroom for the week-long trial to sit for eight or nine hours each day. `` <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> -LRB- Schnick -RRB- was a friend of mine,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>. `` I just wanted to see it happen. There's so much small-town gossip that people wanted to see how much was true.'' Spectators arrived at least an hour before testimony was to begin, time enough to be searched by security officers and to be sure of getting one of the 100 or so seats on hard benches. `` We come early and stay all day,'' said <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION>, who accompanied Mrs. <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON>. `` We take turns going to lunch and the restroom, so we do n't lose our seats.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> explained the large turnout. `` They're here for the same reason I am _ to find out what happened and to see justice done,'' she said. `` I just wanted to know why he did it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Beisiegel </PERSON> said. But she said the trial brought her no closer to understanding why <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>, described as a dependable neighbor and loving father, turned on his family. Prosecutors speculated that <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> killed his wife in order to collect her life insurance, which totaled $ 100,000. County prosecutor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> also said Mrs. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> was aware that her husband had a mistress and may have enlisted the support of her brother and his family when she asked <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> for a divorce, igniting his anger against them all. The defense countered that <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> told officers <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> had molested his sister when the two were young, and threatened <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> when Mrs. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> pressured him to seek psychiatric care. Attorneys hinted that such family tension could have led <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> to commit the murders, as <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> originally claimed.

 Patriot's Day, which commemorates the start of the Revolutionary War in these parts, has become an occasion of much spectacle, including the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> and a re-enactment of a much earlier race: <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>'s ride. The living <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>, great-great-great-grandson of the silversmith, has a different plan for Monday's state holiday: `` Goof off.'' The man wearing tricorn, cloak and riding boots and riding the horse will be 72-year-old <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, a brigadier general in the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancers </ORGANIZATION>. The ceremonial militia founded in 1836 has been re-enacting the ride <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> took from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> the night of April 18, 1775, for decades, more or less factually. This year, Patriot's Day was stretched to cover the weekend with parades, dances and restaged battles, including the one at <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> where the shot heard round the world was fired. Others have retraced the historic 13-mile route <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> made famous 213 years ago. Two years ago <PERSON> Ashrita </PERSON> <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, a world-class hand-clapper and underwater pogo-stick hopper, set a world record by somersaulting all the way. It's an occasion the real <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> prefers to sit out. `` Number one. I do n't ride horses,'' he said. In his late 50s and living in a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town he prefers to keep secret, this <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> does appreciate his heritage, however. He was a featured guest on `` To Tell the Truth,'' the 1960s TV game show. He shared a laugh with <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Standish </PERSON>, a descendant of the Mayflower colonist. And he has learned how to brush off pesky questions about where he keeps his horse. `` Probably the most fascinating thing is when you meet people for the first time and they jump back almost, as if people in history might not have relatives,'' said <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>. He is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the 1680 house in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> where his ancestor lived. <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> said he planned to `` goof off'' on Patriot's Day, taking a break from his job as marketing chief at <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, an industrial metals company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. He wo n't even be present for the re-enacted ride, which is n't entirely faithful to historic fact The original <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> set out the night of April 18 to warn <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and others in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> that British soldiers were assembling on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Common. Gen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>, commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colony </ORGANIZATION>, had ordered a detachment of 700 men to go to <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> and destroy supplies and arrest <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> left his house at 10 p.m. He took a boat across the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>, borrowed a horse and trotted into <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> at midnight. After alerting <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, he was joined by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> and all three headed for <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. On the way they were snared by British troops. Only <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> escaped to complete the ride. The 20th century re-enactment goes only as far as <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, following the same time schedule except for swapping night time for day so the public can watch. And in this version <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON>, played by Lancer Lt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, leaves from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section with the same 10 a.m. start-off as <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> and the two wind up in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> for the finale. The real Revere just knocked on doors. Snow will shout, `` The British are coming!''

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s assassinated army chief called for a military escalation in the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in his last interview, published Sunday. Answering questions in the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> was quoted as saying the four-month-old confrontation in the Israeli-occupied territories was moving into a second stage involving increased use of military force. Seven masked commandos burst into the <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>'s home in suburban <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, early Saturday and opened fire with submachine guns, killing him, two bodyguards and a gardener. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>, 52, also called <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was the most senior <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official assassinated since <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla group in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, was founded in 1964. He was <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s closest aide, led the group's main army, and supervised military operations inside the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> News reports have linked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to the killings, but the -RCB- nment has refused to comment on them. In Sunday's interview, <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> said the next stage of the uprising `` involves commando operations against select Israeli military targets.'' `` These operations will shore up the morale of our people in the occupied territories, because such operations will be directed against those who act as tools of extremely brutal oppression, beatings and bone-breakings,'' he said. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination unleashed a new spate of rioting in the occupied territories, causing more than a dozen deaths. In the interview, <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> said new operations would include building up the uprising's own military organization and distribution of such weapons as Molotov bombs, flame and lead balls, and arrows. He also talked of stepped-up use of guerrilla raids outside the occupied territories. Israeli experts say <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> was responsible for a list of bloody attacks, such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijacking in which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded. In the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> so far have fought the heavily armed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security forces mainly with stones. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials were reported to order them to avoid guns to help gain international sympathy. In his interview, <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising `` will continue until the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag is hoisted in the heart of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as the capital of the independent Palestinian state.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers <LOCATION> Jersualem </LOCATION> its capital.

 North met South, stereotypes melted and horizons expanded this weekend as 13 teen-age girls from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> arrived to sample the culture and delights of the big city. `` I did n't think they were going to be so modern,'' said <PERSON> Kina </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a ninth grader at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` We thought they were going to have straw hats, overalls and wear no makeup ... but they were pretty much like us.'' The <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, girls met with a group of inner-city minority girls from the METRO Achievement Program during a weekend trip sponsored by Greenville-based <ORGANIZATION> Daisy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the services of minority youth and elderly. `` If I could bring one thing from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, it would be the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, because it's big,'' <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 17, said Sunday, after a look at the world's tallest building. Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said she would love to return, `` as long as I know I can go back home to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. I'm used to a small town and slower pace.'' The girls talked about shopping and exchanged addresses so they could keep the North-South exchange going after the visit by becoming pen pals. `` I like corresponding with people in different places,'' said <PERSON> Narsauinika </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprouse </PERSON>, a 15-year-old from <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot you can put in a letter you might not want to say in person.'' <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Seja </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said meeting the Mississippians and corresponding with them would help her `` get a feel of life outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' `` We're so much in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that we want to know what life is like in the outside world,'' she said. Packed into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> girls' short visit was a trip to the <ORGANIZATION> DuSable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, a performance by the <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> American Dance Theater, and a sightseeing tour of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I got to see a lot of things about culture that I did n't even know about, and the <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> dancers were incredible,'' said <PERSON> Chandrika </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, 16, after attending a Saturday night performance by the New York-based group. The DuSable museum especially impressed visitor <PERSON> Lorarine </PERSON> <PERSON> Loving </PERSON>, 15. `` I like the in-depthness of the history there,'' she said. `` There is not enough taught in the schools, and it was just there waiting for you to come and see it. `` I learned that a lot of things were invented by the black man, but because they did n't have the power to get a patent, the white man had a patent on it.'' Although some of the girls were excited about the cultural exposure, several said the airplane flight and a promised trip to a shopping mall were the highlights. `` To come to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, of course, is new, exciting and different. Because our town is so small, we do n't have museums and cultural things,'' said <PERSON> Kenya </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a 15-year-old from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said she most looked forward to `` meeting people, going to the museum and going to the mall.'' The ninth grader said she especially hoped to pick up some <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears T-shirts. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Womback </PERSON>, 14, said she had been to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> three times previously to visit relatives. `` There's a big difference'' between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, which has about 39,000 residents, she said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> `` is a big city with lots of people to meet and places to go.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, chairman of the board of the <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> group, said she hatched the idea while visiting the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> city. `` I thought the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> youngsters should be exposed to culture outside their own environment, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ with all the performing arts here _ is an ideal place,'' she said.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> convenes for its annual session Monday facing $ 900 million in proposed state budget cuts from a governor who has been in office barely a month. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> outlined a bare-bones $ 5 billion budget last week that calls for a 36-hour work week, down from a 40-hour week to accomplish a 10 percent pay cut for most state employees, and sharp reductions in state aid to local governments. Teachers, however, would get a 5 percent raise under the plan. `` We've had to do 16 years worth of work in five months to clean up the biggest fiscal mess in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> history,'' the governor, who has been working with a transition team since shortly after his election in November, told the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the Budget. According to administration figures, the state faces an accumulated deficit of $ 1.2 billion going back to 1982 when the oil boom ended, and a $ 210 million cash shortage for the remainder of the fiscal year ending in June. As promised, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> presented a budget plan based upon current revenue projections and minus tax increases. `` In order to balance the budget, we have had to make some hard, hard, hard decisions,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, in our state, that is long overdue.'' In order to produce a balanced spending plan based on current revenues, about $ 900 million will have to be cut from the $ 5.9 billion budget adopted last year, said Commissioner of Administration <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>. Using emergency powers granted during a special lawmaking session shortly after <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> took office on March 15, the administration has cut spending and seized agency surpluses to provide more than $ 30 million for the general fund. Scores of emergency fee increases for state services also are on tap. The state is planning to sell up to $ 250 million in short-term notes to provide enough cash through June 30 and has launched a plan to sell long-term bonds to pay off the $ 1.2 billion debt. To provide more cash against a projected cash shortage, the administration is delaying one state payday until the next fiscal year, holding off on state contributions to government retirement systems and putting off state income tax refunds until August. During the regular session, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> also plans to present his plans to overhaul public education, the state's system of colleges and universities, put stringent limitations on campaign contributions and beef up environmental protection. A special legislative session, tentatively set for July after the regular 85-day meeting ends, will deal with overhauling the state's tax structure, administration officials said. Lawmakers will not receive a complete budget proposal for at least another week. The new budget will determine priorities for the coming years as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> faces the prospect of a no-growth economy, <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> acknowledged that local governments would be left with funding problems if state revenue sharing payments are eliminated, but said that the state must change its priorities now that oil revenues have dried up.

<TEXT>
 More than 5,000 Poles paid homage to the heroes of the Jewish Ghetto Uprising at an unsanctioned rally Sunday, then retraced the route of condemned Jews to the deportation site for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps. In a tribute under bright sunlight in front of the Monument to the Heroes of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto, the 1943 uprising's last commander in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, and leaders of the banned trade union Solidarity spoke of the tragedy of the Holocaust. `` We bend our heads in homage to the courage and dignity -LRB- of the fighters -RRB-, and at the same time to all those who were dying of starvation, from bullets, in flames. To all victims,'' said Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, reading a letter to the crowd from union chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Authorities had told the citizens' committee organizing the ceremony that it would be illegal. But police did not interfere either during the speeches and wreath-laying at the monument or as the banner-carrying throng made its way to the old deportation site at <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION>, about a half-mile away. Earlier, thousands of people, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor leader <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, packed the city's Jewish cemetery to honor two Jewish socialists executed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1943. Across town in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, the <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> honored more than 100 Poles for their efforts to rescue Jews during World War II. The ceremonies were part of unofficial observances sponsored by Polish intellectuals and opposition activists to mark the 45th anniversary of the uprising. More than 4,500 people from around the world have come to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the weeklong observances. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> dedicated a monument to executed socialist Jewish Bund leaders <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Alter </PERSON>, who were ordered put to death by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1943. `` It's better now than never and so I'm happy, but I am also bitter that it's taking place only now,'' said <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Iza </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who traveled to the ceremony with her sons <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> The ceremony brought together a cross-section of the Polish opposition movement and linked it historically to the political activism of earlier generations. Represented were Solidarity, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the conservative opposition group <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poland </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, 64, had been a leader of the Bund party's youth movement. He led a unit of Bund fighters in the uprising, in which several hundred Jewish insurgents staged a three-week struggle against the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto in April 1943. News of the execution of <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON> and Alter in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached the outside world a few months before the uprising. They had been deported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> occupied eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in September 1939, a few weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had invaded from the West. At the time, the Soviets and <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had entered into their non-aggression pact that led to the division of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> between them. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said the two men, members of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> municipal council, were executed for signing an official protest against the Soviet occupation. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said he was representing <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. He drew repeated applause when he likened the Bundist leaders' struggle to that of Solidarity, which was declared illegal after the government's martial law crackdown in 1981 At <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> and officials of the Polish veterans' association were present as 96 medals and certificates were presented to more than 100 Poles for rescuing Jews during World War II. The silver medal for `` Righteous Among Nations in the World'' bears an inscription from the Talmud in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> and French: `` He who saves one life also saves the world.'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Zandman </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> had an emotional reunion with the children of three Polish sisters whose family hid him in a hole with four other Jews for 18 months in 1943-44. Gen. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminski </PERSON>, a leader of the Polish veterans' association <ORGANIZATION> Zbowid </ORGANIZATION>, told the assembly that more than 3 million Polish Jews were killed, and he praised those Poles who came to the aid of their Jewish countrymen

<HEAD>Study Urges States To Help Fight Money Laundering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Instead of relying on the federal government, state and local authorities should vigorously pursue money laundering cases against drug traffickers who frequently dump their illegal profits back into local communities, according to a new study issued Sunday. Only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> have laws specifically barring conversion of profits from drugs and other crimes, said the report, but most states do have effective though rarely utilized laws which can be used to prosecute money laundering operations. They include statutes against criminal conspiracy, fraud and failure to pay state income taxes, said the report conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> by the Police Executive Research Forum, a group of police officials. The report notes that money generated by narcotics trafficking and other underworld activities has been estimated as high as $ 100 billion annually. State and local law enforcement agencies rely on the federal government to investigate complex money laundering cases because such operations often are international in scope. But offenders at the lower levels of criminal groups are capable of generating enormous sums that require laundering, `` and for the same reasons that international traffickers and syndicate racketeers need such services,'' concluded the report by the police forum's associate director, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Karchmer </PERSON>. Money launderers convert cash from illegal activities to a form that conceals its origin and true ownership. <PERSON> Karchmer </PERSON> said that illegal money which is `` generated locally tends to remain locally, often in a variety of financial institutions and legitimate business ventures, and as investment capital ready for more illegal activities.'' Because state and local agencies `` are often closer to street and wholesale-level drug dealing, they may be able to amass more information on the flow of illegal money than we had earlier thought,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NIJ </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency.

 Seven Sikh separatists accused of some of the worst attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state this year were trapped in a farmhouse and killed during a six-hour shootout with government troops, officials said Sunday. Three members of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, including a head constable, were killed in the gunbattle Saturday night near <LOCATION> Ratha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gudha </LOCATION>, about 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The seven-man Sikh band, led by 18-year-old <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was responsible for killing 55 people in the past three months, said <ORGANIZATION> S.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virk </ORGANIZATION>, a deputy inspector general of the paramilitary police force. He said their victims included 25 people, including a 6-month-old baby and an 80-year-old woman, killed March 31 in three villages north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> said a patrol going from house to house suspected Sikh gunmen were holed up in the farmhouse and ordered them to surrender. But the Sikhs opened fire with automatic rifles and hurled hand grenades, <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> said. He said the seven-man patrol returned the fire and was reinforced by about 150 men who rushed to the scene and encircled the farmhouse. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> police superintendent <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> as saying the government troops poured at least 1,200 rounds of ammunition into the farmhouse and it caught fire. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> said a large cache of weapons and ammunition, including Chinese-made semi-automatic rifles, was recovered from the farmhouse. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> said the band's leader, also known as <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulha </PERSON>, escaped from jail two years ago after being arrested in the deaths of two Hindus. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> later joined the <ORGANIZATION> Kalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest of a dozen underground Sikh separatist groups. Eight people, including four Sikh militants, died in other violence Saturday and Sunday in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Indian authorities have blamed Sikh separatists for 741 killings in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year. Sikhs, whose 500-year-old faith has roots in both <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who make up 82 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people. Sikhs are only 2 percent of the national population, but they are the majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. The most militant Sikh groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Kalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, want to establish an independent Sikh nation that would be called <LOCATION> Kalistan </LOCATION>. More moderate groups say they would settle for greater autonomy in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported that police killed four Sikh militants Saturday night and early Sunday in the <LOCATION> Bhatinda </LOCATION> district 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Sikh militants killed a Sikh liquor vendor and two other people in three separate attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Saturday night, the news agency said. Some Sikh separatists want to ban liquor and periodically kill people who sell it. In <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, a police constable died Sunday of wounds suffered Thursday during a robbery, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Another constable was killed when Sikh gunmen stole about $ 23,000 from a van, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are warning Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> that he could face a black voter backlash two years from now, because his decision to suspend his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bid is seen as hurting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. By suspending his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign rather than quitting outright, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> still stands to pick up 47 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegates who are to be chosen next month by state party leaders. Those delegates would otherwise have gone to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Now <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters are making it clear they do n't think <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is playing fair, and hinting he could face the consequences if he seeks <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election in 1990. `` Out is out. We want him out,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brookins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign chairman, in urging <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to quit the presidential race. <PERSON> Brookins </PERSON> joined other black leaders, including Chicag Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, in urging <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to formally end his campaign. Illinois Republicans are already hinting that they see <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s liberal presidential platform as grist for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign against him `` He's always been very successful in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in hiding the fact that he's an old-fashioned 1950s liberal,'' said Republican Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` That may have a more important bearing on the campaign for the senatorship in 1990 than the fact that he missed some roll calls while he was out running for president,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Some observers say attacks on two fronts _ from black Democrats and Republicans _ could hurt <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s prospects for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election. `` It depends on who runs against him, how he runs and what he does between now and then,'' said pollster <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>. `` It also depends on the mood of the state _ has it become slightly more liberal, more conservative?'' Others predict the delegate controversy will be old news by then. `` In this business, two years is a lifetime,'' added <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> political strategist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Demuzio </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> supporter, pointedly compared <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s delegation to the favorite-son unit taken to the 1984 Democratic convention by the late <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. <PERSON> Demuzio </PERSON> said of the delegate flap: `` It'll blow over.'' With <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on vacation last week, his aides moved to quiet the grumbling among Illinois' black Democrats. The senator's press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s move to keep a lock on the 47 delegates was intended to ensure a voice in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for his supporters, not to derail <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s candidacy. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defender </ORGANIZATION>, a black-oriented newspaper, <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> suggested that were <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to formally drop out of the race, many of his delegates might sign on with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, thus hurting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Many Democrats say <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s convincing win over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' March 15 presidential primary proves he's still popular. `` He went a long way in stopping the rumors and the perception that he was in trouble,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters point out the primary win was before <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s controversial move to suspend campaigning and keep his delegates. They say any perception that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is linked to a stop-Jackson movement could leave him without the support of many of the blacks who helped lift him to victory in 1984. `` They are raising this question with us, and we will have to answer that as we move into elections, his re-election,'' <PERSON> Brookins </PERSON> said. `` I think that in the primary election there will be other people running. There are many, many options.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s friends say attacks on him might actually strengthen his hand in a 1990 Senate race. `` For many of us, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> stands for a particular set of principles,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Netsch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a Simon delegate. `` I think people can be very proud, not so much of how far he got but that he never wavered on the kind of things he stands for.''

 The Woonasquatucket, Moshassuck and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> rivers, long buried beneath railroad yards, a post office and the world's widest bridge, are being exhumed in a $ 40 million waterfront renewal that planners hope will give the entire city a lift. The reshaping that began last week will propel <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> into the 21st century by reviving many features of the 19th, city officials say. `` We're building on our dreams of the past,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The mayor hopes to erase <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>'s longtime image as a center of organized crime and corruption. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>, the reputed longtime boss of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> mob, had his headquarters here until his death in 1984, and his son, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` Junior'' <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON> of suburban <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, is considered by lawmen to control his father's old organization. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cianci </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was forced from office in 1984 amid allegations he assaulted his wife's lover and that city employees were stealing municipal asphalt and curbstones. The <PERSON> Cianci </PERSON> administration began planning the redevelopment that <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> hopes will eradicate the negative perceptions of his city, but <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> said his administration has reshaped the project _ and city government _ substantially. `` People who have had indictments or convictions from the corruption days of the previous administration have been eliminated from city government,'' he said. `` I think I've been able to learn from the mistakes of other administrations and to guide us against it.'' The redevelopment has produced little opposition, mostly because the area to be developed was largely used only for parking lots. Some critics have accused the city of concentrating on glitzy downtown development at the expense of affordable housing in the neighborhoods, but <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> said development benefits the entire metropolis. `` To have a run-down, shabby downtown is a reflection on the rest of the city,'' he said. `` We need each other.'' If all goes according to plan, the Capital Center area separating downtown and the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, long given over to railroad yards and parking lots, will be bristling with office buildings and a $ 350 million shopping center within five years. The Woonasquatucket will flow through the center of the development, pausing at a small cove in a park, before joining the Moshassuck to form the <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in front of a tower that will house the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The rivers now join underneath the downtown post office, which is staying where it is while the rivers are moved 500 feet to the southeast. In the early 1800s, there was a cove on the <LOCATION> Woonasquatucket </LOCATION> right about where the city's plan calls for the new one. The cove grew smaller and smaller as the city expanded, finally vanishing underneath the Union Station rail yards. At the time they were buried, the rivers were not considered civic assets, said <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>. `` They were treated as open sewers, frankly,'' <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said. Chip Young, spokesman for the environmental group Save the Bay, said the rivers have become somewhat cleaner. `` It's good to see them doing this,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said at groundbreaking ceremonies for the river relocation project. `` Now, the challenge will be to keep them clean.'' Union Station, a 90-year-old landmark that was gutted by fire two years ago, is getting a new copper roof and should reopen as an office complex in about a year, developer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsella </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> vacated Union Station two years ago and moved to a facility closer to the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, clearing the way for developers to remove the old rail yards and open the area to development. The Westminster Street pedestrian mall, a relic of the 1960s when planners thought they could save downtown shopping districts by closing a street to traffic, will be reopened to cars and trucks this fall, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, director of the city Department of Planning and Development. The downtown pedestrian mall was unable to compete with suburban shopping centers. The neighborhood, just west of downtown skyscrapers, was predominantly residential until the middle of the 19th century, but <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> is skeptical about <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON>'s dream of reviving it as a place for people to live. City officials concede they will have to do some selling to attract people to live in the city center, but said they think there is an audience willing to listen.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION> prefer <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> to rock, says a researcher who found that music made the friendly mammals even friendlier. `` They seem to have a preference for <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>, and -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierre </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Rampal </PERSON> on flute. They'll jump out of the water for that,'' professional diver and photographer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` They also thought ` Physical' -LRB- by <LOCATION> Olivia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newton-John </LOCATION> -RRB- was pretty neat. But, when we put on some old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and some other rock' n' roll, they boogied on out ... They just split,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` I guess they did n't think it was too cool.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> made his discovery recently when he played a concerto by <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> with his boat's hydrophone lowered 30 feet into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bahama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Soon, nine wild dolphins were circling. Intrigued, he then played a tape made from dolphins that live at <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. When the tamed dolphins whistled and trilled, their wild cousins swam to <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and let him tickle and scratch their bellies. `` It was like they understood what the other dolphins were saying,'' he recalls. `` It gave you goose bumps.'' An Ocean World crew is now researching if the dolphins were responding `` language'' on the tapes <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> played for them. The team has made tapes of tame dolphins as they performed such tricks as swimming through hoops. They plan to play the tapes and then toss objects needed to perform the tricks into the water. If the wild dolphins perform, it could be a sign that they understood the tapes and that dolphins have a language _ a controversial notion. And University of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> dolphin researcher <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON> says that even if the wild dolphins should perform on cue, it could be because of coincidence and not language. `` You've got no way of knowing,'' she said.

 A museum and library filled with old photographs and the now-rusted guns of the men who stormed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s Bay of Pigs was dedicated Sunday on the 27th anniversary of the failed invasion. `` Future generations must know what happened at the Bay of Pigs. They must know we fought and many died,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, president of those who served in Brigade 2506. Many of the 400 who walked through the hall and central room were Brigade veterans who pointed to photographs of people they had known before their friends died in battle. `` We knew we could have lost out lives, but we did n't believe we would lose the battle,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON>, who was captured and held 22 months after the April 17, 1961 landing. The museum, nestled in the heart of the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> section in central <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, contains bitter memories for many of the people who live nearby. It recalls the day when President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> canceled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of the CIA-backed mission and left the exiled <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> volunteers stranded on the beach of the Cuban bay. `` It was a betrayal _ a fiasco,'' said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, 47, a paratrooper in the invasion who now is director of the museum. `` But those men should not be forgotten. They were fighting for American principles of democracy and freedom.'' The idea for the museum was hatched two years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pigs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as a way of gaining recognition for the 114 men who died in the invasion and the 1,189 held in Cuban prisons for 22 months until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought their freedom with $ 53 million in food and medicine. `` To this day, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has not recognized the Bay of Pigs veterans as true American veterans,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said. `` Maybe people will come in here and see the sacrifices we made fighting for the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' About 300 of the volunteers joined the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces after their release. A single-story house is home to the museum and library, which is funded by the veterans and $ 150,000 in grants from the state and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Walls are lined with photographs tracing how most of the 1,400 Cuban exiles were quietly recruited from the streets of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to secret training bases in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Other photos depict how the prisoners of the battle were paraded and mocked at show trials in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A photocopy of a purported top-secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> document is also on display, detailing plans made during the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> administration to attack the marshy beach. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> says the document was donated to the museum anonymously, although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government steadfastly denies the document ever existed. One section of the museum displays guns and ammunition used to battle <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s troops for 65 hours, until supplies gave out. Hanging high on a wall of the museum is the green flag of Brigade 2506, the standard for the ransomed Bay of Pigs veterans. President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> raised the flag in a 1963 Orange Bowl ceremony welcoming the prisoners home, promising `` this flag will be returned to this brigade in a free <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> acknowledges the museum is full of broken promises and bad memories, but he stresses it was not meant to denigrate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Just because we question the thought that went into planning the Bay of Pigs invasion does n't mean we do n't love the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said. `` That's freedom. That's exactly what we were fighting for.''

 A year after she lost an arm in a shark attack, April <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Volgino </PERSON> has been named editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Llano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> yearbook, plays xylophone in the band and has kept drawing, hoping one day to become an artist. April, 17, and her parents say their lives, turned upside down by the incident off <LOCATION> Mustang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> last April 18, are calmer now. `` My friends get upset over itty-bitty problems they have,'' April said. `` Nothing upsets me anymore.'' April was attacked by a shark in chest-deep water, 100 feet from the shore. Her father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, attempted to beat the shark away with his fists, and wrestled with it for about 20 seconds when it pursued as they fled. April lost her right arm about six inches below the shoulder, but that has n't slowed her down much. `` Drawing was no problem,'' April said. `` I'm even better than I was before.'' `` Before, I wanted to pursue an art career, but did n't do a lot about it. Then I almost died. I put a lot more into it now.'' The <PERSON> Voglinos </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caller-Times </ORGANIZATION> that several hospitals tried to recruit April as a patient because of the attention she received in the press. April hates being labeled a `` shark victim.'' `` People ask me if I'm the one,'' she said. `` I think I'm going to have a T-shirt made with ` The One' written across it.'' She also does n't like to talk about the incident. `` Many people do n't believe in that type of coping,'' she said, `` but they're not me and I have to live with it. If I change my mind in the future, then I'll deal with it another way.'' April and her family often use humor to deal with the pain. `` The media account of what <PERSON> Dad </PERSON> did made him look like <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or something,'' April said. `` They made it seem very heroic.'' On the beach, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> collapsed from exhaustion and her mother, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>, administered first aid. `` When we got to the shore, I told Dad, ` I ca n't breathe,''' April said. Her father's answer after the panicked dash: `` Neither can I.'' April's physical progress has been slowed by painful bone spurs, which she says have hindered her ability to use her prosthesis. She will undergo surgery to remove the spurs this summer.

<HEAD>GOP Senator Says Plant-Closing Provision Kills Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the inclusion of a labor-backed, plant-closing provision in a new trade bill kills the measure. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has threatened to veto the trade bill if the plant shutdown notification remains intact, and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not accept any version of the bill that contains provisions that are `` injurious to a dynamic economy.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., in an appearance on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' said the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders last Thursday to include the provision marks the end of the trade `` I think that the result of last Thursday was to kill the bill, unless there is some other way of dusting it off at some later point,'' said <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this present bill, with plant closing, I think is dead.'' The plant-closing clause would require businesses with at least 100 employees to give 60 days notice of factory shutdowns and layoffs. Business groups oppose it, contending the requirement infringes on the prerogatives of company managers. Legislators are attempting to iron out differences between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the 1,000-page trade legislation. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will reconsider his position on the measure and sign the bill `` I'm sorry to see us come to a failure if we ca n't get this bill passed,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said on the CBS program. `` I'm optimistic, though, I think the bill will pass and the president will sign it. The congressman also said he remains hopeful that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can override a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto of the trade bill.

 Israeli soldiers Sunday turned back a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convoy carrying food and other supplies to this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> camp, where refugees under a 32-day-old curfew complained of severe shortages. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier guarding the Jelazoun camp told <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials their convoy posed a security threat. `` We have orders,'' he told them after making them wait an hour and a half. `` You could cause a disturbance. Maybe come another day.'' <PERSON> Jelazoun </PERSON>, home to about 5,000 refugees on a hillside 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, has been under the longest continuous curfew on a camp since the Palestinian uprising began in early December, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say. The Israeli army says it is one of the most violent spots in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The army uses curfews here and elsewhere in the occupied territories, held since the 1967 Middle East War, in an attempt to blunt the protests against its military rule. During a curfew, residents are confined to their homes and can circulate only with special permission from the army. Inside the camp Sunday, heaps of refuse were decaying beside many homes. Open sewers along the streets added to the stench. Residents remained mostly inside their shuttered homes, but occasionally one ventured outside to talk to visitors. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials had arrived there with three trucks filled with packages for each of the 900 families in the camp. The supplies included lentils, rice, cooking oil, sardines, corned beef, powdered milk and 4,000 loaves of bread. `` The situation is deteriorating every day,'' <PERSON> Mogens </PERSON> <PERSON> Fokdal </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief official responsible for the camp, said Sunday. `` People have gone without electricity for a month. They have no oil or fuel to cook. They are starting to burn old shoes and furniture to make fires.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, an official with the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said he had received assurances from a senior army liaison officer that he would be able to make the delivery. `` We just want to give people the food they need,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. He said previous shipments of bread had been allowed into the camp. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military administration said there was no policy of blocking <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> food deliveries to refugee camps. However, they must be cleared with the army in advance, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafovitch </PERSON>. `` In today's case, that was not done,'' he said. `` Life has become terrible this past month,'' said a 30-year-old refugee, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. `` We have no vegetables, no eggs, no meat. All we eat is bread and food from supplies we had before March 16.'' <PERSON> Fokdal </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> garbage trucks had been denied permission to enter the camp and clear away garbage since the curfew was imposed March 16. `` We suggested to the people that they burn the garbage themselves, to avoid disease,'' <PERSON> Fokdal </PERSON> said. `` But they fear the soldiers will see the fires as a demonstration.'' An army spokeswoman, who declined to give her name under military rules, said <PERSON> Jelazoun </PERSON> was placed under curfew because it was `` an especially problematic and violent camp.'' An army officer, who also would not give his name, said residents were being punished for tossing stones and firebombs at Israeli cars on the road outside the camp. `` Not a single Israeli car could pass here without being attacked before the curfew,'' the soldier said. `` Is that fair? Of course life here is n't a picnic. But these people have to pay for their actions.'' Soldiers posted at the camp entrance, moreoever, denied residents were suffering shortages. They said the curfew was lifted for two hours each afternoon, enabling refugees to buy as much food as they wanted.

 Slain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> will be buried in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> because he wanted to be close to his homeland of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, his wife said Sunday. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was assassinated by a commando squad Saturday in his home outside <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON> called the killing a `` serious blow'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but said no one leader embodies `` all the revolution and all the people.'' The body will be taken to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on Monday after a religious ceremony in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Intisar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> said she preferred that her husband be buried in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, but that his last wishes were to be buried `` in a place close to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Ramla </LOCATION> in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1935. He was the highest ranking Palestinian leader to be killed since <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group, was formed in 1964. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> immediately blamed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents for the killing, which set off the most violent wave of unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories since the uprising began there in December. <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON> told reporters that the commando team of six men and one woman was divided into two units with one entering by the front door of the house and the other through the back. They killed two bodyguards, one on the ground floor and one in the basement, then climbed the stairs. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>, alerted by the noise, waited with gun in hand, <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON> said. The revolver was pulverized by machine-gun fire, the fingers on his hand were torn apart and his body riddled with about 60 bullets, the spokesman said. Tunisian authorities said a gardener, initially described as a bodyguard, also was killed. There have been no arrests, but <LOCATION> Tunisian </LOCATION> police have recovered three rented vehicles, a car and two minibuses, said to have been used by the attackers, according to a preliminary report of the investigation. Jordanian authorities have agreed to allow <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> to be buried on <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> territory, <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON>'s statement said. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> sent a telegram Sunday to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> expressing his `` deepest grief'' over the slaying, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which made no mention of burial plans. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio show, `` World This Weekend,'' <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON> said a successor to <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> would be chosen after the funeral. He rejected allegations that <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> was likely killed by other Arabs. `` It is one of the Israeli lies and the Israelis themselves know that,'' <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON> told his interviewer. `` We have only one enemy that can make this kind of operation. That's the Israeli government.'' Asked whether there would be a reprisal for the killing, <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON> replied: `` I can not say that. I will say that we will continue our resistance in the occupied territories until we achieve self-determination, until we achieve our independent state in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Settlement Attempt in Damage Suit for AIDS-Exposed
Brothers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered a family with three AIDS-exposed sons to try to reach an out-of-court settlement with the school board that barred the children from classes, the school board chairman said. Attorneys for <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> met Friday, but <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON> refused to reveal any results of the meeting. The suit, which was filed in June 1987 after the brothers were forbidden to attend school in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, seeks unspecified `` substantial monetary damages.'' The Ray boys, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, 8, were allowed to attend <ORGANIZATION> Arcadia </ORGANIZATION> elementary school only after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ordered the school board on Aug. 5, 1987, to accept them in regular classes. The family was forced to flee their town a week after school began when their house was burned by an arsonist and they received threatening telephone calls and bomb threats. The brothers, all hemophiliacs, are believed to have been exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome through contaminated blood products they take to control their hemophilia. Since their exile, the family has resettled here and the brothers attend <ORGANIZATION> Gocio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ordered attorneys from both sides to meet in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, but the meeting before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> was closed to the public. Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> apparently ordered the attorneys not to discuss what happened at the conference. `` Obviously we were in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on Friday and we can not comment at all on what transpired there,'' said <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraghty </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, the school board's insurance carrier. The board's insurance policy has a limit of $ 1 million. <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON> said he did n't think that a settlement of $ 1 million or less would have to be authorized by the school board. `` Personally, I feel like this system had the best interest of those children in mind all the time,'' he said. `` I do n't feel like we really owe them anything.'' Said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> family attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, `` We certainly would like to settle the case on a just and reasonable basis. It does n't benefit anyone to proceed.'' Since their house was burned, the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> family has received more than $ 100,000 in public donations, and in January <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> announced it would pay the Rays $ 100,000 for the rights to film their story.

<HEAD>Mao Statues Torn Down At Beijing University</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A huge statue of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> came toppling down under cover of darkness Sunday at the nation's most prestigious university in a move to further lessen the influence of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s late leader The four-story-tall monument in front of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s main library was one of the largest in the nation All that remains of it and a second smaller one just inside the campus' west gate are the pedestals and some rubble, an American student said. Larger-than-life statues of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, bare-headed, wearing a long wind-blown overcoat and with hand raised in greeting, once were fixtures in nearly all institutions and official compounds. However, no new statues have been erected in recent years and others have come down as the official Chinese attitude toward <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, one of the founders of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has changed from unquestioning allegiance to the position that he was a great man but made major mistakes. Late Saturday and early Sunday, workers were seen laboring on the larger statue under bright lights. It had been covered by scaffolding and plastic sheeting for more than a week, but students said it was being cleaned and repaired. At about 5 a.m., the mammoth concrete statue was sawed off at the feet and came toppling down, leaving a large dent on the pavement, the student said. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> has come under criticism from the current leadership of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> for the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the lightning-fast communization of agriculture that contributed to three years of famine. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has also blamed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> for the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, during which leftist radicals purged hundreds of thousands of people accused of disloyalty to the man Chinese used to call `` The Great Helmsman.'' It was during that decade, which ended with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s death, that the Maoist cult of personality reached a fevered peak. Chinese carried around `` The Little Red Book,'' containing hundreds of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s quotations, and posters of the leader were everywhere. Reaction to the destruction of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> University statues was mixed. A strongly worded poster criticizing their removal reportedly was put up briefly Sunday morning on a campus bulletin board, and several Chinese students expressed regret over the demolition of the figures. `` Taking it down was unecessary. He was an important historical figure, for good or for bad. We can judge for ourselves,'' one student said. However, several professors disagreed. `` It's a symbol of an era, and that era is over. Taking it down is only natural,'' said a middle-aged professor who helped erect the larger statue in 1967. There was no library then, and the statue was an imposing figure on an open square in the center of the campus, he said. `` Good,'' exclaimed another professor when he saw the wreckage of the bigger statue. He termed the monument `` a spiritual weight on the minds of the people.'' The professor, in his 30s, said it was the wish of the entire country that <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> statues be destroyed. He said the reason it was done secretly at night was that a crowd of people cheering its destruction would have gathered if the statue had been taken down during the day. The professors explained that to people who are old enough to remember the Cultural Revolution the Mao statues are painful reminders of that chaotic period. Neither the students nor the professors knew why the statues were destroyed, but some speculated that it may be part of a general beautification of the campus in preparation for <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 90th anniversary. The middle-aged professor said workers told him the pedestal in front of the library would be turned into a flower stand.

<HEAD>Iraqis Claim To Have Retaken Part Of Southern Faw Peninsula</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Sunday its troops backed by units of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> retook part of the southern <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in early 1986. Also, four injured crewmen from the missile frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, which hit a mine in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last week, were flown from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> to an American military hospital in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported seeing the bodies of thousands of Iranian troops on the battlefield and said that large numbers also were captured. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, denied the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claim, saying the attackers were driven back by Iranian Revolutionary Guards with hundreds of Iraqi casualties. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported `` heavy fighting'' in the Faw area Sunday evening and claimed Iraqi forces used internationally banned chemical weapons against the Iranian forces there. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired six missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and another into the southern city of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>, bringing the number fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to 132 since Feb. 29. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said the latest missile attacks killed nine civilians and damaged homes and shops. The attack Sunday marked the first time <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had taken the initiative in the ground war since mid-1986, when it overran the virtually abandoned Iranian town of <LOCATION> Mehran </LOCATION> just inside the Iranian border. The Iraqi agency issued a military communique saying troops had `` advanced in the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> sector to liberate our soil and trample upon anyone who dares to attack great <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' `` Pitched battles'' were under way in the marshy peninsula that juts out into the gulf and straddles <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only sea entrance, the agency said. Iraqi forces had taken the `` saline area,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said in an apparent reference to a 25-square-mile area about 15 miles from the town of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION>. It said coastal areas running parallel to the saline area also were `` completely liberated.'' A Western military analyst in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said the Iraqis had retaken a salt quarry and this paved the way for <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION>'s recapture. Another Western military analyst, who like the first spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Iranians once had about 50,000 men in the peninsula, but it was not known how many there were now. The Iraqis have fought a largely defensive war since being driven out of Iranian territory in 1982. They say they are willing to negotiate for peace and have blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intransigeance for the war's continuation. The use of the Presidential Guards in the attack suggested a major offensive, since they are rarely deployed in routine combat. In addition, the Iraqi agency later also reported that air force jet fighters provided support. The communique said the offensive was in retaliation for recent Iranian incursions into northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reportedly used chemical weapons in those attacks. The <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, was lost to the Iranian attackers in a major offensive in February 1986. Iranian troops carried out a nighttime amphibious landing, erecting a pontoon bridge. They eventually retained about 120 square miles of the peninsula, using their new positions to shell <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main air base near <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also reportedly used <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> to launch anti-ship, Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at Kuwaiti ships and oil facilities. The Iraqi agency said the `` missile shower'' was fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> early Sunday, and the rocket attack on Shiraz some time later. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not immediately acknowledge the attacks. The four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men were flown out from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> in mid-afternoon after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> honored them as `` brave men.'' They were the most seriously injured of the 10 hurt in the mine blast Thursday. The mine was believed laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The captain of the frigate, in his first phone call to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the ship struck the mine, said he was told to abandon ship twice. But Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said his crew of `` heroes'' saved a ship that was hit so hard her stern rose 15 feet in the air and flames shot 100 feet through her stacks. `` It was close, really close,'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> said. `` We took a very bad hit.'' <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>'s account of the Thursday incident was related Saturday by his wife, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> did not say who told him to abandon the ship, which pulled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> on Saturday.

 While first-year associates at the city's 20 largest law offices can expect to pull down about $ 71,000 a year, paychecks for the most senior associates vary by as much as 56 percent, according to a new survey. The study published in Monday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> found that 17 of the 20 firms pay first-year associates $ 70,000, $ 71,000 or $ 72,000. However, by the seventh year, base salaries vary from <ORGANIZATION> Cadwalader </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wickersham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>'s $ 108,000 to $ 169,000 at <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Cromwell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reycraft </PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION> Cadwalader </ORGANIZATION>, told the newspaper that associates normally get a bonus at his firm. `` You see similar salaries in the early years because the firms are all competing for the same scarce resource coming out of the top law schools,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, a Houston-based legal consultant. In its survey, the publication found average compensation for lawyers at the 20 firms are: $ 71,700, first year; $ 80,000, second year; $ 85,800, third year; $ 101,900, fourth year; $ 114,800, fifth year; $ 126,200, sixth year; and $ 139,000, seventh year.

 <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavarez </PERSON> brought the street smarts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to a battle Sunday with a Soviet foe. The contest between the 15-year-old <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> resident and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> teen-ager <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasavin </PERSON> last just 15 minutes. <PERSON> Krasavin </PERSON> took a last look at the chessboard and resigned, the victim of an unusual program to teach <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> students English through the ancient game. <PERSON> Tavarez </PERSON> and his schoolmates, however, have enjoyed only mixed success in their chess matches in the chess-worshiping <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, homeland of world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>. `` The first day they played, they were sort of destroyed,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, their English teacher and chess mentor. The 11 students from Junior High School No. 99 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, a crime - and drug-plagued area of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, came to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for two weeks to challenge counterparts at their favorite game The trip was masterminded by <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who teaches English through chess to 40 pupils from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and other countries. The students belong to his `` Royal Knights'' chess club. `` I saw that kids who were having difficulty learning were intrigued by chess,'' said 52-year-old Hall, who has been teaching for 23 years. `` The motivation was so great that they improved their English faster.'' `` Do they have an egghead-nerd image?'' Hall asked. `` The answer is no, with a capital ` N.' They play baseball, soccer, street hockey, and their drive to excel in chess carries over.'' The New Yorkers, clad in sneakers and blue jackets with their club's name, met their Soviet opponents Sunday at Pioneer Palace, a children's recreation center in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. In a third-floor classroom used to teach the game to budding grandmasters, the Americans sat down at brown wooden tables inlaid with chessboards to test themselves against some of the Soviet capital's best young players. Previous showings by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> April 10 and had played at the <LOCATION> Spartak </LOCATION> and Central Soviet chess clubs, ranged from disastrous to encouraging. `` The Russians know clever moves that we do n't, and that gives them control of the center of the board,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON>, 15, whose parents are from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tavarez </PERSON>, a club member of Puerto Rican origin who has played chess for only seven months, was one of the winners Sunday. `` He wants to take on the best,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` On the way over here, his question was, ` Does -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> play chess?''' However, <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pismenny </PERSON>, trainer for the Pioneers chess club, said the Americans had studied the game less than his players. The tour began to take shape last year, when the Royal Knights placed 17th in a national scholastic tournament. Two club members playing at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> met the women's champion, <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiburdanidze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, who suggested they visit her country. It took 11 months of planning and fund raising, as well as $ 20,000 in corporate sponsorship to make the idea a reality. The group was scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday for <LOCATION> Eshera </LOCATION>, a resort on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. They will spend three days there, travel to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to visit that northern Russian city and play more chess, then return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on April 24.

 The TV cameras were on and <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasche </PERSON> was getting up to work a math problem when his microphone cord snagged on a chair. `` It was no big deal but it took a second to get it unhooked,'' the high school sophomore and co-host of `` Homework Hotline'' said later. The live, phone-in television show is about as far from `` Wheel of Fortune'' as <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> is from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, but it's been a success at showcasing bright students and tutoring those with schoolwork troubles. Organizers from the public school system, a local vocational center and the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> scheduled an `` encore'' show Monday night on the cable channel where the hour-long `` Homework Hotline'' appeared five times this year as a pilot program. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruoff </PERSON>, principal of the <ORGANIZATION> Paducah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, says the show will probably be renewed for a second season. The television equipment is donated and volunteers include teachers, students and technical personnel to operate the equipment. `` What's the cost? Blood, sweat and tears,'' said <PERSON> Ruoff </PERSON>. `` One of the things we believed in is that _ in the short term at least _ if you need something bad enough you can find it in the budget.'' The show is broadcast Mondays at 7 p.m. and had 90 callers its first night. Two students answer the telephones and four others armed with encyclopedias and other reference works take turns answering the questions, sometimes using a blackboard. More than half the questions are in math.

<TEXT>
 A Moslem Afghan guerrilla group claimed Sunday that its fighters had captured a Communist army garrison in <LOCATION> eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, killing 20 enemy soldiers and capturing 50 others. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezbi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, said in a statement that the <LOCATION> Darwazgai </LOCATION> garrison at <ORGANIZATION> Shinki </ORGANIZATION> district in the <LOCATION> Zabul </LOCATION> province fell Saturday after several days of fighting. It quoted `` a wireless report'' from guerrillas in the area. It said 10 guerrillas had died and 18 others were wounded. Several mortars, guns, pistols, anti-aircraft guns, wireless sets and uniforms also were seized in the operation, the report said. The report of the capture comes only days after the signing in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> of a U.N.-mediated Soviet troop withdrawal accord. The guerrillas, who were not party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, have said they will not be bound by any accord in which they did not participate. They have vowed to continue the fight until the Communist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is toppled. According to Western diplomatic sources, the Afghan war has intensified in recent weeks despite the signing of the accord. There seems to be no indication the guerrillas will let up their attacks. Since Thursday, Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has been making daily appeals to the guerrillas to join a coalition government and end the conflict so millions of refugees can return home from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The rebels have said they will not share power with the Communists in any future government.

 Rustlers armed with machetes and rifles raided nomad camps at dawn and killed 192 people and injured 50 in a remote part of northwestern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the government said Sunday. The rustlers stole about 3,500 cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys, officials said. Forty of the 50 rustlers were captured and killed and about 3,000 animals were recovered. The sky over the massacre scene was black with vultures. Hyenas and other wild animals ravaged the bodies of the victims, said the Sunday Nation, an independent newspaper. <PERSON> Laban </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitele </PERSON>, a minister of state in the office of the president, said police tracked and killed about 40 of the 50 rustlers in a search aided by recent heavy rains in the district. The rest escaped across the border to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kitele </PERSON> said in a statement that the attackers were a well-armed `` terror gang'' of Sudanese from the Toposas tribe and Ndongiros from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The attackers hit 30 nomadic camps about 30 miles west of the border town of <LOCATION> Lokichoggio </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The semi-arid district, whose mountains and rugged valleys make it inaccessible by car, is near the borders of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. Police recovered 3,000 of about 3,500 animals stolen by the rustlers, <PERSON> Kitele </PERSON> said. On March 30, rustlers hacked 15 nomads to death in northern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and stole 2,000 goats. `` Rustlers have lost all respect for human life to the extent that they will massacre human beings in cold blood,'' <PERSON> Kitele </PERSON> said. `` I wish to warn anybody within <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> or outside still harboring ideas of rustling to desist. ... Government response to rustling will always be prompt and aggressive hot pursuit.'' In the latest incident, rustlers struck at 6 a.m. and killed men, women and children with crude machetes and automatic and semi-automatic rifles, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Haji </PERSON>, the Rift Valley provincial commissioner, told the Sunday Nation. The newspaper had chartered a plane to the area. <PERSON> Haji </PERSON> said he found only bones and skulls left by scavenging animals when he visited the scene. Rustling is a tradition among <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s nomadic tribes, who regularly cross borders in search of pasture for their animals.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who has spent the past 11 years fighting charges he was the notorious <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible,'' faces a verdict Monday in his 14-month-long court battle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The three-judge panel's 450-page judgment is based on more than 15,000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from Holocaust survivors, documents experts and the suspect himself. Holocaust mastermind <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the only other Nazi war criminal to be tried in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was convicted and hanged in 1962. Unlike <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has insisted he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity. The retired autoworker from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is charged with being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. `` Ivan'' allegedly tortured prisoners on their way to their deaths. Many observers argue the case against <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has not been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, despite the tearful insistence of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant as `` Ivan'' more than 40 years after the Holocaust. But few Israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict. For them, the only question is whether the Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, will be spared the death penalty. `` After the emotional accounts of the survivors, people expect a guilty verdict,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bron </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper who covered the trial. `` Many want vengeance and a death sentence, but there is a minority voice calling for life imprisonment.'' If <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is found guilty Monday, he will be sentenced at a later, separate hearing. About 250,000 spectators attended the trial's 106 sessions, which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of $ 650,000. Despite holes in the prosecution case, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was plagued throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to move two steps backward for every step forward. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s relatives raised more than $ 650,000 for the defense, but their lawyers often appeared unprepared, failed to come up with a coherent account of his whereabouts during World War II and antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd. Two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of cross-examination, one claiming the defense had threatened a law suit if he continued to testify. Other defense experts were discredited, including one who retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide after her credentials were questioned. Even <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> grew frustrated, firing <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings. But <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s supporters contend the defendant's biggest problem was being tried before Jewish judges of the same generation as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims testifying against him. One judge, Polish-born <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON>, lost family in the Holocaust. Much of the trial focused on a lengthy, often repetitive debate over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s alleged Nazi identity card. About 500 exhibits, including a paper clip, were submitted to bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card was authentic. Six defense witnesses maintained the document was fake. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> contends the document was fabricated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to punish him for serving in an anti-Communist unit formed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> at the end of World War II. Although interest waned and frustration mounted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s trial dragged on for months, some Israelis say the fact that it took place at all has healed some wounds. `` The trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many Holocaust victims,'' said Cleveland-born <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, whose father-in-law, <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON>, lost his entire family in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps. He always refused to talk about his experiences but `` there was something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep well,'' she said. `` He began to release all those pent-up feelings.'' But the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims who attended the trial over the year. `` If the judges do n't find him guilty, I think I'll kill myself,'' said Holocaust survivor <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, 63, as he tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents, three brothers and a sister killed at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. Even if <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> wins an acquittal Monday, he will not walk away from the converted movie theater in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> a free man. Stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship before extradition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in February 1986, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is stateless. Lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to consider reactivating plans to deport <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Such a move had been a possibility before 1983, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> requested his extradition. `` This is a man without a nation, he has no papers. When the trial ends, our problems do n't end. They're only beginning,'' said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>.

 Amid complaints that the people deserve a park more than the dogs, canines have won free running time in Laurel Canyon Park atop the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic church leader on Sunday urged President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> to be more flexible in his demands so that peace talks can resume with left-wing rebels. Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was too firm in his demands that the guerrillas lay down their weapons and participate in political activities before the stalled negotiations can continue. `` I see that this is a position in which he should also take into account the greater aspirations of the people. If he really takes into account popular sentiments he should modify it,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said. He spoke to reporters briefly after saying Mass at the Metropolitan Cathedral. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of five guerrilla groups, is demanding a share of power immediately. Front leaders have said such a coalition government should rewrite the constitution and organize elections while the rebel combatants would be integrated into the armed forces. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, said earlier this month he would not budge in his demands. `` I can not allow them -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- to get away with a formula in which they acquire power through force of arms,'' he said during the inauguration of a new government hospital in a the western part of the country. Government and rebel representatives held three meetings between Oct. 15, 1984, and Oct. 5, 1987. All ended in deadlock. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> had acted as mediator in the negotiations. The rebels broke off the last round ot talks in protest against the assassination of a prominent human rights activist. Peace negotiations are called for under a regional plan that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and the four other <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents signed last August in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The plan calls for cease-fires in the conflicts in the Central American countries, an end to outside military aid to insurgents and reforms to bring about greater democracy. Human rights groups say more than 65,000 people have been slain in political violence in the Salvadoran civil war that began in 1979, with most of the victims civilians.

 Police arrested 147 people in a weekend sweep aimed at street gangs as the movie `` Colors,'' which some people fear will incite gang violence, opened with only a few minor disturbances, authorities said Sunday. Trouble at a theater in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and another in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> led to cancellation of the film, but few problems were reported in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> despite predictions that the portrayal of the local Crips and Bloods gangs would cause bloodshed. A 200-member police task force Saturday night stopped suspected gang members on the street and checked for outstanding warrants, making 147 felony and misdemeanor arrests. Seventy-three of those arrested were suspected gang members, said Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>. One <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> man was killed Saturday in gang violence unrelated to the movie. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Voldseth </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Sunland </LOCATION> was stabbed by two gang members during a drug deal in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Pacioma </LOCATION>, police said. No violence was reported Saturday night at theaters showing `` Colors'' in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and neighboring suburbs. At the film's opening Friday, minor scuffles prompted 13 arrests `` So far, we have had no reaction whatsoever from the kids,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Talanoa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Inglewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In affluent <PERSON> Westwood </PERSON>, where a woman was killed by a stray bullet during a gang confrontation in January, there were no incidents at the two theaters showing the film. `` Maybe it wo n't be as volatile as people think, said Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The Guardian Angels, the self-styled crime-fighters, had been among those claiming the film glorified gangs and would prompt more violence. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnell </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where 10 of Friday's arrests were made, said the 1,000-seat theater is continuing to sell out for evening shows. He said Saturday's performance sparked no violence `` It's only a movie,'' <PERSON> Schnell </PERSON> said. `` Everybody seems pleased with it.'' In the community of <LOCATION> Colma </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dollosso </PERSON> ordered a downtown theater to stop showing the movie Saturday because, police said, crowds outside the theater nearly got out of hand Friday night. A theater at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> shopping center stopped showing `` Colors'' after a shouting match at a screening Friday. `` Colors,'' an Orion release starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officers in a police anti-gang unit, opened at 425 theaters nationwide. Director <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> employed real gang members as extras during filming and relied on off-duty officers as technical advisers. Before the movie opened, about 15 theaters nationwide reportedly dropped plans to show the film. One downtown Los Angeles theater and two theaters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> communities troubled by gang violence canceled the film. Between Jan. 1 and April 4, there were 89 gang-related deaths in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths in the area. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, meanwhile, police reported a shooting early Sunday outside a five-theater complex where `` Colors'' had been shown. A manager at Showcase Cinema who asked not to be identified said he believed the shooting was unrelated to `` Colors'' and that those involved had seen a different film. The shooting broke windows at the cinema and injured an 18-year-old man, whom police refused to identify.

<HEAD>Fight Over Hearsay Evidence, Dying Declaration Expected In
Chambers Case</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The freedom of a former <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> police chief accused of killing his wife's first husband could hinge on whether a statement made by the chief's father just before his death will be admitted as evidence in court. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 36, was charged with second-degree murder Friday and spent the weekend in the <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> after failing to make $ 200,000 bail. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. He was charged one month after authorities dug up the remains of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, whose body was secretly buried in the chief's yard 10 years ago. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> lawyer and former professor at <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> specializing in evidence, said the case may `` rise or fall on many of the judge's rulings on admissibility of evidence.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said he expected Chambers' defense to challenge the use of the father's statement, but he said the prosecution had enough evidence to win a conviction even without the statement Bean's remains were found buried 25 feet deep in Chambers' yard on March 14. An autopsy showed he appeared to have been beaten with a blunt instrument on the head and chest. Police acted after Chambers' sister, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, gave them a tip on March 10, the day after the death of her father, 61-year-old <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said in affidavits that her father told her he had helped his son bury the body after <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> admitted accidentally killing Bean in a fight. She said her father told her to tell police the story upon his death. <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' granddaughter, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, gave police a similar affidavit. Public defender <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisti </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, said he would `` disagree strenuously'' with the use of the father's statements as hearsay evidence. In homicide cases, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> courts allow hearsay evidence to be admitted when it involves deathbed confessions. But <PERSON> Sisti </PERSON> said the father's statement would not qualify because it did not concern a person the father thought was causing his own death. Also, the lawyer said the father's words were n't a dying statement because he spoke to his daughter and granddaughter days before he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died. The state rules provide other exceptions for using hearsay evidence, but the defense could challenge it on the grounds that the father's reliability as a witness can not be tested and that Chambers can not be granted his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said he anticipates the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will settle the admissibility of the father's statement. `` I feel very doubtful that <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> would ever -LRB- have -RRB- been found'' without the father's statement, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said. But he said investigators, after talking to 15 or 20 people, have enough evidence to convict Chambers even without the declaration. He did not elaborate. Bean, 25 when he was last seen in 1978, was a good friend of Chambers. Chambers and his wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, swapped partners with <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, according to affadivits by <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' brother-in-law, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> divorced Bean after he disappeared and Chambers divorced <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, and then <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> married. They separated after Bean's remains were found. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> has denied any wife-swapping. Chambers has resigned as <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON>'s part-time chief and took a leave of absence as part-time chief of nearby Gilsum.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, predicts his candidate will win about 40 percent of the vote in this week's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic primary. But <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> contends that for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is not a `` must-win'' contest. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s in a position where obviously he does not have to win. But -LRB- <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does,'' he said. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, who was federal budget director in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration and has served as an unofficial adviser to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could benefit from a close second-place finish in the Tuesday primary. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Rome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Tribune </ORGANIZATION> last week he thinks <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will improve on his 25 percent showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1984. Depending on how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> split the remaining votes, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> said, 40 percent could be enough to win. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> posted a strong victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, that would result in `` great pressure by those who do n't want to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continue to do well, to try to say it's all over,'' <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> warned against premature statements that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the Democratic nomination wrapped up. `` Whether that's accurate, you still have to wait and see,'' he said. `` You ca n't deny the people the right to make their choice. And, that means you've got to go through that whole process, because <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> all are still to come.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> returned Sunday from a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and said the capture of renegade soldiers during her absence proved political stability was a `` permanent condition in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` No one can say now that political stability in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is a daily battle that must be waged by the president herself,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said during a welcoming ceremony at a heavily guarded air base near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. She left Thursday for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and returned home after an overnight stay in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. It was her first trip abroad since visiting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in November 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> became the chief executive after President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled the country in February 1968 during a civilian-military revolt. He is now living in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` I think we have done our country proud during this trip,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` More particularly the Filipino people, who have shown once and for all that freedom and stability are not weak and fragile achievements but a permanent condition in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' On Friday, troops captured 10 followers of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, including eight navy guards who helped <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escape on April 2 from a prison ship. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> had escaped from the ship accompanied by 14 of his guards. The military went on full alert to prevent <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> from leading an attack while the president was abroad. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led an Aug. 28 revolt in which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> won pledges of support from senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> for her government, which is seeking to crush a 19-year-old communist insurgency. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> agreed to increase trade from an annual $ 293 million to $ 800 million in five years. The Chinese also pledged to reduce the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' trade deficit by importing more goods from this country, she said. `` On the intangible but far from unimportant side, a truer and deeper understanding has been achieved by the leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` And with that understanding has come apparently an appreciation on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s part for what we are trying to achieve here. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> expressed the support of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for our government and our aims to achieve economic progress.'' Some people at the airport chanted, `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>,'' while others held banners of support for her government. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguindam </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filipinos </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of 14 associations representing about 6,000 maids and servants, said she tried to hand Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> a letter but was thwarted by bodyguards. The letter reiterated demands that the working conditions of maids from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> who work in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> be improved and expressed opposition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had met with Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but no details of their conversation were released. Officials in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said earlier Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would ask the governor for help in improving the maids' working conditions. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited the village of <LOCATION> Hongjian </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province, birthplace of her great-grandfather who emigrated to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the 19th century. There she met with some 40 distant relatives. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the trip despite calls from some supporters and opposition leaders for her to cancel it because of a possible coup attempt. She said postponing the trip would indicate her government was unstable. She canceled a scheduled visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in October because of the political turmoil in the wake of the August rebellion.

 Palestinians angered by the assassination of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader boycotted their jobs and staged protest marches Sunday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> imposed curfews on cities and camps in the occupied territories. Eight Arabs were wounded in scattered clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for Saturday's killing of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Many protesters carried black flags Sunday to mourn his death. Also Sunday, most of about 100,000 Arabs who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed away from their jobs. Most businesses in the occupied territories were closed in the new general strike called to protest <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s death. The strike coincided with the beginning of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, a month-long Moslem period of fasting. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Obeidiyeh </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, about 4,000 Arabs held a march Sunday before prayers, chanting anti-Israeli slogans. Arab witnesses said three protesters suffered injuries from beatings by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers who used force to disperse the march. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> once lived and where he still has relatives, soldiers opened fire on teen-agers who blocked roads with burning tires and stoned the troops. Six rioters were wounded, according to officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Troops also shot and wounded two Palestinians near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after the Arabs tried to assault the soldiers with hatchets, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The army confirmed the report. The death toll from violence that swept the occupied lands after <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s slaying rose to 17. A 13-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man died Sunday from bullet wounds inflicted the day before, according to Palestinian sources. The Israeli military command said the reports were being checked. Saturday's death toll was the worst in a single day since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. At least 166 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. As <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s No. 2 man, <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> supervised military operations in the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 Middle East War. As main military planner for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, he was held responsible by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a list of bloody terror attacks, including a bus hijacking last month in which three Israelis were killed. However, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refrained from directly addressing Palestinian charges and press reports saying it was behind <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s The Israeli-owned <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that the army declared all cities and towns and most of the highways in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as closed military zones An army spokesman said the military imposed a curfew on 22 refugee camps and villages in the occupied territories. He said the army also barred journalists and non-residents from <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest city in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> with a population of 100,000. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Sunday, Israeli police detained an Arab American activist, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, for 30 minutes at the gates one of Islam's holiest site, the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said A Christian who advocates non-violent resistance, he was accompanying two Greek Orthodox priests to express sympathy to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> mourners at a memorial service for <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also threatened Sunday to shut two Arab-owned weekly magazines published in Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Last month, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a daily news service for foreign journalists, for six months. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rebellion to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military rule has hurt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tourist industry, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The report said government statistics released Sunday showed 142,000 tourists visited the country in March, or 17 percent fewer than in January and February. March is usually one of the peak months for tourism because of the Easter and Passover holidays. Meanwhile, figures from a sample of 150 Israeli factories showed up to 10 percent losses in sales per factory last month because of a boycott of Israeli goods by Arabs in the occupied territories, the radio said. Economic Affairs Minister <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacobi </PERSON> has estimated that the Palestinian uprising has cost the economy at least $ 300 million.

 Hundreds of make-believe British troops and American colonists wearing 18th century uniforms Sunday fired blanks from their muskets and flintlocks in mock battles replaying the start of the Revolutionary War. They were two days early, making a concession for the weekend.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Seeks Farm-Subsidy Accord by December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade envoy Sunday called for a framework agreement by December to end the global farm subsidy war, but the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION>'s farm commissioner failed to budge on the issue. Following weekend talks with his counterparts from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said there was no justification for industrialized countries to continue subsidizing exports of farm products or other goods. But <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also said at a news conference following the ministerial retreat on <LOCATION> Quadra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> that the meeting had seen little progress in resolving the issue. The retreat was one of two weekend Quadrilateral Trade Meetings held each year. The next is scheduled for <LOCATION> Gull </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on June 22-24. Realistically, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would like an outline agreement by December on eliminating farm subsidies within the 95-nation General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> agreement is being renegotiated in a round of talks launched in September 1986 in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Este </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. A crucial mid-term meeting of all members is scheduled in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> next December. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed phasing out of farm subsidies that create export surpluses by the year 2000. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> acknowledged that the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ whose subsidy-heavy budget is dominated by its farm program _ considered the target unrealistic and said he was willing to look at a longer time frame. `` But let's not conclude that it's impossible to rid the world of these onerous practices,'' he said. European Community Trade Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> already had adopted a policy of curbing farm production. But he described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal as unreasonable and accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of preaching free trade while practicing intervention. `` Both of us spend about $ 30 billion -LRB- a year -RRB- to support farming,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> told reporters. `` There are about 2.5 to 3 million farmers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 12 million in the European Community. It's not difficult to draw the conclusion which farmers are more supported.'' He cited a recent increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export enhancement program under which nearly 12 million tons of cut-rate wheat was sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past year. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was willing to negotiate on farm subsidies but only as part of a balanced `` global package'' covering areas such as investment, services and improved access for products from tropical Third World countries.

 Israeli sources said Sunday that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents had assassinated <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the organization who headed the uprising in the occupied territories. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declined comment. The sources said the operation was carried out jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> intelligence service, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> navy and an elite commando unit. They spoke on condition of anonymity. They said it had been postponed several times before Saturday. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>, who was in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was shot to death Saturday at his home in the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsa </LOCATION> by an eight-member squad. <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, saying the killing was designed to demoralize Palestinians and end PLO-directed protests in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` I'm not ready to relate to these matters,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his office in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> when asked about reports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was behind the operation. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday night it had been told that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was so happy at the success of the operation he sent a message congratulating the commandos while they were still sailing home. It did not say who provided that information but said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spent a tense Friday night waiting for the news and was overjoyed there were no Israeli casualities. The report said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the military chief of staff the assassination showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could strike far and fast. The Israeli news media no mention of such a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> message and the prime minister could not be reached late Sunday for comment on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> report. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, co-leader of the coalition government, said in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that he hoped <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination would not affect peace efforts. Apparently referring to <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, he added: `` We have to uproot violence as a ... factor that delays a political development. People who use violence will in the end see the limits of violence. It leads nowhere.'' The issue came up only briefly in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s regular Cabinet meeting Sunday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said that when <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was asked what happened, he said he had heard the details on the radio. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> approved the assassination after <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three Israelis in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert last month. Former intelligence officials and Israeli newspapers openly compared the assassination to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s April 1973 raid on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which three top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials were killed. They also noted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, not rival <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions or Arab regimes, had the ability to mount such a sophisticated operation 1,500 miles from its shores. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>, who resigned as head of a defense ministry intelligence unit after the <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> spy scandal in 1985, said, `` there is no doubt there is a parallel'' between the attacks. The 1973 slaying was aimed at <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s security and intelligence chief who later died in a car bomb attack. Instead, <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adwan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Najjar </PERSON>, a key figure in the Black September terror group, were killed. In the 1973 attack, the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> put a commando team ashore, rented cars were used to get to and from the target, documents were seized and a women participated in the raid. In Saturday's attack, rented cars were used, documents taken and a woman was among the hit team. Israeli experts say <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> was responsible for a list of bloody attacks such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijacking in which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded. Three Israelis involved in the 1973 raid now hold senior security positions. The raid's leader was Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON>, now head of military intelligence, it was planned by Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, the current deputy chief of staff, and one of the commandos was Col. <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s adviser on terrorism. In an interview conducted before the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> attack and published this week by the army weekly <PERSON> Bamahane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had a policy of striking at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla leaders. `` In my opinion whoever leads acts of terror is a proper target for liquidation. Whoever uses terrorism against us should be a target,'' <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Asked if such an operation could be mounted now, he said `` I have no doubt that today it's possible to do it, only better.'' Similar remarks came from <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> who told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper April 12 that `` we have to initiate deadly attacks against the terrorist leaders.'' The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had several motives to kill <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>. These included showing the Palestinians that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could strike a deadly blow from a great distance and demonstrate to the Arab world that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military capabilities had not weakened.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who has spent the past 11 years fighting charges he was the notorious <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible,'' faces a verdict Monday in his 14-month-long court battle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The three-judge panel's 450-page judgment is based on more than 15,000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from Holocaust survivors, documents experts and the suspect himself. Holocaust mastermind <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the only other Nazi war criminal to be tried in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was convicted and hanged in 1962. Unlike <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has insisted he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity. The retired autoworker from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is charged with being a brutally sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. `` Ivan'' allegedly tortured prisoners on their way to their deaths. During the trial witnesses told the court that `` Ivan the Terrible'' would stand near the entrance of the gas chambers and strike the doomed prisoners with a metal bar or bayonet. Many observers argue the case against <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has not been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, despite the tearful insistence of five death camp survivors who claim to recognize the defendant as `` Ivan'' more than 40 years after the Holocaust. But few Israelis doubt the judges will hand in a guilty verdict. For them, the only question is whether the Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, will be spared the death penalty. `` After the emotional accounts of the survivors, people expect a guilty verdict,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bron </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper who covered the trial. `` Many want vengeance and a death sentence, but there is a minority voice calling for life imprisonment.'' If <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is found guilty Monday, he will be sentenced at a later, separate hearing. About 250,000 spectators attended the trial's 106 sessions, which the government held in a converted movie theater at a cost of $ 650,000. Despite holes in the prosecution case, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was plagued throughout the trial by a stumbling defense team which seemed to move two steps backward for every step forward. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s relatives raised more than $ 650,000 for the defense, but their lawyers often appeared unprepared, failed to come up with a coherent account of his whereabouts during World War II and antagonized judges by engaging in behavior bordering on the absurd. Two defense witnesses walked off the stand in the middle of cross-examination, one claiming the defense had threatened a law suit if he continued to testify. Other defense experts were discredited, including one who retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide after her credentials were questioned. Even <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> grew frustrated, firing <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings. But <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s supporters contend the defendant's biggest problem was being tried before Jewish judges of the same generation as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims testifying against him. One judge, Polish-born <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON>, lost family in the Holocaust. Much of the trial focused on a lengthy, often repetitive debate over the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s alleged Nazi identity card. About 500 exhibits, including a paper clip, were submitted to bolster the testimony of six prosecution experts who said the card was authentic. Six defense witnesses maintained the document was fake. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> contends the document was fabricated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to punish him for serving in an anti-Communist unit formed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> at the end of World War II. Although interest waned and frustration mounted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s trial dragged on for months, some Israelis say the fact that it took place at all has healed some wounds. `` The trial has served as a kind of catharsis for many Holocaust victims,'' said Cleveland-born <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, whose father-in-law, <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON>, lost his entire family in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps. He always refused to talk about his experiences but `` there was something about the trial that just opened up some kind of deep well,'' she said. `` He began to release all those pent-up feelings.'' But the prospect of a verdict has brought mixed emotions to dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims who attended the trial over the year. `` If the judges do n't find him guilty, I think I'll kill myself,'' said Holocaust survivor <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, 63, as he tearfully fingered a worn photograph of his parents, three brothers and a sister killed at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. Even if <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> wins an acquittal Monday, he will not walk away from the converted movie theater in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> a free man. Stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship before extradition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in February 1986, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is stateless. Lawyers say that if he is acquitted they expect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to consider reactivating plans to deport <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Such a move had been a possibility before 1983, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> requested his extradition. `` This is a man without a nation, he has no papers. When the trial ends, our problems do n't end. They're only beginning,'' said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>.

 A fire that threatened an entire downtown block of old Victorian buildings badly damaged two buildings occupied by squatters and killed one woman, officials said Sunday. The fire, of undetermined cause, also badly damaged a three-story house that had been converted into an apartment building. Total damages were estimated at $ 400,000, assistant fire Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said. The blaze began about 10:30 p.m. Saturday about a block from the city's new Hyatt Regency Hotel and was so intense that half the city's firefighting force was called out, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said. It took 90 minutes to bring the fire under control. `` The main problem was it was a congested block of 100-year-old buildings and it would have gone through them in a few minutes,'' said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. One of the squatter buildings belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> society columnist <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and had been the center of controversy for months. Homeless people had occupied the building to seek shelter from the winter. Police removed them once, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said, but squatters broke back in a short while later. The coroners office said Sunday it was trying to unravel `` conflicting stories'' about the identity of the dead woman found in one of the squatter buildings.

 The boyfriend of one of four brutally slain teen-agers blames authorities for not arresting the murder suspect after the man allegedly threatened him with a knife and smashed his pickup truck. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who had been dating 17-year-old <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> for about six weeks, said Saturday that if police and prosecutors had acted more quickly, the bloodbath in which <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> and three siblings died might have been avoided. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he filed charges against <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s jealous ex-boyfriend after an incident on March 28, spoke with police repeatedly and gave detectives statements. `` I thought when someone attempted to kill someone, they picked him up, and off to jail he went,'' the truck driver said Saturday. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON>, 20, was arrested after Friday's killings and is being held on four capital murder charges and another charge in lieu of a $ 4.05 million bond. Authorities found cuts on <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON>'s arms and stabs to the thigh. But the suspect's father, <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, said one of his son's friends told him the wounds were received in a fight with another man at the Manns' home the evening of the slayings. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> had been trying to get <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> to leave her alone for more than a year without success. The <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> family moved just 2 -LCB- weeks ago to get away from <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON>'s constant harassment and alleged break-ins, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 24, said <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> went on a jealous rampage on March 28, breaking out the windows and bashing the fenders of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s 4-month-old pickup, causing about $ 2,000 in damage He said <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> later repeatedly threatened to kill him with a fish-cleaning knife. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he averted an attack by hitting <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> on the side of the neck with a baseball bat and knocking him down. The suspect's father said his son told him he smashed the truck windows because <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> tried to run over him, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. When police arrived at the <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> family's home after that incident, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he thought they were going to take <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> to jail. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> and her 19-year-old sister <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> also went to police headquarters Tuesday to give statements on the incident, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. They were killed Friday, along with their 15-year-old sister <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> and 11-year-old brother <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who visited with the teen-agers' parents Friday, said he is outraged at what he considers foot-dragging by police and prosecutors The elder <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> claims his son is innocent and was in love with one of the victims. `` He is not the type of boy who would do a foolish thing like that,'' he said, adding that his family has been harrassed by threatening and obscene phone calls. Law enforcement officials responded Saturday that even if they had speeded up development of the cases against <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON>, the criminal justice system is so clogged it probably would have taken even more time to secure his arrest. After the March 28 incident police opened two separate investigations, one for a misdemeanor terroristic threat handled by the homicide division and one for third-degree felony criminal mischief handled by the burglary detail. Homicide Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Akeroyd </PERSON> said Saturday the investigation into the terroristic threat was completed and `` walked over to the district attorney's office'' April 5 but no action was taken. District Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he was told Friday that his office had accepted the misdemeanor case, and he asked why an arrest warrant had not been issued. `` What I was told was no warrant was issued because the misdemeanor courts do not issue arrest warrants in Class B misdemeanor cases because of the flood of cases they handle and the overcrowded jail situation,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` The court would have issued a summons'' for <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> to appear in court. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, who screens criminal cases submitted for prosecution, said his office had not yet issued a summons in that case. On the felony criminal mischief case, <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said it at one point was rejected by the district attorney's office because it did not have <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s statement as the victim attached. `` We were forced to send the case back to the police,'' <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said. `` We then accepted the case the day before -LRB- the murders -RRB-,'' after police returned the case with the missing statement attached.

<TEXT>
 A passenger aboard a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet said Sunday about 35 hostages on the plane faced certain death if <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> refused to release 17 convicted terrorists. `` All the passengers are in good health. I hope the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> government will act quickly to liberate the 17 young prisoners. Otherwise we all face a black end,'' said the man. He identified himself as <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Farhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Doukhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Doukhi </PERSON>, who spoke Arabic in a firm voice, also sent `` greetings to the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> people, to my mother and father and to all those who miss me.'' The message appeared to be a recording. On Friday, the hijackers brought two other passengers to the aircraft's radio to make similar statements to the control tower and one on Thursday. Shortly bt Sunday, several Algerian police cars traveled to and from the plane. It could not be determined who was in the cars. The Kuwaiti delegation remained in an airport lounge well after midnight. It was the latest the delegation had stayed at the airport since negotiations began, leading to speculation the hijackers might make a gesture connected with the Moslems' observance of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the month-long period of fasting. <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> begins Monday. Since the Bangkok-to-Kuwait flight was hijacked April 5, the hijackers have demanded the release of the 17 extremists, jailed for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in December 1983. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has rejected the demand. The plane, carrying 112 passengers, first landed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 hostages were released and additional hijackers reportedly boarded the plane. The jet then went to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where the gunmen killed two passengers and released 13. On Wednesday, it arrived in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and on Friday the hijackers released an ailing hostage. Algerian officials said Sunday that <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expected in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> but declined to say when he would arrive or whether he would play a role in the negotiations. On the morning of the 13th day of the crisis, Algerian authorities abruptly expelled hundreds of print and television reporters from the section of the VIP lounge where they had been staying for nearly a week. Reporters moved into tents, erected by Algerian security men, on the lawn near the lounge. At about the same time, Algerian policemen, armed with pistols, took up position on the roof of the terminal building facing the plane. It was not clear why they had been dispatched. One official, who refused to be identified by name, said the lounge was needed for Arab ambassadors expected to come to the airport for a possible expansion of the negotiations. The official declined to provide any details. The Shiite Moslem gunmen have threatened to fly the jet out of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> `` to settle our score with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> somewhere else.'' Early Sunday, they said they would extend their `` departure time warning'' to pursue negotiations. There has been no indication of where they might go. The estimated five to eight hijackers asked for and received about 6,600 gallons of fuel to maintain conditions inside the plane, but did not set a deadline or directly repeat their previous threats to kill the hostages and blow up the plane. The hijackers also asked for and were given newspapers. On Saturday, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruler, telephoned President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to ask that the plane not be allowed to leave. In a brief statement in Arabic to the control tower, the hijackers said, `` At the request of our brothers the Algerians we announce that we have agreed to extend the departure time warning to give an opportunity for the efforts by the Algerians.'' Algerian negotiators boarded the blue and white <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 twice during the day, first at 11:10 a.m. -LRB- 6:10 a.m. -RRB- and again at 4:45 p.m. -LRB- 11:45 a.m. -RRB-. Inside the airport terminal building, Algerian Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON> pursued negotiations with a high-level <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation. The hijackers asked Sunday for a special meal before the beginning of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. The Algerians delivered Souhour, the traditional meal of fermented cheese and dates. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the emir and the crown prince canceled traditional receptions marking Islam's holiest month out of respect for the hostages, newspapers reported. And leading members of Kuwaits' minority <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sect denounced the ongoing hijack as anti-Islamic. The public denunciation appeared to be an effort to defuse potential strains in relations between Shiites and the majority Sunni Moslem community.

 A trapeze artist fell to her death Sunday, hitting the floor of a circus tent headfirst before about 900 horrified spectators, police said. <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Amandis </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> was performing alone without a net about 17 feet above center ring of <LOCATION> Circus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> when she missed a maneuver, said police and circus owner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobbs </PERSON>. While swinging back and forth balancing on her back, she attempted to drop upside down and catch the bar with her knees, <PERSON> Mobbs </PERSON> said. Performing without using her hands, she missed the bar and fell. `` She fell forward and she was trying to right herself up, and by doing that she fell right on the side of her face. She was n't that high up She just hit the wrong way,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>, who was at the show with his two children. His wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, said, `` At the second she fell, everybody was silent. Everybody thought it was part of the act. Then we realized what had happened.'' Spectator <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> said, `` I saw it when it happened. I just turned my head and said, ` Oh my God. She fell.''' `` The crew wanted to go on with the show in her memory,'' <PERSON> Mobbs </PERSON> said, but the performance was immediately ended because police evacuated the audience. Ms. <PERSON> Amandis </PERSON> was the first act after an intermission. <PERSON> Mobbs </PERSON> described the solo trapeze act as perhaps the hardest in the circus because there is no one else to rely on. `` She was one of the best in the business. She preferred not to work with a net. She felt it limited her,'' he said. Ringmaster <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said, `` I watched the whole thing. I've seen a lot of them in this business It's part of the risk that you take.'' Ms. <PERSON> Amandis </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, had performed with several circuses and was respected as one of the world's best trapeze artist, <PERSON> Mobbs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Amandis </PERSON> was the performer's stage name, police Sgt. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hierro </PERSON> said, and she also was known as <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Visingard </PERSON>. The Miami-based circus had erected its big top across from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> festival. <PERSON> Mobbs </PERSON> said he assembles the circus two or three times a year for shows in the area.

 Police on Sunday searched for five men who escaped from <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> jail during a nationwide strike by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s 1,900 guards, and disturbances were reported at two <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> prisons A former <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla sentenced to 40 years in prison last week reportedly was involved in one of the disturbances. Five inmates fled Saturday night near the end of a recreation period at the strikebound Cork jail, police said. Three other prisoners who escaped at the same time were recaptured within minutes, they said. In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s St. Patrick's Institution for young offenders, police scuffled with eight prisoners who barricaded themselves inside their cells Saturday, police said. Also Saturday, former <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla <PERSON> Dessie </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> was among prisoners who helped smash up cells in the high-security <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION> prison, 47 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, police said. <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION> holds about 130 Irish nationalist guerrillas. <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, 29, was sentenced to prison Wednesday for kidnapping a wealthy <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> dentist.

 A bomb exploded in front of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Jewish Community Center shortly after midnight Sunday, and minutes later another blast ripped through the downtown office of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saudia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, police said.

<TEXT>
 The body of a newborn girl was found in the toilet of a state psychiatric hospital after the baby's mother, a patient, gave birth unattended, authorities say. The <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office, local and state police are investigating the incident to determine whether the child was stillborn or died after birth. Mental health groups, meanwhile, questioned how a woman could give birth unnoticed in a crowded hospital ward. Staff at <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> checked the mother 15 minutes before the baby's body was found last Tuesday night and found no indication that she was in labor, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Devane </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The baby's body was discovered after the mother appeared with her legs covered with blood, and workers followed a bloody trail to a communal bathroom, <PERSON> Devane </PERSON> said Saturday. No charges have been filed against the mother, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ales </PERSON>, 34, who was pregnant when admitted to the hospital in October, authorities say. Hospital officials declined to discuss Ms. Ales' mental condition `` I find it incredible that this could happen and nobody knew she was was in labor,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` Does it take the death of a newborn baby to recognize that our underfunded and understaffed state mental health facilities can pose a threat to the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens?'' she asked. <PERSON> Devane </PERSON> said state laws require the department to serve patients in the `` least restrictive'' environment possible. There was no indication, he said, that Ms. Ales might harm herself or the child. <PERSON> Devane </PERSON> said the general psychiatric ward on which Ms. <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> was a patient had 24 patients and four staff members.

<TEXT>
 The name of a senator shot to death in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was included on an assassination list found in hideouts of the Red Brigades terrorist organization, an official was quoted as saying Sunday. Sen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON> was killed Saturday at his apartment in the town of <LOCATION> Forli </LOCATION>. He had been shot twice in the back of the neck, an autopsy showed. <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>, 51, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, was a close friend and adviser of Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> and had been developing a plan to improve <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s slow-moving bureacracy. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Priore </PERSON>, an investigating magistrate, told RAI state television that <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>'s name appeared on a list of possible targets found in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brigades </LOCATION> hideouts in past months. An anonymous caller to the <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION> office of the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday asserted responsibility for the killing on behalf of the Red Brigades. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> quoted the caller as saying, `` We have killed Sen. <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>, attacking at the heart of the state. Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party.'' The Fighting Communist Party is a faction of the Red Brigades. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> presided at an emergency meeting Sunday that included the interior minister and police officials, but few developments in the case were reported. At <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>'s urging, <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON> had been developing the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' plan to reform <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s cumbersome bureaucracy and lawmaking process. <PERSON> Priore </PERSON> said one of the <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s goals, according to seized documents, was to thwart the process to reform <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s institutions. One of their biggest fears `` was new legislation that would make the state more efficient,'' <PERSON> Priore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>'s killing came exactly 40 years after a national election that ended the communists participation in government. A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> to express his sorrow about <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>'s death, saying `` the Italian nation is threatened, but we hope and pray.'' Meanwhile, an anti-terrorist investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, raised the possibility that the killing was linked to the car bombing Thursday outside a <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.O </LOCATION>. club in which an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> servicewoman and four Italians were killed. The investigator said the killing of <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON> might have been timed to divert attention of security forces looking for <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist suspected in the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> bombing. The investigator noted that terrorists of the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the Italian Red Brigades have trained together in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and have links to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorists.

 It may sound like a childhood nightmare come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions. But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry officials say the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s grapefruit-size variety known as the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for more. At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion. `` They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass and ship them UPS -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> horticultural scientist who developed the 1015. Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $ 1 million in research grants for the continuing project that <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> leads in the quest for a sweeter, milder onion. He released his round, yellow <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Grano 1015 _ named for the optimum planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as opposed to flatter, `` Granex'' onions. `` It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating onions that did n't eat them before,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBerry </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Progreso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the trend. `` You can see that by the number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s.'' The sweet spring onions are available only for a six-week period beginning in mid-April. <PERSON> DeBerry </PERSON>'s company and others have started labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name. `` Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I know that sounds strange,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouchek </PERSON>, executive director of the Harlingen-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's designer onions `` There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,'' she said. About 80 percent of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' onion crop is the sweet spring variety, said <PERSON> Erv </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandlin </PERSON>, a promotional marketing coordinator with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> onion growers got $ 77.8 million for their crop last year, making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierstedt </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of which 14,000 is for the spring crop, <PERSON> Bierstedt </PERSON> said. About 3,500 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> acres are planted in the 1015. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' niche in the national market is that its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> spring crop hits the market early, growers say. Until the spring onions hit the market, consumers are eating the more pungent winter storage variety grown in many states. `` We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about gone and spring begins,'' said <PERSON> Othal </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> McAllen-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is the largest onion producer in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. On an early spring afternoon, <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, who is mayor of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop. `` Is n't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the bulbs up. `` The only thing prettier than that is money in the bank.'' Other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> onions usually begin hitting the market before the 1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage, growers say. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said he is working on ways to store the spring onions longer. He also is researching the source of the 1015's mildness, which he said stems mainly from a low level of pyruvic acid, which reacts with sulfur compounds to produce some of the unsavory qualities in a more typical onion. `` Very rarely will you get one -LRB- 1015 -RRB- that will bring tears to your eyes,'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said. The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will eat the mild ones of the spring season. Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been reported at three pounds, according to <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Invesment Group Buying Out Yugo America-Founder Malcolm Bricklin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, whose failed 1970s sports car venture preceded his introduction of the cut-priced <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is being bought out of his auto importing business, the president of <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced the $ 3,900 Yugoslavian-built auto to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in August 1985, and of <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to import a Malaysian-built car by year's end. An investor-management group headed by <ORGANIZATION> Mabon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker, agreed three weeks ago to give <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> a cash infusion in exchange for Global stock and debt, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Prior </PERSON>, Global's president. The deal was to be announced publicly on Monday, and explanatory letters were mailed to <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> dealers late last week, Prior said in an interview. The deal was expected to close within a week, he said. <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, through Prior, declined comment. `` He just has other interests that he intends to pursue outside the automobile business,'' Prior said Friday of <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, adding he did n't believe <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> was being squeezed out. Prior said the investor group will inject more than $ 40 million into the company. Global will pay about $ 20 million for <ORGANIZATION> Bricklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' 60 percent to 70 percent stake in the business and will inject at least that amount into the business itself. <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> also will sell the company his personal Global stake. <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, who will remain a paid consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, introduced his gull-winged, acrylic-and-fiberglass bodied SV-1 sports car in 1974. But production never neared his 12,000-a-year goal, and the company died in 1976. The little Yugo, marketed as basic, cheap transportation and aimed at buyers who otherwise might buy used cars, sold so fast after its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> introduction that dealers never had enough to fill orders. But it soon came to be known as a shoddily built, poorly designed vehicle. In the February 1986 Consumer Reports, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> commented: `` It is hard to recommend the <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> at any price. The Yugo scores below every other car we've tested in recent years.'' Two years later, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s opinion had n't improved despite thousands of changes made to the car and a price increase to $ 4,199. `` The Yugo is the cheapest car on the market. Unfortunately, it's also one of the worst cars CU has ever tested. ... The money saved in buying a Yugo may well be spent in maintaining it.'' <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, who at age 29 had introduced the Subaru to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1968, said in early 1985 that by <PERSON> Yugo </PERSON>'s second year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he expected sales of 150,000. By its third year, he planned to sell 250,000. But the <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation was so poor and its competition in the new, low-end market so tough that less than 50,000 were sold in 1987, its second full year of sales. First-quarter sales in 1988 fell 36 percent from a year earlier. Instead, the South Korean-made <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION>, the first of several <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> competitors who crowded into the cheap-car market, set a first-year import sales record of 150,000 units in 1986. In January, <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> mounted an aggressive campaign including a $ 48 million advertising budget and the introduction of the <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> GVX, with a stronger engine and suspension and more frills. It also provided a one-year, complete warranty that Prior estimated will cost <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> $ 19 million annually. During the first year, <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pays for all maintenance and parts, routine or not. In June, Prior said, <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plans to introduce a Yugo convertible, complete with a heated, glass rear window and other amenities, in the $ 8,000 range. He hopes that as the cheapest convertible in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it will sell the way its older brother once did.

<HEAD>State Reaches Settlement With Arthur Andersen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has settled its $ 195 million lawsuit against the auditor of bankrupt Home State Savings bank, with the amount to be revealed in a court filing this week. Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> said Friday they had reached an out-of-court settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of Claims Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> ordered both sides to remain silent on the details of the settlement until it was filed with <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Court Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Niehaus </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, former managing partner of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said the proposed settlement `` was substantially less than the cost of the defense,'' but declined to give the amount. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and former superintendent of the department's savings and loans division, had sued <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> to recover some of the $ 275 million in tax money used to protect depositors after Home State collapsed in March 1985. The state claimed <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> partly was responsible for the losses because it was auditor of Home State, which had overinvested funds in <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of Ft.. <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which later collapsd <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s audits did not find anything wrong with Home State's finances or investments <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> maintained it had no way of knowing <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> was a fraudulent operation that had provided Home State and its auditors with phony financial statements. The company also said state officials did not adequately regulate Home State and did not act on warnings about the <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> investments. The proposed settlement, reached Friday in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, must be approved by <PERSON> Niehaus </PERSON>, who is Home State's liquidator. The settlement ended the second of the state's three major Home State-related claims, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Alverson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The state already has negotiated a $ 70 million settlement with <PERSON> Grant-Thornton </PERSON>, formerly known as <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, which was <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>'s accounting firm. A civil suit is pending against former <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, who is appealing his conviction on criminal charges stemming from the thrift's failure. <PERSON> Niehaus </PERSON> has ordered <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 22 million in restitution to the state as part of his criminal sentence.

 A new survey shows the newspaper industry is falling far short of its goal of making minority employment in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the country by the end of the century. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> indicates a slow growth in minority newspaper employees in the past decade. The percentage of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the newsroom is 7.02 percent this year, the survey found, up from 6.56 percent in 1987 and 3.95 percent in 1978, the first year the survey was done. But, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- American-Statesman and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION>'s minorities committee, said last week, `` Such continued improvement is still not enough to meet the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> goal.'' The minority population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the year 2000 is expected to be at least 25 percent. Minorities made up about 20 percent of the population in the 1980 census. In a report to the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> convention, <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said the survey also found that whites still dominate supervisory positions at newspapers, with 95.9 percent of supervisors white and 4.1 percent minorities. Down the ladder, 93.4 percent of copy editors, 92 percent of reporters and 90.7 percent of photographers are white. The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> study also showed that the majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> daily newspapers still have no minority professionals on their staffs, with minority hiring slowest at papers with circulations under 25,000. `` Obviously,'' <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said, `` much needs to be done.'' <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION>, singled out the poor minority-hiring record of small newspapers in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> convention. `` This is deplorable,'' she said, `` And it is a weakness which must be corrected if we are to serve this country as we should.'' The survey's findings also drew criticism from the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,000-member group based in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It's clear to me that whatever they are doing, they're not getting the results we so desperately want,'' said <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>, president of the black journalists group and a columnist for <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The media plays a vital role in society. We shape what people know about our society,'' <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> added. `` And if the media is manned by white men, then the perceptions the public gets will be filtered through those people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> survey is considered the most reliable measure of minority employment at daily newspapers. This year's figures were based on responses from 1,092 newspapers, representing 67 percent of the 1,630 dailies in the country. The responses were projected to the industry as a whole. The group said it did a follow-up study of non-respondents two years ago and found that the projections were accurate within three-tenths of a percentage point. The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> began surveying minority employment in 1978. That was also the year the group adopted the goal of making the percentage of minorities in the newsroom equal to the percentage of minorities in the nation by the year 2000. <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> told the convention that the number of minority employees is not the only measure of a newspaper's commitment to minorities. `` The industry needs to remind itself that this is an issue that goes beyond head count. You have to consider your coverage. ... You have to find a way of making minorities part of the content-making decisions,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union on Monday open early national contract negotiations aimed at healing their recently-bruised relationship and adopting innovations to make <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> more competitive. Negotiators led by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> are attempting to reach a pact to cover 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers whose labor contract expires Sept. 14 The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a two-year duration for the new contract so it will expire with the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pacts in 1990. The two sides will work within a pattern contract established last fall with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The groundbreaking agreements forbid plant closings not announced before labor contract talks begin and prevents layoffs except during production slowdowns caused by poor sales. They also feature six-month joint management-labor studies at each plant to find ways to improve productivity and efficiency, including adoption of so-called team concept worker organization. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON>, a labor and technology expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is counting on such studies to pave the way for company-wide adoption of the so-called Modern Operating Agreements already in effect at six plants. At plants with MOAs, management and labor share all decisions and design the jobs so they can be performed by a team of workers. Each team member learns all tasks involved in the team's assignment. Workers can increase their wages by learning additional jobs, while the cross-training cuts down absenteeism costs because fewer stand-by workers are needed. Teams also inspect their own work, reducing the need for inspectors and for workers who repair the mistakes of others. Some workers and local union leaders steadfastly have resisted adopting MOAs. Most of the six local unions that adopted them were threatened with a plant closing and, in some cases, promised a new plant and more work. Some have resisted successfully. In <LOCATION> Belvidere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, local union leaders refused to accept an MOA despite <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s threat to close the plant, agreeing only to give more flexibility in use of workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in turn put its new <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynasty </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Fifth Avenue front-wheel-drive luxury cars in the plant. `` What <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wants to create is an atmosphere where the MOAs will be more readily accepted and you can do that at the national table,'' <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON> said in an interview Sunday. But, he said, `` it's going to be difficult in the wake of the attempted <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale and the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closing. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s key challenge will be trying to get the national contract out of the way so it can concentrate on the local agreements.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary sparked a bitter, company-wide union backlash that forced it to back down in early March and led to the decision to begin early contract talks. Workers' relationship with the company also suffered from the automaker's decision to close an assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, by year's end, idling 5,500 workers instead of keeping them working at least five more years as originally planned. The two sides will be working without a strike deadline but hope to conclude in June.
