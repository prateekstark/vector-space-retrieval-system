 Heavy snow fell on the central Appalachians during the morning Friday, and high wind blowing out of the desert over southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> fanned brush fires that destroyed homes. Up to 10 inches of snow fell in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, over the Mountain State's southern mountains and over the coal fields near the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border. Up to 10 inches also fell across the mountains of southwestern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a twin-engine airplane carrying 40 pounds of cocaine and $ 7,000 cash crashed into a snowy field outside <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, killing its pilot and its sole passenger. Police said the cocaine was valued at $ 450,000. Authorities said heavy wet snow was falling and the ceiling was down to 400 feet at the time of the crash that killed pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chestnut </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Trotwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, officials said. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with a fuel stop in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> when it apparently lost an engine, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. At least three traffic deaths in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were blamed on slippery roads. Numerous schools were closed in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and power was out to thousands of customers in the state's <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Radford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> counties. `` There's just no way we can count the number of accidents without polling each trooper and seeing how many he investigated,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state police Sgt. G.A. <PERSON> Farthing </PERSON>. `` I'd be hesitant to even give a number.'' <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the Skyline Drive near <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was closed because of heavy snowfall, and some visitors were stranded at visitor centers along the drive. Advisories warned of a chance of snow elsewhere in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Eastern Panhandle. Squalls produced locally heavy snow around the lower <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and heavy snow warnings were issued for northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and for the eastern <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> counties of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Light snow fell around the southern shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. A storm slowly tracking across northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> threatened to produce heavy snow over parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. A winter storm watch was posted into Saturday for the state's central highlands, south-central mountains, and east-central and southeastern plains. A snow advisory was issued for parts of western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Strong, gusty <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> wind continued to blow across southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a third day with gusts to 60 mph reported at <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peak </LOCATION>. More than 20 homes were damaged, some of them destroyed, northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and thousands of people were evacuated. Elsewhere, showers were scattered from northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast, with light rain and drizzle over the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. Afternoon temperatures remained below freezing from northeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> through the Great Lakes region and much of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from zero degrees at International Falls, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to 83 at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Friday morning's official low was 22 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Hibbing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. For Saturday, snow was forecast from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region and the northern half of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> Rain was forecast from southeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and northern and central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Snow also was forecast over parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Scattered showers were forecast from the coast of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, with snow at higher elevations. Highs only in the teens or single digits were predicted from the Dakotas through the Great Lakes to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; in the 20s in the rest of the region from eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> through the upper half of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; above 50 from coastal <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to the southern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast to southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>; above 60 from the central coast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to southwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>; in the 60s and 70s across the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>; and in the 70s in southwestern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Labor Party Votes to Reopen Talks with Likud Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> voted by an overwhelming majority Thursday to re-enter negotiations with the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc on forming a joint national unity government. The decision was a reversal of the party's 110-member Executive Bureau, which last week voted against further talks. It also was seen as a boost to the leadership of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who pushed hard for a vote in favor of new negotiations. `` If this were not the vote, people would say it was a personal defeat, so I suppose it's a personal triumph,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters after the results were announced. The vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was 637 to 348. Just under 1,000 of the committee's more than 1,300 members attended the session in this <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb. Both <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and the party's No. 2 man, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, made emotional pleas in favor of reopening talks with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. They pledged, however, that they would agree to join a coalition government only if it would advance the peace process and was committed to reforming the electoral system. `` For 11 years the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has been in power,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told the committee. `` Almost all that is dear to us has been affected. What should we do? Be proud and go home, or try to find a solution and change the system?'' He added, virtually screaming into the microphone: `` I did not come to arrange negotiations, but to examine our souls.'' Likud first came to power in 1977, and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have governed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in an uneasy coalition since inconclusive elections in 1984. Israeli elections Nov. 1 again ended indecisively, with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> winning 40 seats to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 39. The remaining 41 seats were divided among smaller parties. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to form a new government and needs the support of Labor or several of the smaller parties to achieve a majority in the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset. Intense bargaining has been going on since the election. On Thursday, talks were held between <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a nationalist party with three seats in the new parliament, and a tentative agreement was signed that would give a <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> member the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> portfolio, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> officials also met with three other small parties, but no agreements were reached, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said.

<TEXT>
 Despite the urging of parole officials, Governor <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has refused to grant clemency to <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, a convicted murderer who became a nationally recognized prison editor. `` I wish somebody would tell me what to do, and I'd do it,'' <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday, a day after <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> rejected the state <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendation for a reduction of sentence. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, 47, is serving life in the state prison for a 1961 <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> bank robbery during which he kidnapped three employees, shot and wounded two of them and killed the third by cutting her throat. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> was arrested shortly afterwards and confessed in front of television cameras. He spent 10 years on death row until the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the state's capital punishment law in 1972. The board's second recommendation of reduced sentence would have made <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> eligible for parole. In rejecting it, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> cited the strenuous objections of <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>'s prosecutors and victims. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, who has won numerous national prizes as editor of the prison news magazine The Angolite, said he thinks he was turned down because his success with the magazine has kept him in the limelight. `` We've got a system that encourages anonymity. It encourages prisoners to do nothing, not to distinguish themselves,'' he said. `` If you want to get out of prison, you're supposed to keep your mouth shut and let everybody forget about you,'' he said. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> said he is not sure what to do next. Since the pardon board agreed with him, it would add nothing to get another hearing. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> said he can only hope that <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> will change his mind. `` I would love to meet the man,'' <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> said. `` I wish I could sit down with him. Anything he wants to know, let me present my side.'' Although serving life, <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> is frequently on the road, traveling under guard to lecture at state universities, appear on national television shows and cover state board meetings for the magazine. He and other editors have been singled out for national recognition by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, private foundations and other organizations.

<TEXT>
 Pet shop owner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> says she does n't mind kissing dogs, but she'd rather not perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation again. `` All I thought about was what do I do with the tongue,'' <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> said Tuesday after reviving a greyhound with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>, who runs a pet grooming store, said she had just finished bathing and clipping the toenails of Escape, a 13-year-old retired racer, when the dog collapsed Saturday. She heard a thud and turned to find the dog sprawled out on a pet table, tongue hanging out and eyes rolled back. When she could find no pulse, <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> said she assumed the dog had had a heart attack and began CPR _ a procedure designed to restore normal breathing and heartbeat. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> pressed on the dog's chest and cupped her hands over the dog's mouth to breath air into its lungs. `` After a few minutes, I heard a cough and then a gurgle. I continued working on her until she could breathe on her own,'' said <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>, `` Now it seems funny, doing mouth-to-mouth with a dog. At the time, though, I was only thinking about how to keep the dog alive,'' she said. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> said she took a CPR course after a friend developed heart problems, and it was the first time she put her training to use. The dog, owned by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Acushnet </LOCATION>, is recovering at home and is being treated with nitroglycerin, <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> said. Tests showed Escape's heart suffered some damage, she said. Escape's veterinarian, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairhaven </LOCATION>, said it is difficult to say whether Ms. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>' actions saved the dog's life or whether the heart resumed beating on its own. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> called Ms. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>' response admirable but cautioned against untrained people performing CPR on animals. He said the best thing to do is call an animal hospital.

<HEAD>Jerry Lee Lewis Has Little Left, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rock' n' roller <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, facing a $ 2 million tax debt and other bills, has few personal possessions he could use to pay off creditors, a bankruptcy lawyer says. `` There's not much left,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagemeyer </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in federal <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, said Thursday. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 53, filed for bankruptcy Nov. 8, citing debts of more than $ 3 million and income of about $ 5,000 a month, <ORGANIZATION> Hagemeyer </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been squabbling with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> since 1975, and tax agents have seized cars, furniture and other property from him several times over the years. `` There have been at least two sales by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> that I know of,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hagemeyer </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' bankruptcy petition lists a residence valued at $ 30,000 near <LOCATION> Nesbit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and other personal property worth about $ 6,000. In a hearing Wednesday, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the income from an upcoming movie based on his life would fall well short of his debts. Responding to inquiries from bankruptcy trustee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said a contract he signed eight years ago puts his income from the movie at $ 200,000 to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> asked if <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> expected to perform any consulting work or other moneymaking activities for the producers of `` Great Balls of Fire'' starring <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>. `` No sir,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` I've suggested some things. We do n't see eye to eye on some things They're pretty well set on what they want to do.'' The movie about <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' tumultuous personal life and the early years of his rock' n' roll career is being shot in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. In is petition, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> listed 22 creditors, but his major debts are to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> concert promoter who sued in 1978 after the rocker failed to show up for a scheduled performance, <ORGANIZATION> Hagemeyer </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> failed to show up to oppose the lawsuit and a judgment was filed against him for more than $ 450,000. With interest, he now owes about $ 950,000, the attorney said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> went to trial on tax evasion charges in 1984, but was acquitted of charges he intentionally hid money from the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said he owed the government more than $ 650,000. The singer's income comes primarily from performances, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on matters other than the bankruptcy petition. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who recorded such early rock' n' roll classics as `` Whole <PERSON> Lotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakin </PERSON>' Going On'' and `` Great Balls of Fire,'' told the bankruptcy trustee he has not received any record royalties in the last few years.

<HEAD>East Germany Launches Censorship Drive Against Soviet Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, once the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s staunchest ideological ally, has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of censorship aimed at bridling the spread of the Kremlin's new reform policies. The seriousness of the campaign became clear Nov. 20 when <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist government slapped a first-ever, open-ended ban on a Soviet publication, a magazine called Sputnik. The campaign has pitted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aging and conservative leaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whose re-examinations of Soviet history have led to a public debate on a scale unheard of in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. East German leaders have long resisted President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, and other reforms, on grounds that such critical discussions of problems in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unnecessary. Recent speeches by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have reiterated the government's rejection of the Soviet reforms course. However, the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yet by the government to distance itself from the debate in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and to insulate the nation's population from the popular changes. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies enjoy enormous support among East Germans who hope his influence will bring about change in one of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most tightly controlled societies. East German party leaders have occasionally blocked the distribution of newspapers from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact neighbors in the past _ during the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the early periods of labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Selected issues of Soviet magazines have also been blocked. But until the decision on the monthly magazine Sputnik, no outright ban had ever been imposed on a Soviet magazine. The decision was followed quickly with an order removing five Soviet films dealing with Stalinist themes from theaters across the country. Authorities also canceled an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> cabaret production that poked fun at the government's reluctance to accept <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies The banning of Sputnik followed its publication of articles critical of the late <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communists before <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> took power in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1933. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who died in 1953, holds a special place in official <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a liberator in World War II and as the Soviet leader who helped found the new communist nation in 1949. East German leaders were outraged over an article in Sputnik's October issue that suggested that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> `` had been a mere puppet of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'' after the two nation's signed a mutual non-aggression pact in 1939 and that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communists had indirectly aided <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power by not `` joining together with Social Democrats'' to stop The Sputnik article also charged that German communists followed `` Stalin's order to stop all anti-fascist propaganda'' after the pact was signed. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1941. Distribution of the October Sputnik was ordered halted shortly after it appeared in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` These -LRB- historical -RRB- issues go to the very root of their -LRB- communist East German leaders' -RRB- existence,'' said <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>, a prominent East German author, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` These -LRB- articles -RRB- upset the picture of the world they want to depict.' <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, along with a substantial number of the nation's ruling Politburo members were members of the prewar German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and pride themselves on having fought fascism. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was imprisoned by the Nazis and thousands of communists were slain. Shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at the time have not been a matter for debate in the East German media. In an article defending the Sputnik ban, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organ Neues Deutschland charged that the publication `` not only distorts Soviet history, but the history of the German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The magazine, and we say this openly, defames German communists.'' While carefully emphazing that Sputnik was `` not an official organ'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutchland </PERSON> added that `` distorted visions of Soviet history, distributed here, are incompatible with our friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Soviet officials defended the magazine, saying it `` mirrors a plurality of opinion in the Soviet press.''

 Marxist guerrillas called the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting for 13 years for independence of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, near where two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AID planes came under missile attack on Thursday. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> occupied most of the former <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> in 1976 after claiming it as Moroccan since early in the century. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> immediately recognized the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s struggle for independence, and about 70 nations, mostly members of the non-aligned group, followed suit. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> occupied the southernmost third of the territory in 1976 but gave up its claim to the area in 1979 and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> annexed it. The Polisario, with extensive help from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, waged an aggressive guerrilla war. With a heavily armed guerrilla force of 20,000 men, Polisario almost captured the Mauritanian capital, <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>, in 1976, disrupted phosphate mining at the Sahara mining center of <PERSON> Bou </PERSON> <PERSON> Craa </PERSON> and attacked shipping off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast with heavily armed rubber boats. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> deployed virtually its entire 120,000-member army and guerrilla activity nearly came to a halt. But the operation was expensive in money and lives, and by 1986 <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> had lost about 15,000 men _ matched by losses on the Polisario side. This year <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION>'s main foreign backers _ decided it had more to gain by reaching a direct understanding with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has been mediating peace talks between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the guerrillas. Under a tentative agreement, about 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers would monitor a referendum that would result in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>'s independence or affiliation with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>

 Holiday chimes may sound a somber note for families grieving over the loss of a child, but a psychiatrist suggests survivors start new traditions in memory of the departed. `` Families in mourning have to be told it is all right to have fun,'' says <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, writing in the December issue of American Journal of Diseases of Children. `` Laughter is the best medicine for helping the bereaved cope with their loss. Having a good time does not mean that the parents loved their child any less,'' she said. `` In fact, they may be showing more love because by enjoying themselves, they are bringing their family closer together.'' In getting through the holidays, families must decide what is comfortable, Ms. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> said. `` Changes can make things less painful,'' she said. `` A different tree with different decorations. Opening the presents at a different time. A different menu for dinner.'' Some families put a small Christmas tree on the child's grave, Ms. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> said. Others light a candle or order special plants or flowers. Accompanying her article are some `` do's'' and `` do n't's'' for those spending time with bereaved parents during the holidays. Do: _ Talk about special qualities of the child they have lost. _ Allow them to express as much grief as they are feeling. _ Reassure them that they did everything they could. _ Pay attention to surviving siblings. But do n't: _ Say you know how they feel unless you have lost a child. _ Say the parents should be over the loss. _ Change the subject when they mention their dead child. _ Say they can always have other children. _ Point out that at least they have other children. Ms. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, a child psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, says religion can be a source of comfort, but she cautions that surviving children might misinterpret some explanations. In one case, she said, the behavior of a 4-year-old boy was poor after his brother's death. `` When asked about this behavior change for the worse, he replied that he was not going to be so good that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would want him. This child had been told that his brother was so wonderful that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> wanted him to live with him in heaven,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> said. The Compassionate Friends, an international organization dedicated to helping parents overcome the loss of a child, recently sent out holiday suggestions to its 600 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chapters. `` Sometimes the toughest part of all is the anticipation,'' said <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>, director of group's national office in suburban <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. `` You turn on the television and people are telling you to get the shopping done. It's all around us,'' she said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` Some people like to buy a gift that their child would have liked, and then give it to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or a church group.'' Other suggestions include urging families to change their holiday routines, mention the loss of their children in Christmas cards and discuss them when they feel comfortable with the subject. Mrs. <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>, whose 14-year-old daughter was killed by a car in 1971, says the first holiday without a child is the hardest. `` When a child dies, our priorities get shook up. We want to show a little more love,'' she said. `` I think people just need to be gentle with themselves. That's the main thing.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a twilight assessment, says <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has never shown any reason to be mistrusted and in fact is steering the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> away from its old goal of `` a one-world communist state.'' In what was probably his final White House news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` trust but verify'' remains his byword in dealing with the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, but he offered an optimstic assessment of how U.S.-Soviet relations stand at the end of his eight-year tenure in office. `` The path remains open and the pace of peace continues,'' he said. For half an hour, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fielded questions Thursday night in an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> decorated with Christmas trees hung with silver tinsel. He said it was the Russians _ not he _ who have changed, but his old anti-communist fire was dampened. On a pressing domestic issue, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would be `` deeply disappointed'' if President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after assuming office next month, raised taxes to help cut the deficit, which grew to $ 155 billion this year. But he quickly added, `` I do n't think it's going to happen.'' The chief executive also told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ultimately will have to negotiate with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to win release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We would be ready to talk with them,'' he said of the Iranians. In addition, he said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> did not go far enough in saying his organization accepts the existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a state and condemns terrorism in all forms. `` He has left openings for himself where he can deny that he meant this or meant that, that sounded so clean-cut,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. On a day after his fifth and final meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened the meeting with reporters by reading a warm statement on the state of superpower relations. Asked if he believed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was trying to make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a less threatening nation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied without hesitation, `` Yes, I do. `` And I think he recognizes that their massive buildup has been responsible for the great economic crisis that he faces there in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Asked point-blank if he trusted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` He has n't shown me any reason yet that I should n't.'' However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the motto `` trust but verify'' is one that properly guides Soviet policy, too, and said he did not think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` would gamble on believing that he should n't protect his own interests, also.'' Whether or not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ever become allies, as they were during World War II, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it was entirely up to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. It could happen, he said, `` if it can be definitely established that they no longer are following the expansionist policy that was instituted in the communist revolution that their goal must be a one-world communist state.'' The president said `` certainly there are indications'' the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is moving that way. `` I do think that there is evidence that they do n't like being the pariah, that they might want to join the family of nations and join them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace.'' He said he would like to see that happen. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed cool to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for a ceasefire in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, followed by a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> peacekeeping force and broad-based government. `` I'm not sure the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> would like that or that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to do such a thing,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Moreover, he said it would be unacceptable to stop arming the Afghan rebels unless the Soviet-backed regime ended military operations. The president said he was `` very grateful'' for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement of a 500,000 cutback in Soviet troop strength but said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> still would have superiority in conventional weapons <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also expressed confidence that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believed as he does that Contra forces fighting the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are freedom fighters and worthy of continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. On the subject of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ultimately would have to negotiate with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> because the Iranians control the kidnappers. Concerning that prospect, he said, `` There are conditions that have to be met also there. Anytime that they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them.'' `` We can not enter into negotiating in the sense of what kind of ransom to pay or you're just encouraging more hostage-taking. But there are other channels,'' he said. Later, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> elaborated: `` We'll be glad to talk, but we've never been able to get them to do that.'' Reflecting on the highs and lows of his presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his `` greatest burden'' was to have to order troops into `` danger ... to where their lives are threatened, to where their lives are taken.'' He later expanded that, noting the continued captivity of hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. His greatest joy, he said without hesitation, was the economic recovery _ the longest ever during peacetime. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to say the news conference was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last one, but <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it was.

<TEXT>
 Taking office nearly eight years ago, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the leaders of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> themselves had said they would `` commit any crime'' to achieve world domination. Now he's inviting <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to come visit him in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> With <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fresh from his fifth meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in less than four years, it was inevitable that a reporter at what may be his last <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news conference would remind him of what he said about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership at his first one. On Jan. 29, 1981, just nine days after he was inaugurated, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters, `` I know of no leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the revolution, and including the present leadership, that has not more than once repeated ... their determination that their goal must be the promotion of world revolution.'' Furthermore, he said, the Soviet leaders `` have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that ... `` Thursday night, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s words were different. `` That was four leaders back before this one,'' he said. `` I think there have been some changes.'' Asked directly whether he trusted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president said, `` He has n't shown me any reason yet why I should n't.'' Quickly he added, as he so often does, that his motto is `` trust everybody, but cut the cards.'' His remarks were sprinkled, however, with complimentary references to the Soviet leader. At the end of his private meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> handed the Soviet leader a photograph with the inscription that they had `` walked a long way together to clear a path for peace.'' `` And so we have,'' he told the news conference. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never met as president with any of the three other Soviet leaders who held office and died during his administration _ <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>. But he has met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in 1986, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987 and both in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and on Governors Island in 1988. He seemed eager to keep in touch, saying the Soviet leader had invited the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> had reciprocated with an invitation to the Gorbachevs to visit <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The outgoing president and his wife will live in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after his term ends Jan. 20, and say they will also spend time at their ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> mountains north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has never been to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In the course of superpower summitry during his second term, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, there has been a `` serious movement and even some breakthroughs.'' He applauded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer to reduce Soviet troop strength by half a million troops, but said there was `` still room for negotiations'' on the subject because the Soviets would retain an advantage in troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The path remains open and the pace of peace continues,'' the president said. Asked whether he believed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was transforming the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into a less threatening nation, he replied, `` Yes, I do.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hasty return home, prompted by the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, was `` a sad final note to what has been an otherwise successful _ and I use the next words advisedly _ happy and historic visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Asked to assess <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s long-term chances for political survival, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Well, I realize, and I think we all should, that he is battling a bureaucracy, because whether it's a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> bureaucracy or one of our own, the first rule of bureaucracy is protect the bureaucracy.'' `` And it would mean some great changes for some of the `` Nomenklatura,'' as they call their bureaucracy there, if he institutes the reforms that he's talking about,'' he continued. `` But, on the plus side for him, it's very evident that the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are on his side. And I have to believe that the Nomenklatura is going to have to think twice with regard to how far they would go in trying to block him when the man in the street over there wants the things that have been seen.'' __ greater than EDITOR'S NOTE: <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> covers the White House for The Associated Press

<HEAD>SOVIET UNION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` extraordinary things'' have occurred in recent years to improve U.S.-Soviet relations. But he added that the Soviets would retain conventional troop superiority even if <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> makes planned troop reductions. The president said he believed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was trying to make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> less threatening. Asked whether he trusted the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, he replied, `` He has n't shown me any reason yet that I should n't.'' But he quickly reasserted his policy of `` trust but verify.'' He said he would someday like to see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as allies `` if it can be definitely established they no longer follow expansionist policy.''

 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rejected an assertion that tax cuts he sponsored had contributed to the federal budget deficit. He blamed anew congressional spending habits, specifically those of the Democrats, for the red ink. `` We came in inheriting literally deficit spending built into the structure of government,'' the president.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would be `` deeply disappointed'' if President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to raise taxes after taking office, adding `` I do n't think it's going to happen. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could trim the deficit without raising taxes or cutting Social Security.

<HEAD>A LOOK BACK</HEAD>

 His hardest job as president: `` I do n't think there is anything tougher than to have to order the young men and women in our military today ... to have to send them into danger, order them into some place where their lives are threatened, where their lives can be taken.'' He said the economic recovery was the best part of his presidency.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AFGHANISTAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not unilaterally halt aid to the U.S.-backed rebels seeking to overthrow the Soviet-sponsored <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. He called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> an `` exceptional'' proposal but said he was not certain the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> would endorse it. The president said the `` puppet government'' would have to step down for lasting resolution of civil strife.

 The president said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` left openings for himself'' to back away from his statement this week of support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated that the <LOCATION> Unted </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would enter into dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief only `` once it is clear-cut that he's ready to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a nation.''

 Reflecting on the peaks and valleys of his presidency, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his toughest burden has been sending young Americans into battle and laboring to win the release of others held hostage. At two different points in his nationally broadcast news conference Thursday night, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> talked of difficult moments in the Oval Office. Asked what task he had found most difficult, the president quickly cited the sending of troops into combat. Saying that `` I think I am prouder of them than of anything that has happened'' during his nearly eight years in office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added: `` I do n't think there's anything tougher than to have to order these magnificent young men and women in our military ... into danger.'' `` That's got to be something that any president would hesitate on and have to say was the greatest burden,'' he said. At another point, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited the continuing captivity of nine Americans held by pro-Iranian elements in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, saying it was `` one of those things ... you go to bed with every night.'' During <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, more than 200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were killed during a bombing of a Marine barracks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, several thousand troops were sent into combat during the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, in which 19 American soldiers were killed, and 37 crewmen aboard the USS Stark were killed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> when their ship was struck by missiles fired by an Iraqi fighter. When asked what he most enjoyed about the presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied that `` there are a number of things to miss.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` let me simply say one I enjoyed the most is the economic recovery.'' `` When I came here, for almost half a century, the debate on the -LRB- Capitol -RRB- <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had always been between more big spending programs, more power for the federal government, more intervention in private affairs by the federal government, as against those who were preaching less,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 On a return to his home state, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> visited the only precinct that he did n't carry in November's election. Judging by the reception, he might win even its votes the next time around. The tiny <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> was filled with half again as many adults as voted in the race. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> lost there, 18-12, but won in the other 672 precincts, capturing 81 percent of the statewide vote. `` I wanted to head up here and find out what I was doing wrong,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told the gathering in this outpost of rural eastern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who followed up his election victory by winning the three-way majority leader's race last week, had written letters to <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> residents inviting them to the meeting. He was applauded repeatedly inside the church, a white wooden building surrounded by a mustard-seed farm, and several people told him they looked forward to seeing him running for president. `` Boy, you'd never know I only got 12 votes, for all that told me they voted for me,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Local citizens said they held nothing against the senator, a Democrat, but that his challenger, Republican <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, was more in tune with the Pentecostal community's beliefs, especially on abortion. <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> is the director of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` Abortion was the issue here,'' said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON>, the pastor who welcomed <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Rev. Coffin, in her introduction, reminded <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> that the success of majority rule in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the ability to listen to the minority. `` Thank you for listening to a very small minority here,'' she told him. The toughest questions for <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Talmadge </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>. He attacked <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others who do n't oppose abortion in all instances as being in the same league as `` pimps, prostitutes and witches.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he opposes federal funding for abortion but was not against the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling which gives women the choice. He told <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> it was `` regrettable'' that he was associating people of different viewpoints with scurrilous characters. The senator explained that he is a Roman Catholic but, `` I do n't know when life begins. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> fielded questions on local issues and the U.S.-Canada free-trade pact, which he opposed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and afterward joined the congregation for sandwiches and sweets in a basement social hall. Some of the people apologized for <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>'s attack, explaining that he was not a native of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> himself allowed that he was impressed by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s visit. `` He comes here, exposing his flank,'' said <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>, `` He's quite a guy.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> chatted with <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>, reporting afterward that another facet of the encounter had been revealed. `` He said, ` I was a private and I always wanted to get an officer. This was my chance','' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who was an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counterintelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1950s, said with a laugh. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said another, older man came up and said, `` Boy, I've had a lot of politicians come around before the election, but you're the first one to come around after the election

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s alma mater, tiny <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, is sifting through a bonanza of presidential baubles, including the trademark jellybean jar and a cowboy belt buckle proclaiming `` the buckaroo stops here.'' `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has a deep affection for <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and remains consistently in touch with us,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearne </PERSON>, the college's president. The school of 460 students about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Peoriairport </LOCATION> news conference, saying the quake, which registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, `` had extremely grave consequences, devastation and grave loss of life.'' Armenian church officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who are in contact with people in the region said the death toll may be as high as 70,000. Although he had only `` one working day'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` I and my delegation believe that this was a very important day.'' The highlights of the visit were <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that he planned a major reduction in Soviet troop strength over the next three years, and his superpower luncheon with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first Soviet chief to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 28 years, said his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech and a later reception gave him the opportunity to `` set out our views ... on the world today, and on the prospects of the world's development.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called the Governors Island session with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a good meeting, held in ... an open and trusting atmosphere.'' He said the one word he would use to characterize it was `` continuity'' and said all parties walked away, `` confident that our relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation, on the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later added, `` I think I would be remiss in my duty if I went home without saying how much we are grateful to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION>, for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they have been expressing over these days.

<HEAD>Attractive New `Aida' At Met</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will stand for PMs.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attractive new production of `` Aida'' at the Metropolitan Opera avoids the visual silliness of the two productions that arrived before it. This one makes dramatic use of the stage elevator to change sets. The opening night of the new `` Aida,'' a Met Opera Guild benefit, was tastefully conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and gloriously sung by <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> as <PERSON> Aida </PERSON>, <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> as Radames, <PERSON> Fiorenza </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossotto </PERSON> as <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON> as <PERSON> Aida </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Amonasro </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Plishka </PERSON> as the high priest. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> sounded sterling throughout. He surprised this listener by taking the optional lower ending, not the high C, at the end of `` Celeste Aida.'' Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, singing her first <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> at the Met, bloomed into full vocal glory in the third act. She had longing in her voice in `` O patria mia'' and some beautiful pianissimos. Her voice has matured marvelously and still has youthful freshness. In many operas, the love music is in the first act, before things start to go wrong. In `` Aida'' the love music is in Act 4, after things have gone so wrong that <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> and Radames are sealed in a vault to die. Their duet was so beautiful that the audience did n't immediately break the spell with huge applause at the end of it Miss Cossotto, who made her Met debut as <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON> in 1968, is a fine musician, using her voice to brilliant advantage. Her stage personality, while not flamboyant, is striking, placing <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON>' royal but hopeless love for Radames in the foreground in the first two acts Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s more retiring demeanor put Aida in the background. <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON> was in brilliant voice and form. Amonasro may be a captive but he's full of vitality and vibrant with plans. <PERSON> Plishka </PERSON> sang with admirable authority. The costumes, by <PERSON> Dada </PERSON> <PERSON> Saligeri </PERSON>, were mostly white trimmed with gold. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> began, a hero, in all gold, and ended, disgraced, in a dark striped tunic. Some scenes were played near the front of the stage, in front of a wall with huge bas reliefs of two seated Egyptians. Then this would lift for a scene using more of the stage. The most dramatic theatrical stroke is having Amneris' room in Act 2 sink out of sight. First, soldiers are seen standing on top of the set that's descending, then a platform for the king and <PERSON> Amneris </PERSON> is revealed, then all the citizenry _ now joined at ground level by the soldiers _ wait for the triumphal entry scene. In the final scene, the elevator is used again, so the audience sees <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> and Radames in the vault and Amneris in a temple above them. There is no silly dance in Act 1 while Radames receives his armor and no fight to the death during the triumphal entry scene. There is a dance there, by choreographer <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, making his Met debut, but it is n't silly. <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaranta </PERSON>, who is Italian and won an Academy Award in 1987 for art direction for `` A Room with a View,'' designed the sets. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisell </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who was on the staff of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> for 15 years, did stage direction. Both, making Met debuts, proved to be stars of the show.

<HEAD>A-10 Warplane Has One of Best Safety Records In Air Force Fleet</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Germany Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane that crashed into an apartment building in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, killing four people, has one of the best safety records in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inventory. The A-10 Thunderbolt II is an older model ground-attack plane designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the crash was the 14th serious, so-called Class A accident since Oct. 1, when the current fiscal year began, although it was the first involving an A-10. At the same point in the last fiscal year, the service had experienced nine Class A accidents. Among the 14 accidents recorded since Oct. 1 have been two involving the new B-1B bomber; one involving a B-52 bomber, and one involving an F-16 fighter in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> last Monday that killed the general in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says it is impossible to predict what type of safety record it will post for the year based on little more than one month's passage. During fiscal 1988, for example, the service experienced a grim record for its F-16 jet fighter, and yet finished the year by posting one of its best overall safety records in history. `` Nonetheless, it is true that our mishap rate has suddenly spiked up and we do n't know why,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be identified. `` We continue to examine our training procedures, maintenance and everything else.'' Wednesday's crash involved an A-10 on a training flight that inexplicably slammed into an apartment building in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, killing at least four people, injuring dozens of others and destroying homes for more than a block. The A-10 is designed to support soldiers on the ground by attacking enemy tanks and other high-priority targets. The Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has more than 700 of them in its inventory. Statistically, the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter or attack plane currently in the inventory. The aircraft has chalked up a major accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than 1.75 million flight hours. A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage exceeding $ 500,000 to an aircraft. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lost three A-10's, for a mishap rate of 1.37 per 100,000 flight hours. By comparison, the A-7 had a mishap rate of 6.04 per 100,000 flight hours; the F-16 a rate of 6.80 per 100,000 flight hours, and the B-52 a rate of 2.04 per 100,000 flight hours. The overall <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> rate for the last fiscal year was 1.63 serious mishaps per 100,000 flying hours _ representing 55 total accidents _ just slightly worse than the service's all-time best of 1.53 set in fiscal 1986. The surge in <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> accidents over the past month comes at a time when the other military services continue to report stable rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, for example, which enjoyed its safest year ever in fiscal 1988, is on track toward an even safer year. Since Oct. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has experienced only four Class A accidents. It recorded 37 in all of fiscal 1988, or more than three per month on average.

<HEAD>Survey: Tax Changes Taking Bigger Corporate Bite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new survey shows that overhaul of the federal income tax is increasing the bite on corporations _ which is just what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended. One thousand corporations surveyed by Tax Analysts paid about $ 7 billion more into the federal treasury last year than they did in 1986, when the tax laws underwent major revisions. The 1,000 companies, spread out among 49 industries, paid an average of 24.72 percent of their earnings in federal income tax in 1987, the study found. That compares with 21.54 percent in 1986 and 20.94 percent the previous year. Three out of four corporations paid a higher rate last year than the year before. While a portion of the increase is due to higher earnings in 1987, most is attributable to the new tax law, said Tax Analysts, a Virginia-based research and publishing organization. `` Tax reform is working,'' said <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovelli </PERSON> of Tax Analysts. `` More corporations are paying higher taxes. Fewer are avoiding taxes.'' A major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul was to shift a greater portion of the tax burden from individuals to corporations. Over five years, the total shift is expected to be about $ 125 billion. The most significant corporate changes enacted were repeal of the special treatment of capital gains, toughening of the alternative minimum tax, repeal of the investment tax credit and restructuring of depreciation allowances. The general corporate tax rate was cut, from 46 percent to 33 percent, which benefited all companies. However, because different types of corporations took advantage of different provisions under the old tax law, there are significant variations in how they are faring under the new law, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Starcher </PERSON> of Tax Analysts. For example, a reduction in long-term accounting provisions more than doubled the average tax rate paid by aerospace companies, from 15.6 percent of earnings to 36.7 percent, the study found. On the other hand, apparel and furniture companies are paying generally lower taxes because they have the lower tax rates but lost relatively little in the other tax changes. According to the Tax Analysts calculations, the automobile industry paid the lowest tax rate last year _ a negative 6.93 percent _ while construction was highest at 58.9 percent. Both situations were exaggerated by special circumstancs, <PERSON> Marovelli </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, had a one-time tax writeoff that made the entire industry's situation look worse than it was; without <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marovelli </PERSON> said, the industry would have paid 17 percent. The high rate on the construction industry reflected the same accounting changes that affected the aerospace industry, as well as a curtailment in use of installment sales, which in the past had produced a tax savings for that industry. Other industry figures from 1987 included: insurance, 14 percent; paper, 19 percent; drugs, 22.1 percent; banking, 23.6 percent; railroads, 23.9 percent; petroleum refining, 24.9 percent; lumber, 29.2 percent; textiles, 29.4 percent; services, 31.7 percent; tobacco, 33.1 percent; apparel, 34.9 percent; commercial printing, 35 percent; newspapers, 36.7 percent; and retail groceries, 37.1 percent. Tax Analysts bases its calculations on corporate filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a labor-financed tax research group, reached similar conclusions in a study of profitable corporations released in September. That study concluded the number of profitable companies that paid no federal tax was cut by more than half last year _ to 16 _ and that the 250 companies surveyed paid an average of 22.1 percent.

<HEAD>Man Holds Police Hostage With Two Pieces of Beef Jerky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prisoner being taken to a mental hospital used two pieces of beef jerky shaped like a gun muzzle to hold a police chief hostage for about 40 minutes before he was subdued while praying, authorities said. `` He was pretty cunning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON> said Thursday after the ordeal. `` It felt like a real gun.'' Rains said he was taken hostage by the prisoner, who had once been treated as a manic-depressive at the <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, Wednesday night in the bathroom of an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> service station. Rains and <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> had stopped at the service station on their way to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the 58-year-old prisoner was being committed at the request of relatives. However, the prisoner, who was not handcuffed, got into an armlock with Rains in the gas station bathroom. `` He was trying to grab my gun, and he told me he had a derringer in my back,'' Rains said. But the .22 - caliber derringer the man claimed to be holding turned out to be two rounded pieces of beef jerky, one on top of the other to simulate a double barrel, covered with a bread wrapper, Rains At first, Rains said, he did n't believe the prisoner had a gun. But then, he said, `` I felt something else in his hand. I could n't tell what it was. The man, who works as a truck driver, is a gun enthusiast and does own a derringer, Rains said. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> rushed to assist Rains after his call for help but was held at bay by the prisoner, who stood behind the police chief. `` We just simply did n't know for sure, and it was n't the time to take a gamble,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. While <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> and Rains attempted to calm the prisoner, an <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hostage negotiator and special mission team were called to surround the bathroom. The man, who was not identified by police, attempted during the 40-minute standoff to convince the officers he did not need to go to the state hospital. `` He was trying to convince us that <PERSON> God </PERSON> was going to cure his mental illness,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> and two <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> officers finally subdued the man after he dropped to his knees and began praying. No charges had been filed Thursday against the prisoner, who was transported to the state hospital after surrendering, an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> police spokesman said. Rains said he may ask <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON> to file charges against the man. `` Had he had a real gun, he probably would have shot me in the back,'' Rains said.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-10 fighter crashed Thursday afternoon near the heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, but the pilot ejected safely, officials said. The plane, based at at <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, crashed around 3:30 p.m. about 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>.

Another A-10 crashed Thursday into an apartment house in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, killing at least four people. Despite the coincidence of the accidents, Ms. <PERSON> Keck </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would not ground the base's A-10s. The Tactical Air Command late Thursday released a statement saying that the aircraft would not be grounded. `` I can tell you from this standpoint, we're not tying the two of them together,'' said the civilian spokeswoman. Officials said an investigative board left for the reservation, whose residents have complained for years about low-flying military aircraft. The pilot was the only occupant of the single-passenger jet, a unit of the 23rd Tactical Support Group, Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Besich </PERSON> said. He said the aircraft was on a training mission. Ms. <PERSON> Keck </PERSON> said the jet crashed near the town of <LOCATION> Tracy </LOCATION>, about 20 miles northwest of the tribal capital of Sells. Reservation residents have complained for years about low-altitude flights from the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> base, which flies many training missions over sparsely populated southwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. No one answered the telephone in Tohono O'Odham tribal offices in several attempts to reach the tribe for comment.

<HEAD>A Long List Of Potential Agriculture Secretaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The name of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> is among the latest to surface on a long list of candidates to be secretary of agriculture in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, according to some farm organization officials. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, once a favorite in the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> guessing game, has indicated he will return to the private sector when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next month. Because of that decision, there does not appear to be a front-runner for the agriculture post. According to one source who demanded anonymity, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> may have changed his mind after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> as White House trade representative. She is a veteran <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider but has little hands-on agricultural experience. But the source said Thursday that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> might be persuaded to take the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and help with agriculture-related issues during difficult times still ahead in multinational trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said he sees no clear favorite among the dozen or so names that have been mentioned for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> post. `` I think the bag is so full now there is n't any more room for new names,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Among those believed to be in the running are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farmer and former federation president, and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, its current chief. Asked about the possibility <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might name a woman to head the department, which traditionally has had men in all but a few senior positions, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said he had heard <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> mentioned as a candidate. `` It would certainly be a very interesting appointment,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` In the eyes of some people, it might even be revolutionary. Personally, I think it would be refreshing, but I'm not sure it's the time or place. I do n't know.'' A second <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Republican, Rep. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, also has been mentioned for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> post. A seven-term veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee for agriculture. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> here, said she had not heard either woman mentioned for the job but added, `` We could do a lot worse than either <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> or <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, that's for sure.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said she thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice would be `` someone who listens to his boss'' and follows the path set by the 1985 farm law and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy calling for reduced federal support for farmers and subsidies for commodity exports at levels below the cost of production for family farmers. Some of those contacted Thursday said <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> farmer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, the current deputy secretary to outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, has come on strong recently as a potential successor to <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and has been gaining support among some Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, has been in the running too, along with former <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> soybean farmer. The list also includes Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, a conservative <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who gave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a helping hand in some of his early congressional budget battles. Another recent addition to the speculation is <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s board of governors. <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, a Kansan, has a long background in banking and family agriculture. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, said her favorite would be <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> because of what she termed his `` very strong consumer record.'' But she added: `` The direction this -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- administration will go is not likely to be pro-consumer. From the trend of the appointments so far, probably it will be more centrist.'' Environmental and conservation advocates are sitting well no matter who <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> puts in charge of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, policy director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he would like to see <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> get promoted to the top job because of his record during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years as a supporter of sound conservation policies, including the Conservation Reserve Program established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law. That program's goal is to take up to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland from production by 1990 and protect it for 10 years by planting grass and trees. More than half the goal has been met. But <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he expected the program will be continued regardless of whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> taps to head the department.

<HEAD>Report: Safety Not Considered When Coast Guard Shut Ship Traffic
Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, in deciding to close two of its largest ship-traffic control centers, failed to consider safety and environmental factors and incorrectly estimated the cost savings, a government study has concluded. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said economics was the main reason for closing the facilities, known as vessel traffic services, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> harbors. Yet because of incomplete recordkeeping, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was not sure how much money it actually would save. `` Because the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> did not consider such information, it does not know if it made the correct decision in closing the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> -LRB- facilities -RRB-, two of the three largest in terms of vessel activity,'' said the report. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the closings will save about $ 3.5 million _ mainly due to lower personnel costs. That is $ 228,000 more than the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> itself had estimated. The ship-traffic control facilities are similar to air traffic control systems. They use a combination of radar, radio and closed-circuit cameras to monitor vessel traffic in waters where the possibility of accidents is high. The cuts were part of a plan to pare 1,060 military and civilian jobs nationwide in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and save the government about $ 48 million. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> facilities on Governors Island was closed last July while <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' was decommissioned in March. The Coast Guard chose <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> because they would take less time to close and because it `` believed it could close the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> VTS's with a minimum of -LRB- public -RRB- resistance,'' the report said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is the nation's busiest harbor, handling more than 212,000 vessels in fiscal 1987, while <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the third busiest, with traffic of about 157,000 vessels in the same period. The report criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> for failing to consider a number of relevant factors in the closings, including `` prevention of accidents and fatalities and protection of the environment through prevention of oil spills and accidents involving hazardous cargoes.'' Although it took issue with the methods used by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in reaching the closure decision, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> did not specifically say the closures were a mistake.

<HEAD>Jewish Group, Congressmen Criticize US Decision On Soviet Emigres</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Jewish group and a congressman say a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision to allow some Soviet Jews into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under parole status rather than as refugees sends the wrong signal to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Another Jewish organization, however, said Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision Thursday to grant parole status to as many as 2,000 Soviet emigres a month is a welcome step. In order to receive refugee status, a person has to show a well-founded fear of persecution. Granting parole instead of refugee status `` sends an incorrect message that Jews are not being persecuted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s immigration subcommittee. `` By denying refugee status to Soviet Jews, it's prematurely sending a signal that the situation of Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has so changed that they're not being persecuted, and that just is n't so,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Zukerman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Zukerman </PERSON> said those rejected for refugee status are subjected to persecution that is `` indistinguishable from those accepted'' into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last summer stopped granting automatic political refugee status to Soviet Jews and other Soviet citizens. It said budget concerns were largely responsible for the change. Those paroled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must pay their own way, while transportation and resettlement costs for refugees are paid in part by the government. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> that it will have about $ 27 million available during fiscal 1989 to pay for transporting only 12,000 Soviet Jews, said <PERSON> Zukerman </PERSON>. Being paroled into the country is less desirable than being a refugee because it does n't entitle an immigrant to become a legal resident or to seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. Jewish organizations say 173 Soviet Jews have been denied refugee status by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> since September. The organizations also say a growing number of other Jews seeking visas from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have been told to expect delays of a year or more. To relieve some of the pressure, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would parole up to 2,000 Soviet emigres a month into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also ordered <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> to temporarily transfer a Russian-speaking <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officer to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to handle refugee applications, rather than waiting until early January when the quarterly process normally begins. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s announcement and especially his order to resume processing refugees in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` is a welcome signal,'' said a statement issued by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. `` Protests concerning the recent treatment of Soviet Jews'' by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> `` are finally being addressed.'' The group said, however, that `` without further clarification ... his response is inadequate. ... granting parole status ... ignores <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights policy and the long history of Soviet anti-Semitic repression of Jews.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also said he has asked `` as part of a longer-term solution'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> work with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in developing a legislative proposal to resolve the problem.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> eventually will have to negotiate with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to gain the release of American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but insisted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would not consider paying any kind of ransom. `` We're looking at every channel that we can find to try and get them, and I imagine that the ultimate is going to have to be somehow a negotiation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, because they have control of those people,'' he told a news conference Thursday. `` We are hopeful that there can be avenues that would open'' for the release of the hostages, he said. `` We can not enter into negotiating in the sense of what kind of ransom to pay, or you are just encouraging more hostage-taking.'' And in perhaps his last White House news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeated that he did not believe his administration was bargaining with terrorists when it entered into the Iran-Contra affair. `` We were not negotiating with them in the so-called Iran-Contra affair at all. We were heeding a plea from some individuals ... And these people were among those who were planning ahead to have a government'' after the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> remains the spiritual head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would be willing to negotiate with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, with which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has had no formal diplomatic ties since the 1979-81 hostage crisis. `` There are conditions that have to be met also there. Anytime that they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, speaking to reporters immediately after the news conference, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was not referring to any new circumstances under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would negotiate with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, saying the terms that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alluded to `` are the same conditions that we've been talking about all along.'' `` We have said that there would have to be authoritative representatives of the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'' to negotiate with and that `` they would have to acknowledge this publicly,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We'll be glad to talk, but we've never been able to get them to do that,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that releasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian elements was not a precondition to discussions with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, also said that the administration `` has always maintained that we are prepared to talk with the Iranians if it is somebody that is serious and somebody in authority.'' `` We have extended an invitation to meet in a serious setting, and have not gotten any response to that,'' she said. `` We have maintained all along that any one with influence with the kidnappers, and that includes the Iranians, should use it to win their freedom.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office for Counter-Terrorism says that as of Oct. 5, 1988, 15 foreign hostages remain in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s news conference Thursday night PRESIDENT REAGAN: We've got to stop meeting like this. Well, as most of you know, President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has had to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> due to the enormity of the tragedy in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. And in a phone conversation this morning, I conveyed to him the deep sympathy of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and our anxiousness to provide any humanitarian assistance we possibly can. The nature of President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s departure is unfortunate and provides a sad final note to what has been an otherwise successful _ and I use the next words advisedly _ happy and historic visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was in this spirit that yesterday at lunch I presented Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a memento of our first meeting _ an inscribed photo of the walk we took together in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985. The inscription read simply: `` We have walked a long way together to clear a path for peace.'' And so we have. It was exactly one year ago today that an event here in this room spoke to the epoch-making nature of what has been achieved _ the signing of the first treaty to eliminate an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles. Even in the short year since then we've had the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit here. In our negotiating agenda of regional conflicts, human rights, bilateral exchanges and arms reductions, we've seen a serious movement and even some breakthroughs. And yesterday's address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was not only a part of this process, it was the result of this process, and I congratulate him on it. On a personal note, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I were delighted that the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> extended an invitation for us to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. And as we have done before, each of us expressed the hope that they would visit us in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. So the path remains open and the pace of peace continues. As I said yesterday, this means our responsibilities have grown not less but more serious. We must remain resolute and without illusion, and we must speak candidly about fundamental points of difference. We must especially maintain our military strength. But we must also continue our course of vigorous diplomatic engagement. I can not tonight attempt to put all these events in perspective, or still less, to claim credit for any person or administration. Let it be enough to say this, that since 1985, extraordinary things have happened, and nothing more extraordinary than the sight yesterday of a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and a future president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and a president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, standing together in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> under the protective gaze of the Statue of Liberty. Our hope, our prayer, remains the same as that heard on the lips of so many millions who looked up once, as we did yesterday, to see the outstretched lamp of liberty, and who felt for the first time its warmth and glow, a prayer that someday freedom will light the world and become the blessing and birthright of every people everywhere. And <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, you have the first question.

<TEXT>
 QUESTION: The world is applauding the initiative that _ the new detente that you and President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have initiated. But on the debit side, as you leave office, the nation is saddled with a $ 2.6 trillion debt, an enormous deficit, caused perhaps by the tripling of military spending and tax cuts. How does all this jibe with the goals that you set eight years ago? And I'd like to follow up. ANSWER: <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, I have to tell you, it is incorrect to say that all of this happened because we cut taxes, and the things that have happened in these last few years. I have said many times, and pointed out, that over 58 years, in which the opposing party held the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> 54 of those 58 years, and in those years there were only eight scattered years in which there was a balanced budget. And I was among a great chorus, out on the hustings, speaking out against this consistent and constant deficit spending. And each time, the answer came back that it was necessary to maintain prosperity, and the other part of the answer was, and it's meaningless, `` Because we owe it to ourselves. Now, beginning in 1965, in the middle'60s, when the _ when President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s program of the War on Poverty was put in place, in the 15 years from then until 1980, the budget increased just about five times what it had been 15 years before, and the deficit increased to 58 times what it had been So, we came in inheriting literally deficit spending built into the structure of government. Now, with regard to the tax cuts, yes, the rates were cut. But since 1981, our revenue from those taxes has increased by $ 375 billion. And our projection _ and we've been very accurate on our projections _ our projection for 1990 and the budget we're working on now calls for another $ 80 billion increase in our revenues with the rates as they presently are. If you look back beyond us to <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> and his tax cuts, if you'll look to the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> tax cut in his administration, which was very similar to the one that we later put in, in every case it did not reduce the government revenues; it raised them. So, it is maintaining this and continuing to get back to a reduced spending because the spending increase, while the revenue was increasing $ 375 billion, the spending increase was close to $ 100 billion more than that increase in revenues. Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, some of your former associates claim that you deliberately created a larger deficit in order to dismantle the compassionate social programs for the poor, the sick, the needy, the handicapped, the elderly, which you did n't like. Is that true? A: No, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, it is not true, and that is, I guess, political propaganda also. Actually, the reductions that we have made have not been made in the actual basic spending. I have cut the increases that were asked for, but also, we have taken action to vastly improve the business management of government. When I came here, there was a program, one program _ I found out about it when I was governor _ a program in which the administrative overhead was so great that it cost $ 2 to deliver $ 1 to a needy person. Now, this is the thing _ one of the things that we've been trying to correct. But actually, there has been an ongoing increase in college _ the aid to college students, there has been an ongoing increase in housing with all of the talk about the need for housing _ that has been increased _ and I could go on about all the other programs that they have. We've simply tried to keep the increase from being as much as was being asked for. And actually, our defense spending and what we asked for, regardless of the cuts that were then made in it, the ones that I asked for, the annual budgets for defense, were less than the projected budgets necessary for defense for five years, the five years that President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had projected ahead of what was going to be needed for defense, and he projected more than we asked for.

 Q: Mr. President, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> yesterday announced a major cutback in Soviet troop strength and he talked generally about nations relying less on military might. Do you think that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to remake the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into a less threatening country? A: Yes, I do. And I think he recognizes that their massive buildup has been responsible for the great economic crisis that he faces there in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And yes, he has proposed this, but, even so, there still will be room for some negotiations on arms because this still leaves them with a superiority in the amount of conventional weapons that they have. Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, if I may follow up. Aside from the conventional forces, where the Soviets do retain this advantage, is there an area where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might be able to make a unilateral cutback in arms itself? A: Well, we're still way below them in that. But we have announced our willingness to continue and to _ well, before he ever made this move. And we're very grateful for this. I appreciate it very much. But we have proposed that the next negotiations with regard to military, and between us, should be in the area of conventional weapons. Q: Mr. President, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been receiving advice on all fronts, it seems, to raise taxes. I wondered if you think he can hold the line and not raise taxes for a full four years? And if he should cave in and raise them, would you be deeply disappointed in him? A: Yeah, I would be deeply disappointed. And I do n't think it's going to happen, because I think he is aware, as I am, that rates reduced actually increase the economic growth of the country and provide an incentive for more earnings Today, the top 5 percent of earners _ when I hear these people start talking about the upper levels of income _ the top 5 percent of earners in this country, at this much lower rate of taxation, are paying a bigger share of the total revenue from the income tax than they were paying before at the higher rates, because there's now an incentive to go out and not look for tax shelters and so forth. Q: Sir, if I could follow up. Do you really feel it's possible simply to grow out of the deficit? Or, is it necessary, if you're not going to raise taxes, to cut Social Security benefits and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits

<TEXT>
 A: We do n't have to touch Social Security, and we do n't have to have taxes. We have _ as I've said, we are _ we're on a line right now, that is bringing the deficit down. There was no way anyone could ever pull the rug out and have the deficit solved in one year. But the deficit will be reduced down under the Gramm-Rudman scale that we're following to $ 100 billion. And by 1993, the budget will be balanced if we continue observing this thing. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>? Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, this is your final news conference with us, you say?. And, at your first news conference, you said that the Soviets would commit any crime, would lie, would cheat, would steal to achieve their political goals. Now, tonight, you are celebrating your joint progress with President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and celebrating a speech in which he renounced the use of force by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to achieve foreign policy goals. Do you think that he has really changed? And to the extent that he has changed, have you changed? What have you learned over these eight years that may have changed your view of the Soviet system? A: I know so many of you quoted this in that first press conference of mine, and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, I think it was your question. Q: She stole my question. A: Yes. But, none of you ever thought to give the complete answer. I said, in their own words, this was their philosophy, and it was in writing that there was no crime. All of these things were not a crime if they advanced the cause of socialism. Now, I did n't make that up That's what they said. I think there's been a change. That was four leaders back before this one. And I think there have been some changes. I _ one, we just talked about earlier, of his cut in armaments. Q: Mr. President, to follow up, what about the changes in your own thinking? Granted that they have changed and that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a very different kind of Soviet leader, but do you think in any way that your previous views might have been rigid or poorly formed? A: Well, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>, there were differences in these leaders. And there is a situation now where many of the things that they've preached have been proven unsound and that's why their economy is in such great trouble But, I must say, I have never met with one of those leaders that was comparable to this man or had the approach that he has. But, he knows that I feel that that _ well, we put it this way, as I've said, my philosophy is, trust everybody, but cut the cards. Q: I was going to ask that, but let me just now ask you, what's the toughest thing that you've had in your job What's been the toughest part of these eight years? And I have a follow-up. A: -LRB- Laughter -RRB- You realize how much time you're stealing with these follow-ups, away from others that want to ask a question? Well, there _ Q: Yeah. Yeah. A: I think there have been many tough things. I do n't think there's anything tougher than to have to order these magnificent young men and women in our military today _ and I think I'm prouder of them than of anything that has happened _ to have to send them into danger, to order them to go some place where their lives are threatened and their lives are taken. That's got to be something that any president would hesitate on, and I have to say was the greatest burden.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: greatest burden.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: All right, let me ask the other side then. What have you enjoyed most? What is the thing you're going to miss the most? A: Well there are a number of things to miss, but let me _ I do n't want to get into a lecture here. Let me just simply say on enjoyed the most is the economic recovery. When I came here, for almost half a century, the debate on the hill in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had always been between more big spending programs, more power for the federal government, more intervention in private affairs by the federal government as against those who were preaching less. Well now today and for a long time, the very question that was asked here about the deficit, the argument on the hill today is not more spending. The argument is how best can we reduce the deficit. Q: Comment personally, sir. I mean, personally as president. A: Well, I appreciate very much the fact of being a party to this economic recovery. We were in a disaster situation when we came here. <PERSON> Trude </PERSON>. Q: Mr. President, until recently, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been reluctant for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to play a significant role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But now with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new cooperation or openness, how do you suppose you could use him to expedite the peace process? A: Well I think that once again, here we're going to have to see whether this is still acceptable to the parties that are to be involved in the direct negotiations. Actually we talk an international gathering or something, but the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which is still technically in a state of war, that must be resolved between the nations of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in direct negotiations. And if we can help bring that about, then I would welcome anyone who wants to help. Q: In light of his speech yesterday at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, are there any new steps that we can take to reduce the _ to continue the arms reduction process? A: Oh, yes. I _ we have long said that as soon as we once settle this issue of the START agreement, I have said that I think our next goal must be to now engage in negotiations on reducing conventional weapons. Q: Mr. President, one question and no follow-ups. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- A: This man deserves a hand. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q: Now that you're leaving the White House, or will soon, what is going to become of the Contras, the resistance forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, without you here as their champion? And do you have a commitment from President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to carry on the same policy line that you have for supporting the Nicaraguan resistance? A: <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, obviously I do not try to pin him down. He is the president-elect and he will be the president when he takes over. But I do believe, knowing him and what he _ and our association together for all these years, I believe that he agrees with me that the Contras are freedom fighters, and they are trying to achieve democracy in their country, which is now a communist totalitarian government.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: totalitarian government.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: Mr. President, you've made a career lately of using an old <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> proverb, `` trust but verify.'' But given that verification can never be 100 percent science, given that there are always a few percentage points where you just ca n't be sure, do you trust General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for those few points? A: Well, I've said _ right now, with regard to the INF treaty, we have worked out verification provisions that are greater than anything that has ever been done before between us. And I think that there is a reasonable chance that _ a very reasonable chance _ that we can continue to have that kind of verification. One of the first things that I talked over with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> when we first met was that I said to him, we both did n't have great military _ -LRB- pauses -RRB- _ well, how did I say it? -LRB- chuckles -RRB- _ put it that we _ that we did n't mistrust each other because of our great military; we had our military because we mistrusted each other, and that our negotiations should be aimed at removing the causes of mistrust. And I have to say, it's pretty much followed that pattern. Q: Well, what I want to know is do you trust <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>? A: He has n't shown me any reason yet that I should n't. But, again, as I've said, that's why I kept referring to `` doveryai, no proveryai,'' trust but verify, and he knows that. And that's _ neither one of us I do n't _ I do n't think that he would gamble on believing that he should n't protect his own interests also. Q: Mr. President, at your meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> yesterday, you toasted the things that he and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will accomplish. You spoke this evening about the grave economic crisis that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faces. What is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assessment of his long-term chances for political survival? A: Well, I realize, and I think we all should, that he is battling a bureaucracy, because whether it's a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> bureaucracy or one of our own, the first rule of bureaucracy is protect the bureaucracy. And it would mean some great changes for some of the `` Nomenklatura,'' as they call their bureaucracy there, if he institutes the reforms that he's talking about. But, on the plus side for him, it's very evident that the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are on his side. They want this _ this perestroika and this glasnost that he has talked about _ very much. And I have to believe that the nomenklatura is going to have to think twice with regard to how far they would go in trying to block him when the man in the street over there wants the things that have been seen. Let me go over here for a minute. I've been kind of one-sided. Q: Mr. President, you could help Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in clearing up a domestic political problem, that is, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ how to pull out of there with honor. He suggested at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> yesterday, an in-place cease-fire, a cessation of outside military aid. Some people think this could lead to a partition of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. What's wrong with that? It would save lives; it would help Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Mr. Gorbachev?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A: Well, there's one thing, if we're talking about disarming the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION>, remember that there is still a military force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that was organized by the puppet government established by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And they are a force that has been fighting, along with the Soviet, and side by side against the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION>. If you want to get around to disarming both sides, you ca n't suddenly disarm the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION> and leave them at the mercy of this already military management. Q: But Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> yesterday, sending in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force just to do this. A: Well, you'd have to take up with the U.N. I _ this is something rather exceptional that he's asking on that, and I'm not sure that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> would like that, or that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to do such a thing. Q: What would you like? A: I think that the _ we've got to recognize that if the Afghan people are going to be able to state and create the government they want, then that puppet government has got to be ready and willing to step down, and not have some kind of a compromise thing in which it remains as a government with _ compromising with the others. Let's let them start from scratch and build the government they want Q: Mr. President, let me bring you back to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. You've got very little time left, and Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, seems to be inching towards the kind of conditions you and Mr. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have said he should. Is n't this perhaps not time to go the inch in his direction and start some kind of talks with Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, rather than, as Mr. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did, close the door on him? A: No, we've been watching very closely. And for example, we've thought in the last few days that there was a statement that came out of that meeting in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, that appeared to be clean-cut and not with the things around the edge that then diffused what seemed to be a pledge But we had to wait until his press conference and what he said. And I have to say that, again, he has left openings for himself where he can deny that he meant this or meant that, that sounded so clean-cut. It's up to him. We are willing to meet with him, and talk with him, and I'm sure the Israelis would be, when once and for all it is clear-cut that he is ready to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to be a nation, that he is ready to negotiate on behalf of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people for a homeland for them, and so forth. And this is all. Now, the thing about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s decision _ I'd like to call to your attention, there is a law, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, with regard to the conditions for granting a waiver to someone to come in and meet with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, or participate in what they're doing And there is no way under that law that Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> qualifies as yet. And the day that he does, and it is clear-cut, then he _ we can grant that visa. But as I say, he is barred by the terms of that law, and the only way that the _ and the secretary of state has full power under that law. It's his decision to make. And he can only grant a waiver if an individual meets certain requirements, and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> does n't.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Arafat doesn't.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: Well, to follow up and be just as clear-cut, did he not, in his statement, say that he accepts the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> articles and that he recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>? What is the fine line that he has n't crossed? A: What we're still analyzing is, then, as he went on, other things in which it's a case, and this has happened before, certainly with the same individual _ you could quote to him, oh you said this, but he's still in a position to say, well yes, but wait a minute, I also said this. And then you find that the second `` this'' kind of reduces or nullifies the first `` this.'' Q: In your opening statement, you made reference to our military strength. Sir, a principal element of this nation's strength is our nuclear deterrent, and during your administration, sir, numerous nuclear production plants have been allowed to decay, including plants that produce plutonium and tritium. Sir, what have you directed your aides to do about the problem, and how serious is the threat, particularly since there are plants now in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> which have not been allowed to reopen due to safety problems? A: And we have made it very plain that we will not allow those plants to reopen until they meet the requirements and constitute no danger to the citizens of this country. And that it just has to be that cold turkey. Now I do n't think that we can be blamed for the deterioration that certainly began long before we were here. Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, if I could follow up, is n't it true that you have left President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a tremendous financial and national security challenge, not only in getting these plants back in operating order, but also in devising ways that we can dispose of our nuclear waste? A: No, we are working on that and we have been, and we've made more progress than I think we're given credit for on that, and he'll have to continue We're doing those things, and I do n't think that the problems are all money. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>? Q: Mr. President, do you have any reason to believe that the American hostages, who are still being held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, will be released after you leave office? A: I do n't think that anyone that takes over this office is going to give in, nor did I. It is, that is again one of those things _ I should have said to your question, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, that it, that you go to bed with every night. And, we are hopeful that there can be avenues that would open. We can not enter into negotiating in the sense of what kind of ransom to pay or you're just encouraging more hostage-taking. But there are other channels. We're not advocating that any individual, as some have, take it upon themselves to try to get them out. But we're looking at every channel that we can find to try and get them. And I imagine that the ultimate is going to have to be somehow a negotiation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, because they have control of those people.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: those people.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: So, you would be willing to do this negotiation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, sir, is that right? Either now or before you leave office or after Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes over? You are willing to negotiate with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the hostages? A: There have got to be some changes there too. We were not negotiating with them on the so-called Iran-Contra affair, at all. We were heeding a plea from some individuals. At that time, all of you were kind of heralding the day, in the media, that was going to come within a week that the ayatollah would no longer be the head of government because of his health, and these people were among those who were planning ahead to have a government. Q: Are you going to do it now? A: What? Q: Are you going to do it now, sir? A: There are things _ conditions that have to be met also there. Any time that they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them. Q: The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were once allies during World War II. Do you see that the beginning that have been made here with you and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, resulting in a situation where we would once more count the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an ally and have a free and open trade with them on a large-scale basis? A: I think that is all dependent on them. If it can be definitely established that they no longer are following the expansionist policy of, that was instituted in the Communist revolution, that their goal must be a one-world communist state. Now, if that has definitely been given up, and certainly there are indications that we could see that we can anticipate bringing such a thing about, then I do think that there is evidence that they do n't like being the pariah, that they might want to join the family of nations and join them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace. Q: Is that something you want, sir? A: Yes. One of the first things that I ever told him when we met, I said, `` There are two of us here in this room, just two men.'' And I said, `` We _ it's a unique situation. Between us, we have the power to start World War III. Or, between us, we have the power to bring peace to the world, a lasting peace.'' And apparently, we've been working in that direction Q: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> makes good on it, and does reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- sic -RRB- troop strength, there's talk on Capitol Hill that perhaps the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can follow suit and in the process, reduce our defense spending and make an impact on the budget deficit. Do you foresee that as a realistic possibility? A: No, if I've _ I guess I was n't switching signals here fast enough at the very beginning of this. Are you suggesting that the defense spending is _ Q: If Soviet troop posture leads to some cuts on our own and that this would help to reduce the deficit. People are already looking, some Democrats, thinking that this may help us to reduce the deficit. A: Well, once again, I must repeat, that ca n't happen with our defense spending until we have reached a parity and at which then both sides can continue the reduction of weapons and keeping it at a parity. But, that is not true today. They _ the dropping of 500,000 military personnel still leaves them with five million under arms. They have _ they still outnumber us in tanks and artillery weapons after they make these cuts. So, we have n't achieved parity, but at least, if he goes through with that and succeeds in that, he is going to bring it down to a range where I think that he would see that we could proceed and continue, then mutually reducing arms between each other. THE PRESS: Thank you, Mr. President. Merry Christmas. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Merry Christmas to you all.

 Shoddy construction of adobe, brick and prefabricated concrete buildings caused the high earthquake death toll in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a wood-poor republic located where giant plates of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s crust collide, scientists say. `` When they need a new room, they just mix up some mud and start stacking it,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s acting state geologist, said Thursday. `` They are not learning the lesson that buildings that are just mud fall down.'' A similar-sized quake in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, where building codes are stringent, probably would kill no more than 1,000 people, said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who spent two years conducting research east of the Armenian quake's epicenter. `` Earthquakes do n't kill people. Buildings do,'' seismologist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> added during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting. Wednesday's severe quake, centered in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> region near the Soviet-Turkish border, registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Reports indicate tens of thousands of people died. `` It's a tragedy for all the people of my country,'' said <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Zonenshain </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of Oceanology geologist attending the geophysics convention. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said many Armenian village huts are adobe, while buildings in cities often are unreinforced masonry or tilt-up, prefabricated structures made of concrete slabs that are simply hooked together. Village homes have `` thick mud and rock ceilings for insulation in winter,'' and they kill when they collapse, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. While urban Armenian construction practices have improved somewhat, `` they are still not up to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> building codes,'' he added. <PERSON> Zonenshain </PERSON> agreed that many urban Armenian buildings are unreinforced and said they are built `` from stony blocks of volcanic material.'' <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> lacks enough trees for widespread use of wood buildings, which better withstand quakes, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey scientist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s seismology section. `` A 6.9 earthquake that is shallow in the crust in that part of the world often does a lot of damage because of the nature of the construction,'' he said. Soviet scientists were aware of the threat of major quakes in the region between the Black and Caspian seas, but many of their studies suggesting which areas are most vulnerable `` are not made known to the authorities or judged by any councils'' of scientists, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcaru </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorology </ORGANIZATION> and Geophysics in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zonenshain </PERSON> denied the allegation, saying, `` We have special councils organized for -LRB- quake -RRB- prediction,'' and they have power to tell authorities to improve construction practices. <PERSON> Bilham </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> were created by the collision of the Eurasian Plate of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s crust on the north and the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plate </LOCATION> on the south. The quake occurred along the boundary of the Eurasian Plate and a `` microplate'' crunched in between the two giant plates, he said. The boundary also underlies parts of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. In 1667, a major quake killed an estimated 80,000 people in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> region, <PERSON> Bilham </PERSON> said. That jolt's magnitude was between 7 and 7.5, and `` great'' quakes measuring about 8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale rock the region roughly every 1,000 years, so `` 6.9 is not a very big earthquake for that region,'' <PERSON> Purcaru </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zonenshain </PERSON> said the epicenter of Wednesday's quake was in an area known as a `` seismic gap,'' which had a lull in major quake activity for about the last 50 years. Seismic gaps are where the lack of quakes lets stress build up on faults, making the area more likely to experience a big quake. `` They may have been complacent in the last 50 years because they did n't have big earthquakes'' in that period, said seismologist <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Niazi </PERSON>, a native Iranian and seismologist at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Purcaru </PERSON> said the jolt probably was caused by `` thrust'' or `` dip-slip'' motion, in which compression by the plates makes ground on one side of a fault move upward over ground on the other side. Similar quakes included the 6.4-magnitude <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> quake in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1971, which state officials say killed at least 58 people, and last year's 5.9-magnitude <ORGANIZATION> Whittier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narrows </ORGANIZATION> quake, which, with its aftershocks, killed eight Southern Californians.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes blasted guerrilla positions Friday in hills overlooking this coastal town near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as they tried to rescue trapped paratroopers who landed by helicopter before dawn, police said. They said at least one Israeli soldier was killed and two others wounded in a clash between the Israeli landing party and guerrillas of a pro-Syrian Palestinian faction and a leftist Lebanese group. `` Other Israeli troops have been captured, but we do not know their number yet. It seems the Israelis are surrounded,'' said a police officer in <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>. He can not be named under standing rules. There was no immediate confirmation from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military command, which usually issues its communiques only after its operation has been completed. Gunboats cruised off <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> as five helicopter gunships hovered overhead, apparently waiting to evacuate the Israeli commandos who landed on <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>'s bluffs at 2:10 a.m., the spokesman said. Eight fighter-bombers thundered in from the clear <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sky at dayrteak to blast hilltop targets east of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> in 15 bombing sorties, police said. `` They are attacking roughly at 15-minute intervals, obviously trying to help break the noose around their trapped paratroopers in the <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> hills,'' the spokesman said. The assault began at 6:40 a.m. Black smoke billowed from stricken targets perched in olive groves above <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, police said. <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> is nine miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and 16 miles north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Ambulances were dispatched from both cities after the attack. The area is controlled by the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and leftist militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from the stricken bluffs to the coastal highway linking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. They were believed rushing casualties to hospitals in both cities. Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as the planes staged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 24th air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Fighters of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and their Druse allies unleashed a screen of shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, known as <PERSON> Strellas </PERSON>, against the raiding jets, but no hits were scored, police said. They said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pilots released hot air balloons to deflect the heat-seeking missiles. The Popular Front, headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, is armed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and funded by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It is at odds with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organiztion </ORGANIZATION>. Dozens of guerrillas and militiamen, all toting shoulder-fired rocket - propelled grenades were seen running to positions along <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>'s beach as five Israeli helicopter gunships hovered opposite the coastal town at 8:15 a.m. `` They're going to land troops,'' one guerrilla was heard shouting as he raced to the beachstrip Panicky shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundreds of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> residents scurried to take shelter in basements. At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 23 previous air raids on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Jan. 3.

 At a small park near the seashore, <PERSON> Ofelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> says sales at her newsstand of Soviet magazines were negligible two years ago. Now, she says, she prepares for a stampede whenever certain Soviet publications translated into Spanish arrive, particularly the monthly `` Sputnik'' and the weekly `` News of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' The difference between now and two years ago is `` glasnost,'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s experiment with allowing open debate on issues once rarely discussed outside <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> walls. Glasnost has helped boost sales for Ms. <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>. She says she gets about 60 copies each of the two magazines per delivery. `` They're gone in about five minutes,'' she says, recalling the time not long ago when the same publications were discarded for lack of buyers. Today was to have been the day <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, offering an opportunity to measure his appeal among ordinary Cubans. But he cut short his three-nation trip Thursday and rushed back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to supervise relief efforts in earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. For Cubans who sense that Marxism is here to stay but who are eager for a more flexible system, the Soviet leader is the most promising development in years. Several Cubans privately confess their admiration for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They hope for Soviet-style reforms in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where outspokenness is discouraged and the economy has stagnated for years. However, millions of other Cubans appear to have retained their allegiance to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who has made no secret of his disdain for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. He has left the impression that he is worried the system in place for 70 years in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could unravel under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has insisted <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will never accept any reform that `` reeks of capitalism.'' His inflexible stand has led to speculation about a possibly serious Soviet-Cuban rift. Despite the tension, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> authorities had planned for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the grandest reception ever staged for a visiting luminary, with a projected 500,000 lining the parade route. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Cuban analysts agree that the foundation of Soviet-Cuban friendship remains solid. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> helps the Soviets collect political support worldwide, and the Soviets lavish an estimated $ 5 billion in annual economic aid on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Some Westerners, however, believe the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been dissatisfied with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> economic performance for years. It is not known if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pressured <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to impose capitalist-style reforms to revive the Cuban economy. With the postponement of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, the answer probably will not be forthcoming for now.

 Demands for new peacekeeping missions could force the financially strapped <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> into insolvency in 1989, according to a report by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's pessimistic assessment was released Thursday before he left for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, to accept the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers worldwide. The Nobel includes a cash prize worth about $ 390,000, but that wo n't make much of a dent in the $ 450.1 million in unpaid dues that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members owe. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owes $ 337.3 million. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have n't announced how the award money being collected Saturday will be used. On Wednesday, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and called for a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to oversee establishment of a broad-based government. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials already are drafting plans for a 7,500-member peacekeeping force to monitor <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s transition to independence. Plans also are under way to send 2,000 peacekeeping troops to monitor an independence referendum in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> predicted that in 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will collect $ 779.3 million but will spend $ 803.9 million, ending the year with a loss of $ 24.6 million. He based his projections on current payment patterns. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has yet to leave behind the spectre of the financial crisis. Throughout 1988, the organization has confronted the possibility of imminent bankruptcy, which it has narrowly managed to avoid so far,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> wrote in the report. Only 79 of the 159 member states had paid all their dues as of Nov. 30, he said. `` Of the 80 member states still in arrears, 40 owed more than their 1988 assessments,'' he added. Assuming next year's payment patterns are like 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said `` the organization would manage to avoid insolvency, but only by once again utilizing its reserves to meet cash requirements at many points during the year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has a contingency reserve fund of about $ 210 million that must be replenished as soon as new dues are paid. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> often dips into this fund to start new peacekeeping operations or to meet operating costs. `` The financial situation of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> could rapidly and dramatically deteriorate should any additional demands be placed upon these depleted reserves to meet the cash requirements for existing or new peacekeeping operations,'' the report says. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in September that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would gradually repay all its dues. It has withheld money in recent years to protest what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration saw as mismanagement, overstaffing, and an anti-Western bias at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The earthquake that devastated several cities and wiped out villages in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> may have also doomed priceless medieval art and early Christian churches in the region, an art historian said. `` That area is full of medieval monuments and churches,'' said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON>, professor of Armenian art and architecture at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some are over a thousand years old.'' Wednesday's earthquake destroyed two-thirds of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a city of 250,000 people 30 miles from the epicenter, and wiped out the nearby village of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a Soviet TV correspondent said. Early estimates put the death toll at 50,000 to 70,000. Atop a mountain less than a mile from <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is a 7th century church called St. Stepanos, which contains rare wall paintings. A domed church made of rose and brown-colored volcanic stone, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stepanos </LOCATION> is a `` priceless treasure,'' <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON> said. She fears it may have been destroyed becaues it is so close to the quake's center, but she said she has not been able to find out. Also within a few miles of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is an 11th century Marmashen church and a 13th century monastery called <PERSON> Harich </PERSON>, which has a museum that may contain priceless medieval gospel manuscripts, <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON> said. Across the border from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are the ruins of the 9th century capital city of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Ani </PERSON>. Scholars believe that city's 10th century cathedral may have been the inspiration for Romanesque and Gothic architecture in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, she said. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was the first country to make Christianity its official religion in the year 314, <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON> said. Its early stone churches are of special interest because some scholars believe that Europeans learned the building techniques used on their towering cathedrals from the Armenians. `` The Soviets have been spending million of rubles to restore these Armenian churches,'' <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON> said. `` Whatever is destroyed of medieval Armenian architecture is a terrific loss, because the ones in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are n't being taken care of.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stocks Up Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against the Japanese yen today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while stock prices rose moderately as participants weighed the impact of the resignation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s finance minister. The dollar ended the week at 122.43 yen, down 0.59 yen from Thursday's closing of 123.02 yen. After opening sharply lower at 122.20 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency edged up, ranging between 122.10 and 122.47 yen during the day. The dollar's decline in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed a drop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where it closed Thursday at 122.28 yen. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, many participants began selling the dollar after Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> announced his resignation, said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Many traders feared the departure of <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who had opposed a weaker dollar, could damage current international monetary coordination, he said. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> announced his resignation near midday, saying he wished to clear the way for the passage of tax reform bills now being discussed in the upper house of parliament. Opposition parties had opposed a continuation of debate on the bills until <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned because of inconsistencies in his accounts of his involvement in a stock trading scandal. Dozens of politicians and other influential people have been linked to the scandal, involving the purchase of unlisted shares in <LOCATION> Recruit-Cosmos </LOCATION>, a real-estate company, at bargain prices, and their subsequent resale when the stock began being traded publicly. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s resignation and appointed himself finance minister. He told reporters today that <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s departure from the Cabinet would not have a strong impact on exchange markets. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which plunged 291.92 points Thursday, regained 34.52 points or 0.11 percent, closing the week at 29,793.42. Many traders stayed on the sidelines because of caution over the possible impact of <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s resignation on the currency and stock markets, dealers said. <PERSON> Toshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yui </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> rose in spite of the wait-and-see mood because of lingering bullishness from the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index having achieved the 30,000-point level for the first time on Wednesday and the rise of the dollar after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s announcement of an arms reduction. `` Minor stocks have been attracting participants recently, which is likely to help the market accumulate strength,'' he said. <PERSON> Yui </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index has been strong because the Japanese economy is expanding, whereas the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to run large trade and budget deficits. Volume traded on the market's first section was estimated at 1 billion shares.

<DATELINE>JEBALIYA, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year after the Palestinian uprising began, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers believe they are gradually regaining control of the streets despite ongoing clashes. Talks with soldiers in both the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> indicate morale is much improved since the chaotic early days of the uprising, when thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> joined demonstrations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation. Today, the best evidence things have changed is that confrontations are usually limited to skirmishes with small groups of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths who appear only long enough to hurl a stone before vanishing into the narrow alleyways. `` In the beginning we used to face crowds of 5,000 people. Now we are dealing with at most about 100,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Micha </PERSON>, whose infantry unit recently returned to this squalid refugee camp of 70,000. <PERSON> Micha </PERSON> recalls that in December 1987 his unit was transferred from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and thrust into the riots without training or the necessary tools. `` We got here and we suddenly had no weapons to use, no artillery, no tanks,'' said <PERSON> Micha </PERSON>, whose full name was not disclosed in keeping with army policy. `` We had clubs, and they had sticks, and we battled like gangs. Officers were simply told to make the situation quiet, and there was a lot of gray in the orders so every soldier had his own method for dealing with the population.'' At least 320 Palestinians have been killed in the rebellion since it began Dec. 8, 1987, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Eleven Israelis also have been slain and 7,000 Palestinians wounded during the same period. In recent interviews, army commanders attributed the drop in large protests to improved crowd control devices such as plastic bullets, which are less lethal than live ammunition and allow soldiers to use rifles more freely. The army also has developed fender-mounted tear-gas launchers, rooftop guns that fire rubber bullets, hot marbles or gravel, and a wagon equipped with a scoop to remove roadblocks. `` Soldiers feel they have an answer. There is no longer such frustration and feelings of impotence. The soldiers feel they control the situation,'' said Col. <PERSON> Segev </PERSON>, who commands troops in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest town. Taunted by demonstrators who hurled provocative insults as well as stones and bottles, soldiers sometimes lost control, beating detainees or smashing houses and cars. In one case last spring in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> village, soldiers used a bulldozer to bury alive four Palestinians. The four were rescued by witnesses minutes later. The army said 45 soldiers have been court-martialed since last December for using excessive force. More soldiers have been disciplined through less formal trials. The army will not say how many. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, the chief army education officer, described the number of violations as `` minor'' when compared to the thousands of soldiers who have been sent to the occupied areas. Israeli newspapers say the army has an average of 10,000 troops deployed each day in the occupied territories _ several times the pre-uprising level. In an interview, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> emphasized repeatedly that the army believed excessive force would have a boomerang effect. `` If we want to bring some tranquility, some peace to the area, the less we create polarization and hatred by revenge the more chances there are for better future understanding,'' he said. The new emphasis on restraint is contained in a two-day course instituted recently to prepare soldiers for duty in the occupied areas and in a new briefing kit prepared for commanders. Gross said the army's mission was to restore enough order to `` enable the government to make its decisions free from pressure, or under the least amount of pressure possible.'' He claimed the army `` can cope with the mission, and we can fulfill it.''

 A former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has been indicted on insider trading charges for a scheme to leak secret interest rate figures to a now-bankrupt brokerage firm.

Rough, 49, received $ 47,000 in interest-deferred loans from the now-defunct <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bresler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schulman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm in exchange for the rate information, the indictment charged. He was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s regional network, from 1982 to 1984. Rough was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire fraud and securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks. He faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts and fines totaling $ 141,000, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. Rough is accused of relaying the information by telephone from his executive suite at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, where he served as president, and once from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s boardroom just after a meeting, prosecutors said at a news conference. <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> made millions of dollars in government securities trades based on Rough's advance word about decisions made by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and recommendations offered by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on the discount rate, the indictment said. The discount rate is the interest rate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to commercial banks. Changes in the discount rate can have a strong impact on world financial markets and affect interest rates paid by consumers. Rough's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON>, said Rough would enter a plea of not guilty and `` vigorously contest the charges.'' Rough's home telephone number was unlisted and he could not be reached for comment. He resigned earlier this year as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is one of 12 regional banks in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, all of which make recommendations every two weeks on whether the discount rate should be changed. The national <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has the final say in setting the rate. Word that discount rate information had been leaked first surfaced in April 1987, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its rules on disclosing the rate. The allegations came to light during the trial of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON>'s president, on fraud charges after the firm's $ 144 million collapse in April 1985. Three other principals who pleaded guilty in the firm's collapse in exchange for their cooperation testified about Rough's allegedly passing on the information. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, a long-time friend of Rough's, is serving an eight-year sentence for securities violations. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> testified that Rough approached him for the $ 47,000 in loans, which were repaid, to buy a chunk of stock in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION>. No arraignment date has been set.

<HEAD>500 U.S. Infants Die Each Year from Diarrhea _ But Don't Need to</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers say simple health care measures could save most of the 500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children who die each year of diarrhea, a problem rarely considered life-threatening in this country. New research suggests that diarrhea accounts for 10 percent of all preventable deaths in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> youngsters ages 1 month to 4 years old, said Dr. <PERSON> Mei-Shang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> of the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The key here is early treatment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. Diarrhea is a common cause of childhood deaths in developing countries, but such deaths generally are thought to be rare in more economically advanced nations. However, Ms. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> and her colleagues identified 5,539 diarrhea deaths among youngsters ages 1 month to 4 years nationwide during the years 1973 through 1983. Deaths were most common among children younger than 1 year, blacks and youngsters living in the South, the researchers reported in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Thirty-eight percent of the deaths occurred after the child had reached a medical facility _ suggesting either the youngsters got help too late or got the wrong treatment, Ms. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said. She estimated that 80 percent to 90 percent of the diarrhea deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be prevented. Diarrhea can be fatal if it causes severe loss of fluids and electrolytes _ body salts such as sodium and potassium _ that are necessary for normal functioning of nerves and muscles, including the heart, Ms. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> explained. Lost fluids need to be replaced with electrolyte solutions containing glucose, a form of sugar, she said. The solutions can be bought ready-to-drink at grocery and drug stores without prescriptions, she said. Infants who ca n't keep the fluids down or who lose more than they keep should be taken to a doctor, Ms. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said. Parents need to be taught the dangers of severe diarrhea, she said, as well as ways to give appropriate fluids when the need arises and when to see a doctor if that strategy fails. `` It should n't be hard to acquire those skills, if it is pushed by health caretakers. It's not pushed enough in this country,'' she said. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of Children's Hosptial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> called the overall findings `` troubling,'' especially since black victims outnumbered whites four to one. He agreed that educational efforts would be `` the most direct and immediate answer to this grave problem.'' Many different organisms can cause diarrhea, including bacteria and parasites, but a type of virus called rotavirus causes one-third of all childhood diarrhea cases requiring hospitalization, the researchers said. Bacteria and parasites can be avoided with careful hand-washing and food preparation, but rotaviruses are virtually inescapable and almost everyone gets infected by them at some point during childhood, Ms. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Air Force: No Grounding for A-10s Despite Two Crashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRACY, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has no plans to ground the A-10 attack plane despite two crashes in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that occurred within hours of each other, leaving six people dead and 51 injured. `` I can tell you from this standpoint, we're not tying the two of them together,'' <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Keck </PERSON> said here following Thursday's crashes. An A-10 Thunderbolt II assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> smashed into an apartment house in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, at 1:30 p.m. local time -LRB- 7:30 a.m. EST -RRB-, killing six people and injuring 51, authorities said. Ten hours later, an A-10 based at <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> crashed on the Tohono O'Odham Reservation near <LOCATION> Tracy </LOCATION> about 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, officials said. The pilot, who ejected, was in good condition at the base hospital. Both jets were on training missions. The <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement late Thursday that it would not ground the A-10, which statistically is the safest fighter or attack plane currently in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inventory. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, however, suspended all tactical training flights in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until Tuesday. Witnesses to the <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION> crash said the twin-engine jet hit the top floor of an apartment building. A Davis-Monthan spokesman said there was no immediate word on what caused that accident. `` We ca n't speculate on what caused the accident,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Besich </PERSON>. `` We have a board of officers formed to investigate, and they'll determine that.'' The board left for the crash site. <PERSON> Besich </PERSON> said the pilot of the single-seat airplane, Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutterfield </PERSON>, 29, of <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, gave no indication of what the problem had been. A helicopter picked Nutterfield up at 6 p.m., and flew him to the hospital, said <PERSON> Besich </PERSON>, who had no specifics on the pilot's injuries. Like many West Germans, Indians on the reservation have complained for years about low-level military flights. Objections center on the noise and the possibility of crashes, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tohono </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Odham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of these days it -LRB- the aircraft -RRB- might fall in one of these communities, on top of a house,'' he said. `` You can see them flying practically at window-level,'' said <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON>. `` That's been an issue for the last 10 years. I do n't think there's ever going to be an agreement. The A-10 is designed to support soldiers on the ground by attacking enemy tanks and other high-priority targets. The Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has more than 700 of them in its inventory. The aircraft has chalked up a major accident rate of less than four Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than 1.75 million flight hours. A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage exceeding $ 500,000 to an aircraft. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lost three A-10s.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Resigns In Wake Of Widening Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned today, becoming the first Cabinet-level casualty in a widening scandal over conflicting statements about his involvement in questionable stock purchases. `` I have many regrets, but we are not getting anywhere without clearing this deadlock,'' <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> told a news conference after submitting his resignation to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who is also giving up his position as deputy prime minister, said he is stepping down to help pave the way for passage of sweeping tax reform bills. `` I feel that accomplishing tax reform is my mission and I did not want to stand in the way of completion of the tax reform bills,'' <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said. `` Personally, I hope the tax reform bills will be passed soon and it does n't matter what happens to me.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would assume <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s post as finance minister. The prime minister is expected to shuffle his Cabinet in a few weeks, but <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> declined to say how long he would hold the finance portfolio. Opposition parties in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have been stalling debate on the tax reform, demanding first that <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resign. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> has been under fire for giving conflicting accounts about his alleged involvement in the scandal. One of <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s former aides bought shares of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before they were registered to trade over the counter, and sold them immediately for a 20 million yen -LRB- $ 163,000 -RRB- profit <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> is the most important figure to fall so far in the five-month scandal, which has shaken public confidence and implicated a range of influential figures in business and government. Public support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government has dropped to 18 percent from 30 percent when he assumed office a year ago, according to a survey released today by the mass-circulation newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. But political analysts said the resignation has been anticipated for some time and would have minimal economic and political impact. `` We knew he had to go sooner or later,'' said <PERSON> Masumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishikawa </PERSON>, a commentator for the national daily <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. `` He must have judged politically that now is the right timing to quit to give the impression that he is sacrificing himself for the sake of tax bills, rather than taking blame for the scandal.'' Opposition parties responded to the resignation with mixed signals. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary general of the largest opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the resignation was well overdue, but that his party did not intend to participate in parliamentary debate on the tax reform package. `` Since the finance minister, who is in charge of carrying out the tax reform, resigned, the tax reform bills start again from scratch,'' he said. Komeito, or the Clean Government Party, however, said in a statment that <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s resignation had cleared the way for full-fledged deliberations on the tax legislation. The legislation, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first sweeping overhaul of its tax system since the end of the World War II, has been a top priority for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for a decade. Successive administrations have failed to pass the reform due to a lack of public support and strong resistance from opposition parties. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, under whom <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> also served as finance minister, staked his political career on tax reform and lost. The new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax scales and introduces a 3-percent sales tax.

<TEXT>
 The abrupt departure of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> elicited sympathy and sadness from those who were dropped from his itinerary, but others fed up with two days of `` Gorby-lock'' had few regrets. `` The mood is very sad,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, principal of P.S. 6, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> grammar school that had hoped to host the Soviet leader's wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, Thursday afternoon. `` It's a lesson in disappointment for us all.'' The lesson was echoed at each planned stop by the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> on their final day in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader returned home a day early to lead relief efforts for victims of a massive earthquake that ravaged <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` I think the only thing we can say is to express sympathy for the earthquake victims,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, head of public relations at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, another Big Apple tourist sight missed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The Soviet President's admiring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hosts managed to squeeze in one last event just before he boarded his plane at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> just after noon Thursday. Former astronaut <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with a Soviet flag that went to the moon in 1971 with the Apollo 15 mission. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said he and his crewmates, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, signed the flag, which was one of a number of foreign flags carried by the moonwalkers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife also had planned a short stroll through Central Park before their museum visit and a morning stop at the Javits Convention Center for a Soviet trade show. `` I guess I'll just go do some Christmas shopping and go home,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrystal </PERSON>, chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, who was invited by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to attend the trade event. <PERSON> Chrystal </PERSON>'s uncle, <PERSON> Roswell </PERSON> <PERSON> Garst </PERSON>, owned the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farm that <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> visited in one of the high points of his 1959 American tour. `` Yes, we are disappointed, but who can argue with an earthquake?'' asked Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who was to be <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s host in the park. `` We hope he can come back another time.'' For the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, sympathy and sorrow gave way to relief over savings. Officials figured the visit cost $ 613,000 in overtime; the extra day would have put that figure at $ 1 million. The sighs of relief also came from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which battled mild `` Gorby-lock'' caused by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s motorcade and stifled traffic in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Wednesday. `` We're doing better now,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a spokesman for the department. Also bumped by the change in plans was billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, whose invitation to have <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit the opulent Trump Tower was rejected. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was among a group scheduled for dinner Thursday night at the Soviet Mission; instead, the closest he came to the Soviet leader was a glimpse of a <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION> look-alike on Tuesday.

 The immigration chief today said she will chop airport officials `` into 1,000 pieces'' and feed them to the sharks if they do n't stop smuggling entertainers out of the country. <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Defensor </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deportation </ORGANIZATION>, said some officials of her agency have made fortunes providing fake permits allowing Filipinos to work abroad as entertainers. Officials say many of those who leave the country illegally are recruited by criminal organizations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and elsewhere and end up working as prostitutes. `` I'm going to chop you into 1,000 pieces,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> said during a television interview. `` I'll throw you and feed you to the sharks in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. However, I doubt if the sharks would eat you out of a sense of professional courtesy.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> claimed immigration officials at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ninoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> had been faking arrest reports to fool her into believing they were cracking down on illegal activities. `` These CID employees thought they could get away with it,'' she said, shaking her finger at the camera. `` I know for a fact that these employees have been presenting alleged arrests to me in a misguided attempt to lull me into a false sense of ignorance about what is going on at the airport.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, a former judge, said her employees `` have been making fortunes from these illegal rackets at the airport right under my nose.'' In September, retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> resigned as director of security at the airport because he said he was powerless to stamp out corruption there among immigration and customs agents. In November, <PERSON> Evergisto </PERSON> <PERSON> Macatulad </PERSON> resigned as airport general manager, the third airport chief to quit since President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office in February 1986. The country's law enforcement chief, meanwhile, has ordered an investigation into allegations that police and soldiers are involved in car theft rings. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, commander of the Philippine Constabulary, issued the order Thursday after the highway patrol reported at least five military officers belonged to a car theft ring known as the `` Silver Edition.'' A highway patrol report said the five were identified by gang members arrested in a series of raids in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area. Allegations that police and soldiers were involved in criminal gangs have been widespread in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for years. On Sunday, <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> ordered the dismantling of permanent military checkpoints at the edge of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and warned soldiers against shaking down travelers for money and goods. The checkpoints were established to prevent communist rebels and right-wing extremists from entering <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. But travelers and bus companies have complained that armed troopers extort money and supplies from passengers and operators.

 With Pravda headlining `` Our pain and tragedy'' on its front page and television showing soldiers digging for schoolchildren in piles of rubble, Soviet media have covered the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with unprecedented detail and urgency. `` Helpless, sobbing people are climbing on the wreckage of an apartment house, from which can be heard heart-rending cries for help,'' Pravda reported today in a dramatic departure from its typical dry reports of Communist Party decrees and speeches. `` Powerless, without anything they can do, the living superstitiously run back and forth,'' the story said. Driven by destruction that has killed tens of thousands of people, Soviet authorities are using the media to broadcast urgent appeals for everything from heavy-duty cranes to blood. Officials also are emphasizing the need for national cooperation in coping with the tragedy, in an attempt to use the disaster to stop the ethnic strife that has killed at least 60 people in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> this year and sent 180,000 fleeing their homes in fear of mobs. Parts of both republics were being patrolled by soldiers and tanks when the quake hit. `` Reproaches and mutual offenses are thrown away'' in the aftermath of such a tragedy, Azerbaijani health minister T.A. <PERSON> Kasumov </PERSON> said on national television Thursday. `` There is a saying among the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> people: ` The pain unites,''' he said. `` Our hospitals are ready to take patients and wounded from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and they will be surrounded by special care and attention,'' <PERSON> Kasumov </PERSON> promised. That would be a stark contrast to recent weeks, when medical care and food supplies had been denied to whole neighborhoods of Armenians in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The focus of much of the Soviet reporting has been on the rescuers rather than victims. Television journalists spoke sadly of tens of thousands of dead Thursday, but their film showed crunched and crushed buildings rather than children's mangled bodies. Reporters interviewed officials about the rescue effort instead of grieving parents. Broadcasters spoke of half the city of <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION> being leveled, but they showed no aerial photos indicating the extent of the damage. Nor were there pictures of tent cities being erected to shelter families left homeless by the quake. Most Soviet photographers aimed their cameras at the relief effort: evacuation of victims by military helicopters, cranes clearing away destruction and volunteers rushing to donate blood. A few of the photographs published in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and sent abroad by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> show grieving women in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, and mothers and their bundled children huddling around campfires in the remnants of downtown <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Chistyakov </PERSON> said his agency sold one such dramatic photo to the French photo agency <ORGANIZATION> SIPA </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2,500 for its exclusive use outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I hate to sell pictures of the tragedy,'' he said. `` But we are on ` self-accounting' now, and they say we must.'' Soviet enterprises are switching to a new economic regime where they must turn a profit. Today's reports in the national newspapers were the first to detail the suffering of the victims. The story was given remarkable prominence. Pravda ran a photo of a partially collapsed building on its front page, a spot normally reserved for pictures of happy workers and politicians. The relative speed of the coverage is also remarkable in a nation that until recently ignored natural disasters. Just last week, it left unreported the hijacking of a bus full of 30 schoolchildren until foreign news agencies learned of it through air traffic control communications on the hijackers' plans to fly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> met today with eight leading Czechoslovak dissidents, the first such meeting by a Western leader on an official visit to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Leading human rights activists had voiced fears before <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s two-day visit started Thursday that it would be exploited by the Communist authorities to mute recent Western criticism of the jailing and repression of independent activists. But banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who wrote an open letter to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> last week regarding those fears, said after the 75-minute breakfast at the French embassy that the president was `` very well-informed about the situation'' in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I am very satisfied with this conversation,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. `` It is the first time a head of a state officially met independent activists. It is a new phenomenon which is very important for us.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a leading signatory of the Charter 77 human rights document, also expressed satisfaction that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> lauded the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms in a dinner speech Wednesday. The speech was printed in full this morning in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo. `` It's the first positive mention of the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> in Rude Pravo in 20 years,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, smiling. Charter 77 spokesman <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, another dissident present at the meeting, called <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s mention of the Prague Spring `` excellent.'' Others attending the meeting at the French embassy were Charter 77 signatories <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Battek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>, a banned Roman Catholic priest. <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Srp </PERSON>, leader of the independent cultural group the Jazz Section, was the eighth man present. The meeting took place a day before Communist authorities permit a demonstration called by Charter 77 and four other independent groups to mark the 40th anniversary of International Human Rights Day. For the first time since 1969, authorities have given permission for the independent gathering. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said he was sure this was connected with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s visit. `` The day after he leaves, they could not do what they did with other independent demonstrations,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. In October, hundreds of police with water cannon, tear gas, batons and dogs broke up a crowd of about 5,000 who defied a ban on a rally called by the same five groups to mark 70 years of Czechoslovak independence. Another demonstration protesting the 1968 invasion that crushed reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was also broken up by police in August.

 The British-Chinese negotiators working out details of turning <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> over to Chinese rule ended their 11th meeting today with an agreement over the territory's future extradition arrangements. The British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under an agreement reached four years ago by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Sino-British Joint Liaison Group was formed to help implement the accord. A statement from the group said the two sides `` reached agreement on the basic principles'' by which <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will make its own arrangements for extradition after 1997, but provided no details. The territory now relies on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s network of extradition treaties. `` As a major financial and commercial center, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> should be able to maintain its own network of extradition agreements,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON>, spokesman for the British team. `` Nobody wants <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to become a sort of haven for criminals which people could go to and could n't be extradited from.'' The group also discussed the withdrawal of British armed forces from the colony and arrangements for Chinese troops to be based here, but again no details were provided. The liaison group will meet next March in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 How do you make a nude statue respectable?

The commission was caught in a controversy that broke out over `` Moulding Our Future,'' a proposed 7-foot-tall bronze monument meant to celebrate love, the town's namesake. On Thursday, the commission wriggled out of the problem, tentatively approving the statue of a mother with a child at her breast for a new park, but ordering the sculpture to be turned toward a wig shop wall so it wo n't offend passers-by. The woman's breasts will also be covered by trees, hiding them from unsuspecting strollers. About 600 residents signed a petition against the statue, saying they like love and <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> but wanted the statue to have another home. Customers at the wig shop also protested. The commission is scheduled to take a final vote on the statue Dec. 16. Artist <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasken </PERSON> was happy with the compromise because the child in his work will be facing park visitors. `` This is not a nude,'' <PERSON> Hasken </PERSON> said. `` This is a mother and child.''

 City and state officials are engaged in a rat race for the control of a potentially pesky problem of rampant rodents. The city is starting a decade-long excavation and reconstruction project that some experts say could have rats overrunning the city. At odds are the director of rodent control for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and an rat-control expert hired by the state, a professor from <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The officials are arguing over a report released recently by the state that city officials claim excludes them from rat control plans and does not focus enough on early prevention. `` We question what will happen if our plans do n't jibe,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, director of the city <ORGANIZATION> Inspectional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The way the report is written, it's like people will call us with complaints and we'll have to decide if it's a complaint about a city rat or a state rat.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, on the faculty at Bowling Green, was hired by the state to develop a plan to curb the spread of rats when excavation begins downtown in 1990. The $ 4.5 billion project includes a plan to build a third tunnel under <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and transform the Central Artery from a six-lane elevated highway to an eight - to 10-lane underground expressway <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his firm, Biocenotics, issued a report on a plan to eradicate the thousands of rats expected to be uprooted from their homes during construction. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s plan calls for placing rat bait around three `` rodent control zones'' along the construction route. According to the plan, the baiting would begin 60 and 90 days before construction. The plan also calls for an education program to inform residents on rodent-proofing and sanitation, negotiations with utility agencies and public agencies about rat control. Wood charged that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s team ignored the city's seven-point plan issued last summer that outlined the need for early prevention, constant monitoring by city inspectors and an emergency team to respond to resident complaints. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> claims that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s plans concentrate on underground rodent control efforts but do not allow the city enough staff to respond to problems that arise when rats escape after construction. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was en route from <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Thursday and was not available for comment. Central Artery project director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his firm were hired because state officials believed a rat control expert was needed to develop an `` overall perspective'' of the rodent problem. `` I'm surprised at Mr. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s comments,'' he said. `` The report is peppered with references to working with city officials. We want to work with them and take their plans into consideration.''

<HEAD>Researchers Retreat From Evidence For Two New Forces Of Nature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists are retreating from studies indicating more than four basic forces of nature run the universe, citing a major flaw in experiments that suggested gravity is slightly countered by a fifth force and enhanced by a sixth. `` As yet there's no convincing evidence,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of the La Jolla-based <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION>, a participant in a research group that now questions its own findings. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a physicist at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, put the case more strongly: `` There are only four forces in nature. Read my lips. No new forces,'' he said. The scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and other institutions backtracked on statements they made last July when they reported strong evidence suggesting Sir <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s 301-year-old law of gravity was wrong. Now they say the evidence is inconclusive. That's because their measurements of gravity inside a drill hole in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>'s ice sheet could have been flawed by variations in the density of rock beneath the ice, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> concluded in a study. His calculations show `` our results do not need new forces of nature,'' and can be explained by the existing law of gravity, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said Wednesday during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting. Scientists believed for decades that there were only four fundamental forces that govern the behavior of all matter in the universe. They are gravity; electromagnetism, which creates light, electricity, radio waves and microwaves; the strong force, which holds the center of atoms together; and the weak force, which lets some atoms decay radioactively. But in 1986, an analysis by <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> physicist <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishbach </PERSON> suggested the existence of a very weak `` fifth force'' that slightly counteracts gravity over distances of roughly 10 to 1,000 yards. The theory gained support from gravity measurements made at varying depths inside a mine shaft by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queensland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Subsequent gravity measurements made on a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> television tower and in the <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> ice hole also suggested there was a `` sixth force'' that was different than gravity but gave a 1.5 percent to 4 percent boost to gravity's attraction between objects that were 1,600 to 5,500 feet apart. The mine, tower and ice studies all found slight deviations from <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>'s law, which says the gravitational attraction between two objects decreases with the square of the distance between them. For example, when two objects that were one foot apart are moved two feet apart, the gravity they exert on each other should become only one-fourth as strong. Oceanographer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chave </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION>, said planned gravity measurements at varying levels within the ocean should avoid that problem and help researchers determine whether the new forces are real. If the fifth and sixth forces exist, they might cause inertially guided missiles to miss their targets by slight distances, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> physicist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>. That's why the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> conducted the TV tower experiment. <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> believes that even if the forces found in the experiments are real, they are not distinct forces of nature, but simply show gravity is more complicated than <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> thought. Existence of fifth and sixth forces also means `` the masses of the planets and stars, as well as the universe's mass and age, would have to be recalculated,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. Such forces also would change scientists' understanding of `` the evolution of the universe in its earliest stages'' after it formed in the gargantuan explosion called the `` big bang,'' said <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>. Physicists believe that before the big bang, the four known forces existed as a single, `` unified'' force, but that in the explosion, they instantaneously diverged into separate forces and matter came into being. The ultimate goal of modern physics is to find an elegant `` theory of everything'' that explains all the forces and matter that make up the universe, and how they evolved from the unified force.

<HEAD>16,000 Condoms Stolen From Family Planning Clinic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A downtown hospital is investigating the theft of 16,000 prophylactics that has officials puzzled since the condoms are given away free in the first place. The missing condoms, discovered Wednesday by officials at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s family planning clinic, temporarily crippled a program that distributes about 500,000 condoms a year. `` It's amazing. They did clean us out,'' said <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> clinic's director, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, on Thursday `` Maybe those condoms are in the right hands now.'' Police believe the theft occurred Tuesday night. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said he found his offices trashed and telephones missing when he arrived at work Wednesday morning. `` Then we found out that in our supply room, 16,000 condoms had been stolen. We ended up with no condoms,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said. `` But most of our patients maintain a supply at home. We're just telling them to be careful.'' News of the theft prompted an <LOCATION> Eatontown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> condom manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Ansell-Americas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to replace the clinic's supply free of charge. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said each day his clinic dispenses about 2,000 condoms _ roughly 40 to 160 per patient _ and encourages clients to pass the condoms on to family members and friends. `` Our hope is that those stolen condoms are used so they help prevent unplanned pregnancies and unwanted infections,'' he said. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, who has served at the <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> clinic for 25 years, said the condom theft was a first. He urged the bandits to `` come back and see us again and we'll be glad to help.''

 Bidding goodbye after a four-week visit, Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a wonderful country but said he had no desire to move here. `` I think that my fate is completely bound up with the country where I was born, and I want to live there,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Thursday night before boarding a jet to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and a possible meeting with Polish Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The 67-year-old Nobel laureate also called for an international effort to aid victims of the massive earthquake that struck <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, killing tens of thousands of people. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Nov. 4 as a Soviet delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>, an organization formed this year by Soviet and American scientists to foster cooperation on arms control, hunger, pollution and other issues. During his stay, he visited relatives in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, attended a private dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He also underwent tests at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where doctors determined he did not need a heart pacemaker. It was <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s first visit to the West, and he and others hailed it as a symbol of change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Just by being able to make the trip he achieved a lot,'' said <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, Northeast regional director for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` He showed he could come and that Soviet security was not threatened as has always been argued.'' `` <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is a symbol for people who were persecuted from the late 1960s until the 1980s,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, professor of Soviet studies at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a sign to people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that it's now possible to protest official policies and still travel freely and move in high circles.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, previously was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific work. He was also restricted to the industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> for seven years because of his outspoken opposition to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In 1986, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> personally called him back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Since then, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has generally supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or political and economic restructuring, while speaking out against some trends, including the growing concentration of power in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hands.

<TEXT>
 Amid a hasty departure, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> paused to thank <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for its friendliness and speak optimistically of the prospects for world peace. `` The road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead, and we will _ I believe _ be building on what has been achieved if we act as we have been acting, and also maybe add something new,'' the Soviet leader said Thursday as he headed back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after a disastrous earthquake in the Soviet south. He flew out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> a day earlier than scheduled and canceled planned visits to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> because of the massive quake centered in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> that killed tens of thousands of people. Although his stay was brief _ 45 hours _ the communist leader dazzled world leaders with a dramatic troop reduction proposal and captured the hearts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION>, who gathered by the thousands along <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> streets to wave and cheer his speeding motorcade. The warm feelings were not lost on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who said the kind of hospitality he experienced showed an `` increasing friendliness and willingness to cooperate on the part of the Soviet people and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' `` We believe that this may have been one of the most important things that happened on this day of our stay in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said before leaving from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> explained his abrupt departure at an airport news conference, saying the quake, which registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, `` had extremely grave consequences, devastation and grave loss of life.'' Although he had only `` one working day'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` I and my delegation believe that this was a very important day.'' The highlights of the visit were <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that he planned a major reduction in Soviet troop strength over the next three years, and his superpower luncheon with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first Soviet chief to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 28 years, said his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech and a later reception gave him the opportunity to `` set out our views ... on the world today, and on the prospects of the world's development.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called the Governors Island session with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a good meeting, held in ... an open and trusting atmosphere.'' He said the one word he would use to characterize it was `` continuity'' and all parties walked away `` confident that our relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation, on the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later added, `` I think I would be remiss in my duty if I went home without saying how much we are grateful to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION>, for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they have been expressing over these days. ... We value that very much.'' He had planned to visit the first Soviet trade show in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum on Thursday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, canceled a visit with children at an <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> elementary school.

 A hometown holiday letter-writing campaign for <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> ended with more than 17,000 messages of support for the journalist, who has been held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for more than 3 -LCB- years, organizers say. `` We have encouraged prayers, we have encouraged letters ... we're getting letters from all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday at a school vigil marking completion of the drive. <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> said that although some people think <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will not see the letters, he believes they will be given to him. `` The world will be watching,'' <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> said. `` I think there's going to be some compassion shown. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, grew up in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>.

To mark the end of the mail drive, students from the King's Academy formed a human chain around the school in <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION> for a silent vigil for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> The vigil lasted four minutes, or one minute for every year he has been a captive. Most of the participants wore yellow, the color which has come to symbolize hope for a welcome home for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellerite </PERSON>, 15, of Olmsted Falls, said she hoped the vigil would encourage people to become concerned about <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s plight. The mail will be boxed this weekend and sent to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> through the efforts of Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said he has received mail in the past, often through a newspaper to which <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has access.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> expert on ancient <LOCATION> Assyria </LOCATION> and his church administrator wife have been charged with sexually assaulting two grandchildren, a prosecutor's spokesman said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a 64-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor of <LOCATION> Assyriology </LOCATION>, and his 61-year-old wife, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here, were to be arraigned today in <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` They expect to plead innocent,'' said their attorney, <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> <PERSON> Denniston </PERSON>. `` They are innocent and expect to be vindicated after vigorously contesting the charges.'' The charges were announced Thursday by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Samoluk </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office. The Morans are accused of sexually assaulting their grandchildren from June 1985 to June 1987, <PERSON> Samoluk </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> is charged with forcible rape of a child under 16 years old and indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 on various dates. <PERSON> Samoluk </PERSON> said the forcible part of the charge involved a sharp instrument and threats made to the children that their parents would be killed if they spoke of the abuse. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> is charged with rape and abuse of a child under 16 and indecent assault and battery of a child under 14.

<TEXT>
 A gynecologist charged by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> with gross immorality for allegedly performing sexual-enhancement surgery on women without their knowledge says he's eager to answer the charges. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> was cited Thursday with violating several provisions of the Medical Practices Act in 78 instances involving 33 patients dating to March 1966, said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubow </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the 12-member board. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, 67, also is being sued by two former patients who claim he performed sexual-enhancement surgery on them without their knowledge. In an interview with a <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> television station Thursday, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said he had not been notified by the medical board of the charges against him. `` I'm looking forward to answering whatever charges,'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WDTN-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel that when the truth comes out that I will be totally vindicated.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lubow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, who was banned by the board from surgical practice in November, has 30 days to seek a public hearing on the charges. Failing to do so `` would permit the board to construe those allegations as having been proven,'' she said. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> faces possible penalties ranging from reprimand to revocation of his license. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s techniques came under fire in October after CBS' `` West 57th Street'' program investigated his surgical procedures. That report and the medical board's citation also referred to <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s 1975 book, `` Surgery of Love,'' in which he admitted he had performed reconstructive surgery aimed at enhancing sexual pleasure without his patients' knowledge. In his book, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> wrote, `` One does n't have to go into the complexity of sexuality with the patient and her partner; one merely does the operation of coital area reconstruction. ... In many hundreds of these patients, the patient had not been informed that anything more had been done to her than delivery and episiotomy and repair.'' The board said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> conducted experimental surgeries that included rotation of the vagina away from the bladder and internal genitalia, and extension of the vagina to align it with the clitoris, an external tissue that responds to sexual stimulation. The procedures in many cases resulted in complications, complaints of sexual dysfunction, infection, a necessity for corrective surgery and chronic pain, the board said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the former captain of the USS Dubuque court-martialed for allegedly failing to rescue Vietnamese refugees who claim they later resorted to cannibalism, a spokesman said today. The spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON>, said no date had been set for the proceedings against Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but that they would probably be held at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was relieved of his duties in August after Vietnamese refugees claimed the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> failed to render assistance when their boat crossed paths with the warship in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 9. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials said 52 of the refugees later reached the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but 58 people died during the 37 day voyage. Survivors said two Vietnamese died of starvation but that three others were slain and eaten by fellow passengers. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, ordered the court-martial after reviewing findings of an investigation conducted at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>'s destination when it spotted the Vietnamese boat. The investigation, which corresponds to a civilian grand jury probe, was completed Oct. 28 and forwarded to <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> on Nov. 7, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said. It found that the Vietnamese vessel was out of food and water and with an inoperative engine and sails when it encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> claimed that the boat was seaworthy and that the crew provided food, water and navigational directions. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> faced seven charges, including failure to render assistance to a vessel in distress and failing to determine the condition of the vessel. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, who is now in <LOCATION> Sasabo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, could be dismissed from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and imprisoned for two years on each charge if convicted. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said the investigation determined that the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> failed to provide food, water and clothing, even though some of the refugees were naked, dehydrated, and weakened from their ordeal at sea. He said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was also charged with failing to rescue a Vietnamese refugee who jumped into the water and tried to swim to the port side of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said another Vietnamese tried to climb a rope ladder on the side of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, but the crew shook it and he fell back into the sea. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> also did not report the location of the Vietnamese vessel by radio so that other ships in the area could render assistance, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said. Quoting the report, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said the Vietnamese vessel left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on May 22. By the time it encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> on June 9, there were 83 men, women and children, including one infant, still alive, the report said.

 Israeli jets bombed guerrilla posts today and gunboats sent commando reinforcements ashore in what police said was a mission to rescue paratroopers captured after landing in this coastal town. Police and the Israeli military said one Israeli officer was killed and three soldiers were wounded in nine hours of air, naval and ground fighting about 50 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. It was believed to be the deepest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> incursion into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since September 1983, during the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war. The Israelis did not say why they launched a paratrooper raid on the town. Police said eight pro-Syrian guerrillas were killed and 16 wounded. The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the apparent target of the attack, said only two of its fighters were killed and six wounded. It claimed in a communique that it was holding 17 Israelis and that another <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> was held by Syrian troops. Police and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military sources said four Israelis were trapped at one point in the fighting but were rescued. The Israeli army said no <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were left behind when the fighting ended. Lebanese police said Syrian troops fired at attacking Israeli jets and sent troop reinforcements to the embattled areas, but they said there was no evidence the troops were directly involved in the ground combat. The fighting, which police said involved hand-to-hand combat, raged for nine hours near an abandoned Maronite Catholic monastry above <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, nine miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Palestinian guerrillas ambushed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> force of about 50 paratroopers who landed helicopters in a ravine below the monastry at 2:10 a.m., one police spokesman in <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> said. Militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> joined the battle an hour later, police said. Israeli warplanes then thundered in from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, blasting guerrilla posts above <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> in at least 20 sorties. The Israeli military said an unspecified number of guerrilla command posts and other targets were destroyed. Guerrillas fired shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, known as <PERSON> Strellas </PERSON>, at the raiding jets, but no hits were scored, police said. They said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pilots released hot air balloons to deflect the heat-seeking missiles. Convoys of Syrian military trucks and armored personnel carriers rolled southward, into the embattled areas on the coastal highway after Israeli reinforcements stormed ashore about 10 a.m. in landing craft two miles south of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>. There was no evidence the Syrian troops were involved in the actual combat. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, however, quoted Lebanese sources as saying Syrians opened fire on Israeli troops as they landed on the coast but stopped firing once the force was fully ashore. Israeli gunboats cruised off <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> and five helicopter gunships hovered overhead, apparently waiting to evacuate the paratroopers, the spokesman said. Palestinian guerrillas and the leftist Lebanese militiamen were seen firing at the helicopters from jeep-mounted, anti-aircraft guns along <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>'s beach. The spokesman said the dead Israeli officer commanded the reconnaissance battalion of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Golani </ORGANIZATION> brigade, an elite infantry force that undertakes most of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s special anti-guerrilla operations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Israeli military officials identified him as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Meital </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, on the capital's southern edge, was closed and incoming flights were diverted to airports in nearby <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the Moslem cabinet of the country's dual government, instructed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to lodge a complaint at the world body against `` this flagrant Israeli aggresssion,'' his press office said. The area where the fighting occurred is controlled by the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from the stricken bluffs to the coastal highway. They were believed rushing casualties to hospitals in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as the planes staged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 24th air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundreds of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> residents scurried to take shelter in basements. At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 23 previous air raids on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Jan. 3. The last major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> incursion into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was May 2, when a force of about 1,500 Israeli troops and allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> conducted a two-day sweep into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Three Israeli soldiers and 40 guerrillas were killed in the operation, the first time a large Israeli force had pushed beyond the six-to-10 mile deep border security zone since February 1986.

 Actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Soul </PERSON> and a former TV news anchorwoman testified that an ex-policeman convicted of a contract murder was warm, insightful and great with kids. Soul, who starred in the TV show `` Starsky and <PERSON> Hutch </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, a former anchorwoman at <ORGANIZATION> KABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, spoke on behalf of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Villas </PERSON> during the penalty phase of the former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officer's trial. Von Villas could face the death penalty. Miss <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> called Von Villas an `` insightful human being ... who has immense good in him.'' Soul described <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Villas </PERSON> as a `` loving, warm person who is great with kids.'' Von Villas, 44, of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was convicted last month of murder and conspiracy to murder. He was charged with killing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Weed </PERSON>, 52, in 1983 in exchange for $ 20,000 from Weed's former wife. Weed's body has never been found Jurors can recommend that Von Villas be sentenced to death or life in prison without possibility of parole. Another former police officer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, 48, was convicted Oct. 11 of the same charges in Weed's slaying, but his jury was unable to reach a decision on his punishment. The district attorney's office has n't decided whether to retry the penalty phase of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s case to seek the death penalty. Without a retrial, a judge could sentence <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to life in prison with or without the possibility of parole. Miss <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> testified Wednesday that she met <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Villas </PERSON> when he was on patrol near her <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION> home. She said they became friends, mainly because both were interested in the problems of children.

<HEAD>Cancer Remains No. 2 Cause Of Premature Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cancer rates are declining, but the disease remains the second leading cause of premature death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. In 1985, the last year for which statistics were available, cancer accounted for the loss of 1.95 million years of `` potential life'' Americans would have had if they had lived to age 65, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday in its weekly report. Only injuries, with a loss of 2.2 million years, ranked higher. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> counts `` years of potential life lost'' to various causes as a way of measuring premature mortality, using age 65 as a statistical benchmark. The actual life expectancy is higher. Since 1968, the mortality rate from cancer for Americans under 55 has dropped significantly, from 43 deaths per 100,000 people in that age group in 1968 to 35 in 1985. Over that same time, the annual rate of potential life years lost has fallen as well, from 1,074 years lost among every 100,000 people to 926. `` All of that leads to some guarded optimism _ that cancer rates in younger people are, in fact, declining,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> cancer specialist. In the 1985 figures, the highest rate for potential-life years lost to cancer was among black males, at 1,208 years per 100,000 such people. Following were white males, 949; black females, 877; and white females, 841. But while proportionately fewer people are dying early of cancer, the population is growing _ particularly `` baby boomers,'' now ages 24-42. Thus, cancer's toll in the total number of `` years of potential life lost'' has remained virtually constant for two decades, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted. `` Understanding the basis and public health implications of this decline -LRB- in cancer death rates -RRB- requires further investigation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, noting that such efforts should include study of cancer incidence and survival among younger Americans. Additionally, <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON> said, researchers have another concern: With improvements in other areas of medicine, such as treatment of cardiovascular disease, Americans are living longer, so the cancer rate for people over 65 is increasing. `` It sounds simplistic, but it means they're living long enough to get cancer,'' he said.

 Palestinians marked the first year of their revolt against Israeli rule today by erecting roadblocks, burning tires and flying balloons with the colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag. Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> following Moslem noon prayers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. All 650,000 residents of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were confined to their homes under a military curfew imposed Thursday night following scattered daytime clashes. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, streets were virtually deserted, but the stench of tires set ablaze in protest permeated the air. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, a prayer leader at the main mosque interrupted his sermon to announce Israeli casualties today in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos attacked a pro-Syrian Palestinian guerrilla base. `` I have good news for you,'' the Moslem cleric told worshipers. `` An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier has been killed.'' An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> announcement, delayed for several hours until the fighting ended, said combined naval, air and ground forces attacked the bases of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. Throughout the occupied territories, businesses were shuttered and transportation was halted for a second straight day in observance of a PLO-ordered general strike to mark the anniversary of the revolt, which has claimed the lives of 320 Palestinians and 11 Israelis since Dec. 8, 1987. Dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags flew in the open-air market of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, and residents released balloons in the colors of the outlawed flag, Palestinian reports said. Slogans painted on the walls of the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp declared: `` Happy New Year to the Intefadeh,'' which means uprising in Arabic. Palestinian demonstrators clashed with troops in the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fara </PERSON> refugee camps near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> following noon prayers. Hospital officials said four Palestinians were wounded, including a 22-year-old man shot in the mouth. The army said it was checking the reports. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, four Israeli cars were burned overnight, and police discovered a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag nearby, a police spokesman said. A note written in Hebrew in support of the uprising also was found, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Two left-wing legislators said in a report today that the uprising has become institutionalized and is `` gaining in strength'' contrary to army predictions. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> of the Citizens' Rights Movement charged that the 70,000 Jewish settlers living in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> had become `` a garrison force'' seldom called to answer for their `` wild deeds.'' According to the report, published in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, 16 Palestinians have been killed by settler gunfire during the uprising. The report also accused the army of doing little to punish troops who violated standing orders on the treatment of Palestinians. It said 600 cases of alleged violations had been opened, but only 20 soldiers brought to trial. The army recently said it has carried out 45 courts martial and 15 soldiers were given jail terms up to a year.

 Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials ate rum cake with frosting missiles in a party marking the first anniversary of the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty. `` Do n't let anybody carry that cake outside,'' one partygoer said Wednesday, joking about <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s liquor laws. `` We could get busted.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers today said the enormous changes under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offer an unprecedented opportunity for improved international relations. `` We will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the search for political solutions to <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> differences,'' the ministers in a statement ending a two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But they also urged `` tangible and lasting changes'' from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help solve the problems dividing East and West. The statement cited the announcement Wednesday by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the Soviets will unilaterally reduce their armed forces by 500,000 troops, or nearly 10 percent, and withdraw some conventional weapons from eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The move would still leave the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact with more conventional weapons and troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stressed again that the allies must maintain a strong defense effort even in the wake of the Soviet initiatives. `` Being encouraged does n't mean that you just go bananas and forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the things that are constructive,'' he told a news conference. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who has met with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and elsewhere over 6 -LCB- years on the job, was attending his last alliance session. `` The alliance, it seems to me, is in a very strong position,'' he said. `` It's cohesive, it's informed about what is taking place.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, `` We can not base our security on the good or bad intentions or personality of the Soviet leaders.'' `` We look upon Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with sympathy and encourage his reform efforts ... while they lead to more human rights and a more responsible conduct of foreign affairs and a reduction in military capability,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the ministers said, `` represents the starting point of a new approach by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the size and structure of their military forces and programs.'' Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the British secretary of state for foreign affairs, said the speech was filled with `` realism and good sense.'' `` It does offer up encouraging prospects for seeking new solutions to old problems,'' he told reporters. The officials said in their statement they welcomed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s move `` This implicitly acknowledges our long-held view that redressing the conventional imbalance is the key to more security and stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The carrying out of these measures, the statement said, `` would be a very important first step in this direction and reduce, but not eliminate,'' the imbalances in conventional forces. The implementation of the cuts, it said, `` would provide a very favorable impetus to the conventional stability negotiations.'' The ministers on Thursday unveiled their position for the <ORGANIZATION> Conventional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talks </ORGANIZATION>, due to begin early next year in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The talks will cover the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> told reporters that after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech `` the climate for the conventional negotations has considerably improved. Much needs to happen but things are looking up.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made his surprise announcement a day before the ministers were scheduled to meet at NATO headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. In their final statement, the ministers said their talks took place `` amid clear signs of change in the internal and external policies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and of some of its allies.'' `` Promising prospects are opening up for an improved East-West dialogue,'' it said. `` We are encouraged by this trend which, if sustained, would provide us with an unprecedented opportuity to shape a better international environment reflecting our basic values and the aspirations of our peoples,'' the statement said. In a separate statement, the ministers addressed <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> trade, saying it must contribute `` to constructive East-West relations -LRB- and -RRB- remain consistent with broad allied security concerns.'' It said trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies must be based on commercially sound terms and mutual advantage. Preferential treatment must be avoided, it said. It also cautioned against economic help that will improve the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military strength.

<HEAD>Fatal Beating At Church Camp Described</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OREGON CITY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 8-year-old girl was beaten as many as 500 times, slammed against a wall and dropped on the pavement the night she died at a church camp, one of four people accused in the death told authorities. The girl, <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, hid in a corner but the beatings continued with a hose after a plastic pipe and bamboo cane broke, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28, told a deputy sheriff. The girl was the daughter of <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that ran the camp at a rural house southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> also ran the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A tape of an interview <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> gave to the deputy the day after the girl's Oct. 14 death was played Thursday before <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who is considering pre-trial defense motions to suppress information the defendants provided authorities. Charged with manslaughter in the girl's death are <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 30, <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35. Defense lawyers allege in their motion to suppress the information that the defendants were not properly advised of their rights. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> made no decision and said the hearing would continue Monday. The judge said he was delaying the start of the defendants' trial until Feb. 6. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> also released <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON> on their own recognizance. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Chambers were released in mid-November. On the tape, <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> told how he came to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> a few days before the child's death to work at the camp. When he arrived, <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> had been a problem and they would have to discipline her. He said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told him the child had stolen some pieces of chicken she was not supposed to have. <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> said the beating began Oct. 13 when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pushed the girl against a wall three to five times, after which the girl said she was having trouble seeing and was dizzy. <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON> held the girl down while <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> beat her repeatedly with a leather strap, a bamboo cane and a plastic pipe. Some 250 to 500 blows were delivered, <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> said. He said the girl also was taken outside and dropped on the pavement three to five times. At one point she tried to run and hide in a corner. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> then beat her with three extension cords braided together. Authorities said the beating lasted about 90 minutes. The child later was taken to a fire station, where a firefighter tried to administer first aid. After the girl's death, the state took custody of 53 children living at the camp. Officials said the children were systematically beaten.

<TEXT>
 Officials today revised the death toll from the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION> to five after discovering that a postman counted among the dead was hospitalized with severe burns. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military refused to speculate on the cause of the crash Thursday and opened an investigation. However, the West German air force chief of staff, <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Jungkurth </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> he believed the crash was caused by human error. He said the A-10 aircraft was known as highly reliable and that the chances of a technical problem were `` not very high.'' He said, `` The pilot may have become disoriented when he tried to climb in heavy cloud cover.'' Witnesses said the plane flew low over a school and struck the top floor of an apartment building before bursting into flames. Black smoke billowed from the crash site in this central city of 130,000 today. Burned-out cars lined the street. For more than a block, many buildings were either destroyed or heavily damaged. The Remscheid city spokesman, <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbrake </PERSON>, told reporters officials mistakenly reported that six people died in the crash because they were not aware that the postman was moved to a hospital in neighboring Bochum. <PERSON> Ellerbrake </PERSON> identified the five dead as the lone pilot of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane, two women, aged 86 and 76, and two men, aged 35 and 30. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> identified the pilot as Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 34. It did not give his hometown. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a civil defense official in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Westphalia </LOCATION> state, said workers were searching for more victims. At least 40 people were treated and released, but 11 remained hospitalized from injuries. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Major Gen. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the pilot of the A-10 Thunderbolt II jet had reported in a last radio transmission 14 minutes after leaving the West German air base at <LOCATION> Norvenich </LOCATION> that he had run into bad weather. `` He was trying to get out of it by moving up. That was the last transmission,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said today. `` In the course of doing so -LRB- climbing -RRB-, the mishap aircraft did not come out from the top of the clouds and continued in a descent and ultimately crashed. We do not know why,'' he said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigation team was trying to determine the cause of the crash, but said the probe could take up to 30 days to complete. He said the plane was fully loaded with 1,800 gallons of fuel. Asked about eyewitness reports that one of the plane's two jet engines was on fire before it crashed, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said: `` Witnesses sometimes become confused.'' He also apologized for what he said was a delay in notifiying local authorities that the aircraft was carrying ammunition. `` That is standard procedure to notify authorities as quickly as possible. We did have some delay and we regret that very much. We will investigate what the cause was,'' he said. There are no plans to ground the A-10 aircraft unless investigators determine it had a technical problem, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Before Thursday's crash, 12 military accidents this year had claimed 95 lives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it was suspending all tactical training flights in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until Tuesday. The West German air force suspended low-level training flights until the end of the year and called on its allies to do the same. Opposition political parties called for a ban on low-level flights and sharp cuts in air exercises. Opposition to low-level flying grew in August when Italian stunt planes collided and crashed into a crowd of spectators at an air show at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. Seventy people were killed.

<HEAD>Excerpts From The NATO Communique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the official English-language communique issued by the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers Friday at the end of their two-day meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters: Our meeting has taken place amid clear signs of change in the internal and external policies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and of some of its allies. Promising prospects are opening up for an improved East-West dialogue. We are encouraged by this trend which, if sustained, would provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to shape a better international environment reflecting our basic values and the aspirations of our peoples. Among the most promising recent developments is the address made by President -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the 43rd <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which indicates the extend of change in Soviet policies. We will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the search for political solutions to <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> differences, with a view to promoting our ultimate aim of a just and lasting peaceful order in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In the pursuit of this endeavor, we look for further tangible and lasting changes addressing directly the issues dividing East and West. We reiterate our willingness to work closely with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies in the search for ways to ease and finally overcome the painful division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We will continue to evaluate closely the current developments in <LOCATION> eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where pressures for movement toward political and economic reform are mounting. While welcoming progress achieved in certain areas, we need to take a realistic view of developments. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Eastern countries still have to meet fully their obligations on human rights. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the recent introduction or announcement of important measures in this field. In the defense area we express the hope that President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address also represents the starting point of a new approach by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the size and structure of their military forces and programs, which both in the nuclear and conventional fields still exceed any reasonable defense need. -- - We attach particular importance to the <ORGANIZATION> CSCE </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- process, which provides a road map for stable and constructive relations between East and West and for a dynamic evolution in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We note with regret that a number of governments in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> still continue to ignore important provisions of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act and the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Concluding Document; full implementation of the undertakings contained in these documents, including full respect for human rights, is an essential requirement for genuine peace and enhancement of mutual confidence. We will continue to strive for the conclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> CSCE </ORGANIZATION> Follow-Up meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in the immediate future, with a substantial and balanced concluding document. Arms control is an integral part of Alliance security policy. In expressing full support for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> position in the START -LRB- Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -RRB- negotiations, i.e. its aim to reach a 50 percent reduction in the strategic nuclear forces of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we welcome the substantial progress achieved, including preliminary agreement on key elements, and look forward to a timely, successful conclusion of these negotiations. We reaffirm the importance of the INF -LRB- Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -RRB- Treaty and welcome its smooth implementation. -- - We look forward to beginning as soon as possible conventional stability negotiations, within the framework of the CSCE process, with the objective of establishing a secure and stable balance of forces at lower levels, between the 23 members of the two military alliances in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We want a situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which force postures, as well as numbers and deployments of weapons systems, no longer make a surprise attack and a large-scale offensive action a feasible option, an option which we have never possessed or desired. Our vision remains a continent where military forces should only exist to prevent war and to ensure self-defense, not for the purpose of military aggression and not for the purposes of political or military intimidation. We therefore welcome the latest pronouncement by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership regarding significant reductions of Soviet conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and re-structuring of the remaining forces. This implicitly acknowledges our long-held view that redressing the conventional imbalance is a key to more security and stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Implementation of these measures would be a very important first step in this direction and reduce, but not eliminate, the conventional imbalances. In particular, it would provide a very favorable impetus to the conventional stability negotiations. The conventional stability talks will be accompanied by distinct negotiations on further confidence-building measures among the 35 <ORGANIZATION> CSCE </ORGANIZATION> participants. Such negotiations will have to build upon and expand on the results of the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which marked a significant step toward increasing transparency and contributed to greater confidence and predictability of military activities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We look to the countries of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and other participating states to reciprocate this effort. -- - The member states participating in the MBFR -LRB- Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction -RRB- talks emphasize their agreement to the continuation of these talks until a new mandate for negotiations on conventional stability has emerged. They also agreed these talks should be concluded before the start of new negotiations. We reiterate our full commitment to the goal of an early conclusion of a truly worldwide, comprehensive and effectively verifiable ban on chemical weapons. -- - We reaffirm our commitment to share fairly the risks, burdens and responsibilities, as well as the benefits, of our participation in the alliance. This commitment to equitable sharing is a fundamental principle of the alliance and a prerequisite for maintaining its cohesion and solidarity. We all attach great importance, in an evolving political, trade and economic environment to maintaining balance and equity in our partnership.

 Armenian immigrants flooded telephone lines in mostly futile attempts to learn whether their kin survived the catastrophic Soviet earthquake, while Armenian-American organizations pressed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to begin relief flights today. Throughout the country, Armenian-Americans continued to mobilize swift relief efforts for survivors of the quake that killed tens of thousands and devastated several cities in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where the nation's largest Armenian-American community resides, a relief plane was to leave today for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where it was to pick up additional supplies and depart for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovnanian </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for Armenian religious and community organizations. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> clearance was given, but approval from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had n't been obtained late Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Hovnanian </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are optimistic,'' he said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is a humane, Christian mission.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hovnanian </ORGANIZATION> said he feared <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was withholding its permission for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relief flights because of the ethnic unrest plaguing the Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` The Soviet government may fear this situation may give opportunity for some -LRB- American -RRB- Armenians to become politically involved.'' But, he added, `` The size of the devastation is so big they should welcome all help.'' Two Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> doctors said they were flying to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> team to spend up to 10 days lending support. Dr. <PERSON> Garo </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tertzakian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Vartkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescenta </ORGANIZATION> hoped to arrive in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Saturday. Many churches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> planned special services Sunday for quake victims. `` We've been receiving phone calls all day from people who want to know what they can do to help,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Arnak </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparian </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tenafly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000 people died in Wednesday's earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cut short his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort in the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, which has a population of 3.3 million. `` The immediate needs are shelter, medical supplies, clothing and blood,'' Archbishop <PERSON> Torkom </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoogian </PERSON>, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said at a news conference at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Armenian cathedral. <PERSON> Manoogian </PERSON> and a delegation of Armenian prelates from around the world held the news conference after a one-hour meeting with Soviet officials at the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. As news of the quake's magnitude spread, the nation's Armenian communities struggled to contact relatives in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't reach <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bursalyan </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Armenian biweekly, Paros. `` All of the phone lines are shot. Our only information is American television.'' <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulukhyia </PERSON>, a Soviet exchange student at <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, did get through to her parents. She said the earthquake had spared her family. `` I talked with my parents and I asked, ` Is it true or not?' and they answered that it was a very hard earthquake,'' <PERSON> Sulukhyia </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, himself of Armenian descent, offered his sympathy. `` Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this very difficult time,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. `` As Californians, we are all too familiar with devastating earthquakes.'' In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the Western Prelacy of the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> announced eight days of mourning would begin today, and that local Armenian churches would hold special requiem services today and Sunday. `` They are in a state of shock,'' Archbishop <PERSON> Datev </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkissian </PERSON> said. `` They are in a state of grief and great pain.'' <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is home to at least 250,000 Armenians, the largest concentration outside of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Most local Armenians reside in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where many of the state's estimated 90,000 Armenians live, the first feeling to sweep the community was despair, said <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalaydjian </PERSON>, editor of the Armenian Mirror Spectator. `` But now it's changed into determination to build again and not for decades _ for centuries,'' <PERSON> Kalaydjian </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, local relief efforts got a strong boost from industrialist <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoogian </PERSON>, international president of the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, who contributed $ 500,000 for emergency medical supplies. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Azadian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manoogian </PERSON>'s chief assistant, said some Detroit-area Armenians were trying to fly to their homeland to personally check up on loved ones. `` Everybody is scrambling to charter airplanes and get permission from the Soviets to get there as soon as possible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pope Condemns Terrorists Who Claim To Speak For Minorities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> urged today that the rights of minorities be respected, but he also condemned any recourse to violence to advance their claims and lashed out at terrorist groups acting in their name. `` May those who follow the inhuman path of terrorism hear my voice: to strike blindly, kill innocent people or carry out bloody reprisals does not help a just evaluation of the claims advanced by the minorites for whom they claim to act,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in his message for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s World Day of Peace. The message, sent to world leaders each year, was titled `` To Build Peace, Respect Minorities.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said the message was in general terms and that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had no specific ethnic, racial, religious or national group in mind, although his words seemed directed at a number of situations in the world. The pope acknowledged that `` delicate problems arise'' when a group seeks independence or greater political autonomy. `` I wish to state that, in such delicate circumstances, dialogue and negotiation are the obligatory path to peace,'' he said, adding that a refusal to enter into dialogue `` can open the door to violence.'' He also declared that states that perpetrate or tolerate acts aimed at endangering the lives of minorities, violate `` the fundamental law governing the social order.'' In situations of real injustice, he said it may be the duty of groups which have emigrated to demand justice for oppressed in their homelands. But he called for care `` especially when it is difficult to have objective information.'' The church marks its World Day of Peace on Jan. 1 but the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s message is traditionally issued in advance

<HEAD>Soweto City Council Drops Campaign To Crush Rent Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city council of the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> has agreed to halt evictions and write off arrears stemming from a massive, 3-year-old rent boycott, prominent anti-apatheid activists said today. The activists, who met with the council for several hours, included Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, miners' union leader <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON> and others who in the past have refused to negotiate with the black councilors of the township near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The rent boycott, launched to press a broad range of grievances against the government, has evolved into one of the most effective forms of protest still available to blacks under a 30-month-old state of emergency. Authorities have used numerous tactics in futile attempts to break the boycott, including late-night eviction raids such as one in August 1986 which led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a confrontation with police. The new council took office following nationwide municipal elections Oct. 26 which were the target of an illegal but successful boycott by blacks. About 11.5 percent of eligible voters in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> cast ballots. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority is excluded from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and black local councils have been denounced by activists as subordinate extensions of the white-dominated political system. The new council, seeking to differentiate itself from its predecessor, proceeded to rehire municipal workers fired during a strike and said it wanted to consult with community leaders to resolve problems facing the township of 2.5 million people. Today's meeting came two days after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s highest court ruled that previous <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> councils had no legal authority to collect rent from occupants of the thousands of homes built in the 1940s and 1950s by the city council of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. At that time, there was no separate black administration in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches and leader of the activists' delegation, said the councilors agreed that because of the court ruling, no Sowetan was required to pay any of the millions of dollars of rent withheld during the boycott. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said further negotiations would take place to determine whether some residents should now be awarded ownership of their houses and what type of rent or service charges should be paid in the future. In the interim, he said, residents should not pay any rent. The rent boycott was launched in townships south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> in 1985 and spread to dozens of communities nationwide. Overdue rent in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> alone is believed to exceed $ 100 million. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> indicated the new council was viewed more positively by activists than its predecessors. `` They told us our grievances were their grievances,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. The activists said in a statement that negotiations with the council would continue only if it were able to guarantee community leaders were not harassed or detained as they consulted with residents. One of the consequences of the five-month municipal workers' strike was an accumulation of trash on roadsides throughout <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> The council will launch a clean-up campaign Saturday, and it drew praise from the normally critical local newspaper, The Sowetan, for a proposal to pay children to join the effort.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locust-spraying plane was shot down near where Marxist rebels have been fighting <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> for an independent <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, and officials said all five people aboard were presumed killed. A second DC-7, also from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, was damaged in Thursday's anti-aircraft missile attack over <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> but was able to land at a remote airstrip in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. No one aboard that plane was injured. Marxist guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> may have fired at the four-engine propeller-driven planes, official sources in this North African country said on condition of anonymity. The guerrillas are known to have been armed with Soviet-made SA-6 and SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. Both the Moroccan and Mauritanian armed forces also have such anti-aircraft missiles. No one immediately claimed responsibility, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION> said an investigation was under way. `` The five crew members of the downed aircraft, all of whom are American citizens, are presumed dead,'' an AID statement from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. Both aircraft were owned by <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G Aviation of <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and were under contract to AID to spray insects, said <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G co-owner <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON>, who was in the other plane that was hit. <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON>, 64, spoke with reporters by telephone from his hotel room in <LOCATION> Agadir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. He identified those aboard the downed plane as <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 21, both of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>, 49, <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hederman </PERSON>, 47, <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON> did not know <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s age or hometown. <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON> described the two-hour trip in the crippled plane to the next airfield as `` hairy.'' `` We were just flying along at about 11,000 feet when, all of a sudden, the first airplane was hit,'' <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON> said. `` We saw the smoke and a big ball of fire. One of the engines was in flames. The plane started losing altitude, and then the right wing blew off. I knew they were in trouble, but we had problems of our own.'' `` We were 25 to 30 feet above the ground most of the way. We had a load of insecticide aboard, and we dumped it and were able to gain some altitude,'' <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON> added. `` We made an emergency landing at an airfield in a town about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> Agadir </LOCATION>.'' A caller identifying himself as <PERSON> Madjid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the front `` will do everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and unfortunate incident. `` We are not sure really who shot it down,'' he said in a phone call to The Associated Press in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The Polisario Front has no interest in creating problems with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> must assume responsibility for the attack because it directed civilian planes over an area with a `` huge concentration'' of Polisario troops. The area where the plane was shot down is 650 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>, the Moroccan capital. The DC-7s were used for spraying locust swarms in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> to the south, AID spokesman <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Kull </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Locust infestations have ravaged much of northern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year. The planes left <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, earlier Thursday and were bound for <ORGANIZATION> Agadir </ORGANIZATION> when they came under fire from ground-to-air missiles, the embassy spokesman said. Moroccan government officials said the two planes were attacked while they were flying at an altitude of 10,000 to 11,000 feet in an international navigation corridor over <PERSON> Bir </PERSON> <PERSON> Moghrein </PERSON>, northern <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. The Moroccan sources said officials were trying to locate the downed plane's wreckage, which they said could have scattered over a wide area. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> lies east of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, a former Spanish colony. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> annexed part of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> in 1976 and the remaining territory three years later, when <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> withdrew from it. For 13 years, the desolate border region has been the scene of a guerrilla war waged by the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to establish an independent <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is mediating talks between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the rebels. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON> said his agency was checking to see if it might have jurisdiction to investigate. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorist Act, which made it a crime for any terrorist group to assault or kill an American anywhere in the world.

 A former television preacher's allegations that he had sex with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> are `` lies'' from a `` former good friend,'' <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says.

Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> agreed to appear on the show after <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> promised not to do a planned show with <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubrow </PERSON>, executive producer of the `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>.'' The interview with Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will be aired Dec. 19. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, who appeared on `` The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' from the mid-1970s to 1981, said in an interview for January's Penthouse magazine: `` I was <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s male prostitute.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was indicted this week on federal charges of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy, has denied in a sworn deposition that he has ever had a homosexual relationship, and has denied charges of financial wrongdoing. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 after admitting he had a sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paying her hush money. With her husband watching the taping on a tiny monitor in the driveway outside the couple's leased 14-room log cabin, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> talked about the pain she has suffered during the past two years, including being humiliated when people at shopping malls and restaurants ridiculed her and her husband. `` Sometimes I wish we could just move away to another planet,'' she said tearfully.

 Nobel laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> today called for more steps to reduce the size of the Soviet military and appealed for massive help for the victims of the earthquake in the Armenian republic. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, arriving to attend a celebration marking the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said one way to cut down the Soviet military would be to limit the length of service for Soviet draftees. Commenting on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer Wednesday to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by 500,000 men and withdraw thousands of tanks and troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said it was a major decision but only a beginning. The human rights activist and nuclear physicist said reductions in manpower and weapons `` can be done and will change in a major way the international situation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is going in this direction and this is very important. I would have liked to see bigger cuts but what was done is important.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, spoke at a 90-minute news conference at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION>. He twice sidestepped questions about the political implications of a meeting he is expected to have with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today to attend the anniversary celebration. Speaking about Wednesday's devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said volunteers were needed from all over the world to help victims. He said he was certain Soviet authorities would welcome all the help they could get. `` All other things have to take second place,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said, including the ethnic unrest between Armenian and the neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> republic that has forced an estimated 180,000 people to flee the two republics. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a founder of the Soviet dissident movement, talked at length about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political and economic restructuring, known as `` perestroika,'' saying it `` can not yet be called irreversible.'' For the West, he said, the failure of perestroika would be dangerous. `` There will be a loss of internal stability in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and therefore of stability in the world because the pendulum would swing the other way in an expansionist direction,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. He said the West should support perestroika but not unconditionally. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he had been visiting relatives. He was to be joined tonight by his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, who was en route from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> invited the recent winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> won the prize in 1983, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in 1975. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will speak at the celebrations Saturday at the <LOCATION> Palais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chaillot </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is winding down its centennial year facing financial problems, with staff reductions planned and some book publications curtailed. The cutbacks were disclosed in a memo to staffers from <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, chairman of the society. <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said he would strive to make the staff reductions `` primarily through attrition and the transfer of regular staff members.'' Spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said today reductions are needed in the wake of a financial report showing a sharp decline in the society's year-end picture. The reductions could affect about 100 of the society's 2,500 workers, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Two children's book series will be affected by the cutbacks, Ms. <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said.. Books for World Explorers is being discontinued, she said A second series, Books for Young Explorers, will still be published, but the volumes offered will be reprints of `` classics'' from the past, she said, with no new one being developed for the time being. <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>'s memo Thursday noted that the society has employed a large number of people on special projects in recent years, and `` such personnel will normally be phased out as these activities are completed.'' Indications are that the society will complete 1988 about $ 2 million in the black, compared to a $ 29 million surplus last year. The society, which publishes <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, has had large expenses this year, including a major effort to improve geography education, expenses for its birthday celebration and a costly holographic cover _ a three-dimensional representation produced with a laser _ on its December magazine. In addition, <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said in his memo that direct mail promotion seems to have reached a saturation point for society membership. And the nation's demographics are changing, he pointed out. The decline in the nation's birth rate has reduced the audience for some society publications aimed at children, for example.

 A cancer researcher visiting his 3-year-old daughter in state custody sprayed a Mace-like substance at four social workers and abducted the girl, police said. Warrants have been issued charging <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 48, with aggravated battery and interfering with child custody and accusing his wife, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Denmark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 21, with custody interference, said police Capt. <PERSON> S.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>. The child was taken into protective custody after <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, was accused by the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of misconduct toward her, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. HRS spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> declined to elaborate on the case because such records are confidential. He said the girl had been in state custody for more than a week. Social worker <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was supervising the couple's visit Thursday when Mrs. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the child's stepmother, excused herself only seconds before a fire alarm sounded, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said Employees from an alarm company were working on the system and activated it as a test. Not realizing the alarm was being tested, state workers began filing outside. When <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, his daughter and Ms. Chambers reached a first-floor landing, the social worker told him he could not leave the building with the girl, officials said. `` Then the father sprayed a substance such as <PERSON> Mace </PERSON> into the face of the counselor and ran out of the building with the child,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. Three other child care workers standing nearby also were sprayed. All four were treated and released at a hospital. The Stewarts were seen driving off in a car with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> license plates.

 Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> is responding to treatment for pneumonia and may miss only one court session, a court spokeswoman said today. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arberg </PERSON>, the spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> `` is continuing to improve and is resting comfortably.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, at 82 the oldest member of the court, was taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> on Thursday after visiting a doctor at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION>, court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said. `` Justice <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> was admitted with pneumonia,'' she said. `` He is being treated with antibiotics, and doctors expect him to respond very well.'' Ms. <PERSON> House </PERSON> added, `` His illness is not expected to affect his work except for the Monday, Dec. 12, session.'' The court is scheduled to begin a four-week recess after issuing orders and possibly announcing decisions Monday. Ms. <PERSON> House </PERSON> declined to answer other questions concerning the justice's health or his hospitalization. A spokesman for the medical center would confirm that <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> is a patient there but declined to offer any information about his condition. A court employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> left his court office in the early afternoon, suffering from a fever and the chills. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> participated in the court's oral arguments Wednesday, and reportedly has enjoyed good health recently. His last hospitalization occurred in August 1987 when he checked into the Mayo Clinic in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, for tests on his prostate gland. The tests revealed he did not have cancer. `` Although the prostate is somewhat enlarged, the condition is not malignant and no surgery is required,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in a statement issued by the court at that time. In 1979 <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> had a stroke that left his right hand partially paralyzed, and a year earlier he was treated for a cancerous growth on a vocal cord. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, appointed to the nation's highest court by President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1956, is its oldest and most senior member. For three decades the court's leading liberal light, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> is now one of three liberal, octogenarian justices. <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> are 80. By comparison, the average age of the court's conservative justices is about 60. Such demographics have fueled speculation about President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s impact over the next four years on a court deeply divided over such politically explosive issues as abortion and affirmative action. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices are appointed to life terms by the president. The appointments must win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager accused of slaying his parents, brother and sister with an ax must be tried as an adult because of public safety concerns, the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices unanimously affirmed a ruling of the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in the case of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. The ruling said the state had `` met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that D.F.B. -LRB- Brom -RRB- is unamenable to treatment in the juvenile court system consistent with the public safety.'' A lower court judge had ruled that Brom should be tried as a juvenile. Brom is accused of killing his parents, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, both 41; his sister, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, 13, and a brother, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11. The bodies were found Feb. 18 in the family's home north of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. Each had died of multiple blows with an ax, authorities said. Brom was 16 at the time of the slayings. He turned 17 on Oct. 3. The <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the lower court judge had misinterpreted the effect of a 1980 amendment to juvenile criminal justice law. The <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided that keeping <LOCATION> Brom </LOCATION> in the juvenile court system was inconsistent with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s intent. `` There can be no doubt that the offenses here are heinous and that the only fair response of the criminal justice system, as a matter of law, must be referral'' to adult court, the <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said. Brom was arrested Feb. 19 and has been undergoing treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a facility for severely disturbed children. If found guilty in juvenile court, he would have been subject to state custody until his 19th birthday. A conviction of first-degree murder in adult court carries a mandatory life sentence, with eligibility for parole after 17 -LCB- years.

<HEAD>Report: Significant Weaknesses In New York Subway's Emergency
Preparedness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An inspection prompted by last year's fatal <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway fire found many weaknesses in fire safety precautions and emergency preparedness in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s subways. Eleven of the subway system's 48 escalators lack sprinklers, about one quarter of the token booths inspected have inadequate emergency communications equipment and about half the fire extinguishers that are supposed to be along the tracks are missing or empty, according to a report on the inspection released Thursday. The fire in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground, which killed 31 people, began when someone dropped a lighted match on a wooden escalator. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway system does not have wooden escalator treads. After the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fire, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> reactivated an old contract to install sprinklers at all 48 escalators at a cost of $ 5.7 million, but a month later called off the project because of budget concerns. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway system has not had a fire like the one at King's Cross Station in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but it averages 5,000 blazes a year, mostly minor car and track fires caused by rubbish. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for rapid transit, said that since the audit, his agency has made safety improvements and plans more. The audit found 11 of the subway system's escalators are not equipped with sprinklers and warned that inadequate cleaning allows flammable debris and grease to build up beneath them. There have been three escalator fires in the past five years, two in escalators without sprinklers. Both apparently were sparked by cigarettes, although smoking is illegal in the subway system. Since the audit, the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has intensified its escalator maintenance, <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> said. The audit also found that of the 118 token booths checked, 28 had neither a working emergency communication system nor a substitute auxiliary phone. These systems are used to contact the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> command center, which is responsible for calling the Fire Department. <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> said an $ 11.8 million contract to replace the transit booth communications systems has been awarded. <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> wrote in his response to the inspection that the authority is trying to deter thefts of fire extinguishers. `` Locking or otherwise securing extinguishers in the tunnels was deemed unacceptable,'' he said. `` Police stakeouts also are utilized. This situation is still being studied.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> today ordered the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> to hold hearings on a group of claims filed against the state after the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> fire that killed 165 people. The board had dismissed the claims without notice in 1987, saying it had the `` inherent'' power to do so and that it would not have been liable to the claimants, anyway. But the appeals court said in a precedent-setting opinion that the board and similar administrative agencies, unlike courts, `` have no ` inherent' powers.'' `` The Board of Claims is entirely a creature of the legislature. ... There is no explicit grant of authority -LRB- in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law -RRB- giving the board the power to take on an adversarial role and dismiss claims'' on its own motion, the court said in a 2-1 ruling. The board was created by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to handle damage claims against state agencies, which under the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Constitution can not be sued for negligence. The fire on May 28, 1977, led to years of litigation against dozens of companies that manufactured materials used in the construction or furnishing of the club at <LOCATION> Southgate </LOCATION>, just across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In July 1985, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> became the last of 14 defendants in a federal civil suit against aluminum wiring manufacturers to reach settlements totaling $ 14 million. Settlements by other defendants had totaled $ 30 million by 1984. The appeals court upheld <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier had consolidated the claims by the estates of seven people into a single case and ordered it back to the board for hearing. The board appealed that ruling. Failure to give the claimants notice of dismissal or to allow them to respond with legal arguments was a violation of the constitutional guarantee of due legal process, the appellate panel said.

 A 12-year-old stowaway who wanted to go to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> but ended up in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> by mistake arrived back in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> today at the end of a 19,000-mile airborne adventure. <PERSON> Kristofer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrowski </PERSON> was questioned by police and then handed back to his Polish-born mother, officials at <LOCATION> Schwechat </LOCATION> airport told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. His home address was not released. Airline officials were at a loss to explain the incident but said they were checking security systems. <PERSON> Dobrowski </PERSON> was put on a Vienna-bound plane in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> late Thursday after he was discovered in the transit lounge of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s airport without a ticket, travel papers or identity documents `` He is knee-high to a grasshopper,'' said one Australian immigration officer. `` It seems he wanted to go to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and mistook the <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> flight destination of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' With the help of an interpreter, officials found that <PERSON> Dobrowski </PERSON> had flown undetected from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, and on to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> before being picked up in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. Immigration spokesman <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said officials became suspicious when they realized the boy spoke no English, was traveling alone and had no travel documents. <PERSON> Dobrowski </PERSON>, who is Polish but lives with his mother in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, said he was unhappy at his mother's recent remarriage. He said he did not like his stepfather, so he decided to run away. `` He left home Saturday and went to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> where he somehow boarded an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauda </ORGANIZATION> jet for <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' said the spokesman. `` He stayed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for two days in the transit area, mostly sleeping while he recovered from his flight from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' When he overcame his jetlag, <PERSON> Dobrowski </PERSON> tagged along with a family that was flying to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, apparently managing to pick up a boarding pass he found on the ground and use it to join a flight to <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. `` But <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was n't <PERSON> Kristofer </PERSON>'s chosen destination. With his poor understanding of English, he mistook <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, which is where he really wanted to go _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said the official demanded anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> paid for him to stay the night at the Airport Hilton Hotel before putting him on a plane home _ as a first-class passenger.

<HEAD>For Reagan, Questions About the Same, But Answers Different</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held what is likely to be his last White House news conference, many of the reporters' questions sounded hauntingly like those at his first one, but many of the answers were different The first question when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met reporters on Jan. 29, 1981, was about relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the aftermath of the long captivity of American hostages that had ended on the day of his inaugration nine days before. He said then, `` I do n't know whether reconciliation would be possible with the present government, or absence of a government, in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' One of the last questions Thursday night was about relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as American hostages continue to be held by radical Moslem forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with whom the Iranians are believed to have influence. The president said, `` Anytime that they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them.'' The contrast between the two answers was one mark among many of the changes that nearly eight years in office have wrought on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. There is no fixed timetable for presidential news conferences, so this does not have to be the last before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office on Jan. 20. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to rule out the possibility of another. The first lady, however, beseeched reporters on Tuesday, `` Be nice. It's his last one.'' For his own part, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened the meeting with reporters by cracking, `` We've got to stop meeting like this.'' And when a reporter prefaced a question by saying that the session would be the president's last, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not demur. In any event, many of the questions and answers had a distinct tone of summing up. With <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fresh off his fifth meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it was inevitable that someone would remind him of his most famous words at the January 1981 session. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters then, `` I know of no leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the revolution, and including the present leadership, that has not more than once repeated ... their determination that their goal must be the promotion of world revolution.'' Furthermore, he said, the Soviet leaders `` have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that.'' Thursday night, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That was four leaders back before this one. I think there have been some changes.'' Asked directly whether he trusted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president said, `` He has n't shown me any reason yet why I should n't.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` to lie, to cheat'' line was one of many memorable phrases to come from his news conferences, an institution that took on an increasingly theatrical tone during the former actor's administration It was at a news conference on Feb. 21, 1985, that he said he was not advocating the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government, or at any rate `` not if the present government would turn around and say, ` all right,' if they'd say ` uncle.''' It was at a news conference on April 9, 1986, that he characterized <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> as `` this mad dog of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' And it was at a news conference on June 11, 1987, in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, that he said he thought the dollar could decline further `` within reason,'' at a time when his administration was trying to keep it from sliding at all. The first <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House news conference, like most in the early days of his administration, was held in a workmanlike auditorium in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. In mid-1982, the sessions were moved to the more ornate if less comfortable East Room on the glittering state floor of the executive residence. A further refinement was instituted in 1984. Instead of addressing reporters with his back to the east wall of the room, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> switched to the west side, giving him a chance to make an entrance down a hallway visible through an open door. `` Our people just got tired of seeing me in the same set,'' he cracked at the time. Thursday night, the entrance was even more dramatic than usual. Because of Christmas decorating at the White House, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could not pop out of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> as he usually does, but had to enter the hall from the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, which is farther away. Despite the changes in trappings, however, it was the flow of the news that set the tone of the news conferences _ from turmoil in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal and the battles over the budget deficit. At that first news conference, there were seven questions about relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Thursday night there was one. In January 1981 there was one question about relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Thursday night there were five. The news conference also showed there is one thing reporters have learned in eight years of trying to pin <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> down to specifics. Nearly every reporter Thursday night took advantage of the opportunity to ask a follow-up question. At the first conference in 1981, none of them did.

<TEXT>
 Two brothers led a gang that sold $ 100 million in cocaine a year and used violence to control the streets and drive off competing dealers, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Dread'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 32, a Jamaican-born alien, was among 23 people named in a 72-count federal indictment unsealed Thursday. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a $ 108 million fine. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has been in custody since August on charges that he killed one man and wounded another in a 1986 street shooting. His trial on those charges is set for January. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, his brother, <ORGANIZATION> Everton </ORGANIZATION>, 29, and other members of the gang routinely used violence to maintain control over those who sold the drugs, including crack, and to keep them from reporting their activities to police, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylson </PERSON>. The defendants, 16 of whom were in custody this morning, were charged with violating federal drug, racketeering and firearms laws. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office here, said the acts the defendants allegedly committed `` are tantamount to those of an urban terrorist group which has violently sought to satisfy its own greed by preying upon those addicted to illegal narcotics.'' `` They had little or no regard for anyone who stood in their way,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. `` They have oppressed children into doing their bidding and have threatened the fabric of life in this community.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s gang allegedly handled an annual average of 2,000 pounds of cocaine, plus an unknown quantity of marijuana, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Billbrough </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. A pound of cocaine sells for about $ 11,000 wholesale, and the retail price is roughly five times that, making the gross sales more than $ 100 million yearly, <PERSON> Billbrough </PERSON> said. All the defendants are charged with conspiracy to manufacture cocaine base, commonly called crack, and to distribute cocaine, crack and marijuana. The Smiths and two others also are charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of the federal `` drug kingpin'' law, which carries a maximum life sentence.

In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is collecting money to be used in aiding the quake victims, with Armenian church and ethnic groups in this country being particularly helpful, she said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are also collecting `` blood packs'' for shipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, she said. Blood packs are the materials used to collect blood from donors and separate it into various components, she explained.

 Relief planes from around the world rushed emergency supplies into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today to help victims of an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Zvarnots airport said planes arrived today from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and many more were expected. It was the first time disaster aid had reached the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on such a scale. Soviet officials released no death toll two days after Wednesday's quake, but the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON>, said today that about 80,000 people died in the southern republic. Speaking briefly in English to a delegation of Armenians at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, he said: `` Our estimate is, but it's not an exact figure, that we have about 80,000 people who lost life in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.'' He also said 2.5 million lost their homes, but that figure could not be verified and the republic only has a population of 3.3 million. A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency report said 400,000 people were homeless. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said `` the earthquake killed tens of thousands of people.'' Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said: `` It is believed that scores of thousands of people have died.'' Previous statements had put the death toll in the thousands, but sources have provided unofficial estimates of as many as 50,000 dead. A scientist predicted more tremors would occur. Workers scrambled to find survivors buried in the rubble. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> returned home to direct the growing relief efforts, which brought emergency food, medics, medical supplies and search equipment to the devastated region. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who cut short a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and canceled plans to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> before dawn, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. He was expected to travel to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but officials refused to exactly when. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> rescue team and 20 search dogs flew to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with eight tons of rescue supplies. Swedish officials announced $ 1 million in rescue assistance, and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> sent shipments of blood plasma. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered humanitarian aid, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> pledged to send construction workers, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also dispatched rescue teams. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Azruyan </PERSON>, an editor at the official Armenpress news agency in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, said he saw dozens of villages `` totally destroyed.'' In <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a city of 16,000 near <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, `` 99 percent of the population is gone,'' he said. `` Helpless sobbing people are climbing on the wreckage of an apartment house, from which can be heard heart-rending cries for help,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> wrote from <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a heavily battered city near the quake's epicenter. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists said the quake measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. `` We expect more tremors to take place soon in the area of the earthquake that shook the trans-Caucasian region on Dec. 7,'' said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shebalin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying the tremors `` should be less powerful'' than the quake, which also rocked portions of the republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Official Soviet media covered the disaster with unprecedented scope and speed. In an interview Thursday on Soviet television, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> appealed for aid to the area. He said rescue workers needed cranes and other heavy equipment to remove debris and look for survivors. TV reports said two-thirds of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a city of 290,000 on the Turkish border, were destroyed. <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> `` was practically erased from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' said one television correspondent. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said half the buildings in <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION>, a city of 150,000, had crumbled. It said the injured and those left homeless were being housed in tents, military barracks, officers' houses and clubs, garrisons and dining rooms. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartinsky </PERSON>, a senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' today that antibiotics, disposable syringes and blood supplies are needed. However, he said his organization has not issued an international appeal. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachatryan </PERSON>, a department head of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone that 4,700 injured people, including 800 children, were in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s hospitals. `` We have set up special surgical and trauma units in various hospitals and more than 300 specialists from other cities and other republics have arrived to help out,'' he said. Today and Saturday were declared days of mourning in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republics was called in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to discuss disaster relief.

 Solididarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today made his first foreign trip since <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s martial-law crackdown seven years ago and told reporters it was time to leave the Stalinist system behind. `` After seven years, here I am at the dawn of something new,'' said a smiling <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> after his arrival at Charles de Gaulle airport. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who was permitted to accept the invitation of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to join observances of the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said he was looking forward to meeting Soviet physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, another Nobel Peace Prize laureate invited by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to Saturday's ceremonies. `` We both still feel, he and I, the breath of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> at our backs,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, speaking Polish through an interpreter. `` The Stalin era is over.

But he said problems remained, such the government's monopoly on trade unions and its handling of social, political and economic problems. `` That is still the breath of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. It was not communism, it was him. And we have to end it ... by way of evolution and not revolution.'' `` I'd like to reach an agreement at last on pluralism and to finish the Stalinist system for good,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also was to confer with French trade unionists, the mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, leader of the French <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, before returning Monday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, bundled in a thick coat and sporting a front-billed fur cap, received cheers of `` Bravo Lech!'' when he arrived at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s central train station from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> earlier in the day Crowds also gathered around him and historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> at the airport, with parents holding up children for a better view. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a senior Solidarity adviser, was accompanying <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on the trip. In a departure from past practice, the state-controlled media treated <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as a public figure instead of as a private citizen. His departure for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was listed by the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency as one of its top stories of the day. It was the first time since the imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in December 1981 that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> received permission to travel abroad. The issuance of a passport to him Monday coincided with increasingly positive treatment of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in the official press since he appeared in a nationwide television debate Nov. 30. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was viewed by supporters as having handily won the debate with official unions' chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, and the non-confrontational tone of his remarks drew praise even from normally hostile government officials. The Solidarity leader last left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in October 1981, also to visit <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has led Solidarity since the inception of the first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc in August 1980. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had insisted <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a French medieval scholar who speaks French fluently, accompany him.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Groups Celebrate 150th Anniversary of Pioneer Trek</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 On horseback and ox-drawn wagons, Afrikaners paraded into the city Friday to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the white pioneers' trek into the country's heartland. The march, held seven days before the official anniversary, was organized by right-wing white groups. They object to the upcoming government-backed ceremony, which has been billed as open to all races. Nearly 1,000 whites, dressed in 19th century pioneer outfits, arrived in downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to mark the Great Trek, the 1838 journey by Afrikaners away from the British-ruled <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colony </LOCATION> into the country's uncharted interior. Altogether about 3,000 people attended the parade, with wagons arriving from several locations across the country. The Great Trek is the most momentous event in Afrikaner history. Stories about hardships on the journey and battles with African tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the Dutch-descended Afrikaners, who dominate the government. `` Today we remember how our ancestors built this country into a civilized area where it's safe for whites to live,'' said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> <PERSON> Combrink </PERSON>, 62. <PERSON> Combrink </PERSON>, wearing a leather vest and wide-brimmed hat, was accompanied by his wife in a period costume that included a bonnet and a full-length lavender and white dress with lace trim. `` This a day Afrikaners should be together,'' said <PERSON> Combrink </PERSON>. Organizers said blacks were not welcome at Friday's ceremony or at an evening gathering at the Voortrekker Monument, a huge granite structure on a hill overlooking the capital. `` The Great Trek marked the coming of our oppression, the stripping of our rights,'' said a 45-year-old black man who asked to be identified only as <PERSON> George </PERSON>. `` When I see this, I am very angry, very bitter.'' The 100th anniversary commemoration, held in 1938, is regarded as the catalyst that united the Afrikaners and gave impetus to their political organizations. Ten years later, the Afrikaner-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came to power and began codifying their apartheid policies of racial segregation. But the two separate trek celebrations illustrate the fracture between right-wing Afrikaners, who oppose all concessions to the country's black majority, and President's P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for gradual race reforms and limited power-sharing. Friday's ceremony was organized by the Afrikaner Peoples' Guard, a right-wing cultural group. The contingent that received the loudest applause was from the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, led by the charismatic <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>. Most members of <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>'s group opted not for the 19th century attire of their ancestors, but wore khaki outfits with swastika-like emblems on the shoulders. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> and his followers received sustained cheers as they rode around Church Square in the city center, in front of the courthouse where five black anti-apartheid leaders were sentenced to prison Thursday on treason and terrorism convictions following a controversial trial. The government-sponsored trek left <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Aug. 27 for the 870-mile trip to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Despite the government's announced intention of opening the celebrations to all races, few non-whites have participated. The government functions will dominate the next week leading up to the Day of the Vow, a national holiday, on Dec. 16. On that day in 1838, the Afrikaners vowed to make the date forever holy if they defeated a hostile Zulu tribe. They did so in the Battle of <LOCATION> Blood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and the day remains the most revered in Afrikaner history.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Friday he was stunned by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s decision this week to free a suspected Palestinian terrorist whose extradition was long sought by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` The release of this terrorist is shocking,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Zomar </PERSON>, who is wanted in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for involvement in a 1982 attack against a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> synagogue that killed a 2-year-old boy and injured 34 people. `` We can not mince words or in any way shirk the actions we have to take'' to combat international terrorism, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` This release is bad ... and I am shocked by it. When a known terrorist like this is released, it's shocking.'' He spoke after a two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers. <PERSON> Al-Zomar </PERSON>, 27, was arrested when he arrived in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1982 and served 20 months in a Greek jail for arms smuggling. His extradition was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 but never carried out. <PERSON> Al-Zomar </PERSON> was sentenced to another 20 months in 1987 for having a knife in his jail cell. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> put <PERSON> Al-Zomar </PERSON> on a plane to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Vassilis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> did not extradite him `` because <PERSON> Al-Zomar </PERSON> was acting in the struggle for the ... independence of his country,'' referring to the Palestinian fight for a homeland in Israeli-occupied territory.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its 15 Western allies decided Friday to seize on an `` unprecedented opportunity'' for change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by pursuing cooperative political solutions to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s problems. But Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> swan song after more than 30 meetings with the allies over 6 -LCB- years, cautioned against over-reaction to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` Being encouraged does n't mean that you just go bananas and forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the things that are constructive,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a final appeal for unity within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He stressed that even with the Soviet cutbacks, to be carried out over two years, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact still would retain an enormous advantage in battle tanks, artillery and other armaments. `` They will be significant and make a difference,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` But they leave a situation still very assymetrical. We should n't forget that. For instance, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, reading from data compiled by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on conventional forces, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s edge in divisions would be reduced to 2.91-1 from 2.99-1, in tanks to 2.18-1 from 2.76-1, and in artillery to 1.74-1 from 2.30 to 1. In a similar vein, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told reporters: `` We can not base our security on the good or bad intentions or the personality of the Soviet leaders.'' The former West German defense minister added: `` You know that we look upon Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with sympathy and encourage his reform efforts while they lead to more human rights and more responsible conduct in foreign affairs and a reduction in military capability.'' But, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must keep its defenses strong, and modernize weapons even while negotiating cutbacks with the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in talks expected to open next month in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. As a group, the foreign ministers pledged: `` We will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the search for political solutions to East-West differences.'' However, they also urged `` tangible and lasting changes'' from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help solve the problems dividing East and West. Soviet forces stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> estimated at 2.2 million, `` still exceed any reasonable defense need,'' and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its allies `` still have to meet fully their obligations on human rights.'' The ministers on Thursday announced the broad outline of the position <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will take in the Conventional Stability Talks with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact once a 35-nation human rights conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> is concluded. In a separate statement, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed that trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies should be based on `` commercially sound terms and mutual advantage.'' The statement rejected any notion of providing `` preferential treatment'' to the Soviets, who are eager for Western technology to help carry out <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika program of reconstructing the Soviet economy. The Western ministers said they wanted to avoid `` contributing further to Soviet military capabilities'' by extending concessions. In the arms area, <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> told reporters that after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` the climate for the conventional negotations has considerably improved. Much needs to happen but things are looking up.''

 A brush fire fanned by fierce <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds raced through a neighborhood of expensive homes early today, burning at least 20 homes and forcing evacuations of up to 5,000 people. It was the second day wind reached speeds above 60 mph. On Thursday, fires destroyed at least 22 homes and cut power to half a million people. Today's brush fire was in the <LOCATION> Porter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> district, 25 miles northwest of downtown, where many homes have flammable wooden shake shingle roofs, authorities said. Ten homes were destroyed and 10 were damaged as the fire spread through canyons in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Susana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and into foothill neighborhoods, said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Svider </PERSON>. No injuries were reported. `` One of the major problems up here is that we have a lot of wood shingle roofs and they go up like matchsticks,'' said Battalion Chief Dean <PERSON> Cathey </PERSON>. Cause of the blaze, which blackened at least 1,800 acres, was not immediately known. Wind gusted to 60 mph, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the relative humidity was 15 percent, compared to a normal 60 percent in the early morning. Police began evacuating a residential area of four to six square miles after the fire broke out about 5:45 a.m., said police Sgt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Boka </PERSON>. He said thousands of people would be forced from their homes near the northern foothills of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Porter Ranch residents were awakened by choking smoke and an orange glow in the sky. `` It was just like raining fire,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON>, 16, who helped his father wet down the family's home before they had to flee several blocks away. `` As I was spraying water the neighbors' houses started to burn; that's when I got scared.'' The Dinsmores' home survived the onslaught. `` Thousands of embers were coming down on us as we left,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Piorek </PERSON>, who fled the neighborhood with his family of four. At least three schools in the area were closed and some sections of boulevard and freeway access ramps were closed because of smoke. The hot, dry `` devil winds'' from the desert gusted to 69 mph Thursday, causing damage estimated at $ 10 million but no serious injuries, although some residents had to dash through flames to safety, officials said. `` We saw sparks, showers of sparks, like rain,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabadas </PERSON>, 18, recounting his family's flight from their <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> home on Thursday. Hardest hit were the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verne </LOCATION>, where fires blamed on wind-downed power lines destroyed at least 22 homes and damaged 12 others and five businesses. The winds toppled at least a dozen tractor-trailers and a motor home on freeways obscured by blowing dirt and sand. About 500,000 people were without power at various times. By nightfall Thursday, 30,800 remained in the dark in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> counties, utility officials said. Electricity was out in the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada-Flintridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, where schools were closed today. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds blow through the deserts on their way to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at this time of year, picking up both speed and warmth and increasing the fire danger in areas left dry by lack of rain. The forecast held little relief. The high-pressure system causing the turbulence, in combination with a low-pressure system off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, appeared to be stuck over southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I can see these winds continuing, although not as strong as today, into the early part of next week,'' weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> said Thursday. Fourteen homes were destroyed in <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> 20 miles northeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and five were damaged along with five commercial buildings when 75 mph gusts snapped power lines, igniting a fire at <ORGANIZATION> Allan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, fire officials said. Damage was estimated at $ 4.5 million. In La <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> and neighboring unincorporated parts of <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, eight homes were devastated and seven damaged in wind-driven fires. Damage was estimated at $ 5 million. `` We lost everything _ the house, the cars,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, 49, of <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>, who fled with his wife. `` We were lucky to get out. We had to drive through flames.'' An artificial Christmas tree wrapped in colored lights and tinsel lay on the driveway of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elinor </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>'s home, the only thing salvaged from the ruins. Awakened by a neighbor, the couple found a row of palm trees and a nearby home ablaze, and battled fires on their roof until they were overwhelmed. `` It was just like the air was full of these giant sparks,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, 56. In the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, six men were arrested for investigation of arson as firefighters doused a five-acre brushfire, a ridge into <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The powerful winds caused turbulence that jolted a <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet approaching <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, slightly injuring two flight attendants and four passengers. Damage was estimated at $ 40,000 to five floats being built for <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>'s Tournament of Roses Parade. The floats' chicken-wire skeletons were crushed when a giant tent housing them in <LOCATION> Azusa </LOCATION> collapsed. They were expected to be rebuilt by the Jan. 2 event. In <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION> to the south, a wind-fanned brush fire burned about 60 acres in a steep coastal canyon and threatened the Scripps Clinic hospital and other businesses before about 100 area firefighters contained it, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> fire spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> warned <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> motorists to exercise caution _ particularly those with campers, trailers and other high-profile vehicles vulnerable to wind.

 Suspected Sikh militants ambushed a car carrying one of the five high priests of their religion and shot him to death Friday in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, a news agency reported. <PERSON> Balbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was killed in the district of <LOCATION> Ropar </LOCATION>, north of the state capital, <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported.

The temple is the holiest Sikh shrine and the priests had said at the time that <PERSON> Barnala </PERSON> had commited sacrilege. Newspapers said <PERSON> Barnala </PERSON>'s re-entry into the community was opposed by Sikh militants. Sikh militants have been fighting for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. They have been blamed for at least 2,350 killings in the state this year. Many of the victims have been Sikh moderates opposed to the separatist campaign. The militants have labeled the moderates as traitors.

 As president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should declare children his top priority and commit the country to investing whatever it takes to ease problems ranging from poverty to abuse, a children's advocacy group said Friday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said his group is seeking a commitment similar to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s pledge to put a man on the moon. Money for the space program began flowing immediately, he said. `` We understand that there's a -LRB- budget -RRB- deficit,'' <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON> said, `` but in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, any important initiative that a president called for, we somehow found the money.'' The league, a network of more than 500 public and private social service agencies, is urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep campaign promises to expand Head Start; institute child care tax credits; expand medical coverage of the poor; and raise spending for homeless aid, school lunches, immunization programs and nutrition supplements for pregnant women and infants. <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON> said his group also is seeking enactment of at least some portions of last year's unsuccessful Act for Better Child Care in order to bolster the supply of day care. `` If you do n't have enough day care, a child care tax credit does n't work,'' he said. The league also is urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to support, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass, comprehensive programs for pregnant adolescents, children and youth with AIDS, families with no health insurance and unemployed youth, as well as a higher minimum wage, mandated family leave in the private sector and expanded supplies of affordable housing. <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON> said a good start toward the league's goals might involve $ 5 billion in new spending in 1989. `` We are totally realistic. We're saying let's start,'' he said. Asked where that money would come from, <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON> replied, `` The same place the money comes from for the stealth bomber, for the B-1 bomber, for the <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> ... the same place the money comes from to fund everything that we think is important.'' <PERSON> Liederman </PERSON> said the league has delivered to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a copy of its plan, called `` The First 100 Days: A Children's Initiative,'' and has requested a meeting with him. `` We like his promises,'' he said. `` We're optimistic. We're taking President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at his word.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Friday honored the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, although questions remain about this nation's commitment to such concepts. <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaotong </PERSON>, a well-known sociologist, was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> actively supports the development of human rights. <PERSON> Fei </PERSON>, speaking at a forum to commemorate the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> declaration, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s constitution guarantees individual rights, including freedom of religion and equality before the law. He noted, however, that the struggle for human rights should concentrate not on individual freedoms but on fighting colonialism, racism and foreign invasion. The report was the latest in a series of articles in the official press stressing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position that collective rights are more important than individual liberties. A <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report this week said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> believes that civil liberties, rights of minorities and women belong to the `` internal affairs'' of a country and advised other countries not to meddle in those questions. An article in the Nov. 28 issue of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review, an official weekly, soft-pedaled discussion of individual liberties. Human rights, it said, were a key part in the efforts of Third World countries to `` establish a new economic order.'' By pushing such a policy, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can justify both its criticism of apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and its rejection of accusations about its policies in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> or its one-party state. `` It is no good to force one country's standards on another,'' Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` Interference in a country's internal affairs on the pretext of human rights should be strictly forbidden.'' Western human rights groups have persisted in criticizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s record In February, the Washington-based group <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities tortured <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists seeking independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and performed forced abortions on members of minority groups. Pro-independence Tibetans have rioted twice in the past two years, leaving dozens dead in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the region's capital. The Asia Watch report quoted one Tibetan as saying, `` if one speaks forcefully, if one gives an account of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> as being independent, they apply cattle prods.'' Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its actions in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Plain English Campaign on Friday bestowed eight Golden Bull Awards for what it regarded as particularly undistinguished examples of doubletalk and obfuscation. `` This year has been a record year for gobbledygook. We could have given out hundreds of bulls without any problem,'' said <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, who helped start the campaign nine years ago. She cited the latest regulations for claiming state public assistance for housing, saying they `` lengthened many forms by over a half, yet the government minister who introduced them claimed they would simplify the system. The truth is that the forms are now so long they deter people from claiming.'' One of the 6-inch-high <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION> went to <ORGANIZATION> Sooner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snacks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for a letter to a customer who complained that her potato chips were purple. `` Potato varieties with pigmented skins owe their color to anthocyanins dissolved in the cell sap of the periderm and cells of the peripheral cortex,'' the letter said. When a chip is discolored, the letter added, `` It is difficult to say whether this is due to a process of active migration of the anthocyanin from the periderm and cortex or to primary protection within the flesh of the tuber.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> was cited for its response to a widow's inquiry about her pension. It explained that `` basic retirement pension based wholly or partially upon the contributions of her late husband can not be paid in full to a widow who is getting such a benefit. She can only be paid the balance of basic retirement pension and increase for putting off retirement which is left after taking off her war widow's pension or, the part of the basic retirement pension which is based purely on her own contributions, plus any increase for putting off her retirement, whichever is the more favorable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> won a Bull for a counter indemnity form which said: `` I-we jointly and severally undertake in the event of any claim being made upon you thereunder, or under any increase or decrease thereof or extension or renewal thereof -LRB- whether for the same or for a greater or less amount -RRB-, which you may hereafter make or agree to at my-our request, and in the event of the validity of such claim being disputed by me-us, from time to time ...'' and so on for more than 100 words before reaching the end of the sentence.

 Gas leaked past a caulked seal in the nozzle of a rocket booster used to launch space shuttle Discovery in September, but a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday that this was anticipated by the design and is `` a non-problem.'' <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, manager of the booster program at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that an examination of the disassembled Discovery solid-fuel rockets showed the engines worked `` as expected'' and that the gas leakage has been seen in testing and is considered a normal event. `` We're very happy with these motors,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said engineers examining the disassembled rocket parts found that gas seeped between panels of ablative material in the nozzle of one of the two boosters. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official said the nozzles of the solid rocket boosters are lined with panels of ablative material that is designed to burn away during the firing of the rocket. This action keeps extreme heat from penetrating the interior of the rocket nozzle. Between the panels of ablative material, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, engineers designed in a small gap to allow for thermal expansion. `` As just one more little protection, we inject an RTV -LRB- room temperature vulcanizing -RRB- silicone in there,'' he said. `` From time to time, we get some gas past this thermal filler.'' But he said the rocket booster nozzle is designed to accommodate this gas leakage and that the leak seen on the Discovery rocket engines was not unexpected or damaging. Two O-ring seals are the primary protection against leak of the gas and neither of these seals showed that they had been touched by superheated gas or flame. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that during full-scale tests of the rocket motor, an unfilled 10-inch gap was left between the ablative panels of the nozzle `` to demonstrate that we're tolerant'' to a leak through that gap. `` Not even the sheen was taken off the surface of the O rings,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said of the test. The accident that destroyed Challenger, which blew up 73 seconds after liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center in January 1986, was blamed on the leak of gas or flame from a field joint of a solid rocket booster. Since then, the rocket engines have been redesigned and tested with full-scale firings. The Discovery launch in September, the first shuttle mission since Challenger, used the new rocket design. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said engineers are only now beginning to examine the engines used last week for the launch of space shuttle Atlantis, but that no problem has been found with those rockets. `` This is a good motor,'' he said. `` We're ready to fly again.'' The next shuttle flight is scheduled for January.

<TEXT>
 An aging liberal bloc on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, anchored by ailing Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, is prompting renewed speculation on the impact President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have on the court's future. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, hospitalized Thursday with pneumonia, was reported Friday to be improving at the <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said he may miss little time on the bench since the high court begins a four-week recess Monday. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, 82, is the court's oldest justice and senior member in terms of service. He is two years older than the court's two other most consistent liberals, Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, both 80. Aside from <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s current bout with pneumonia, the three have appeared to be in good health and have given no signs they plan to step down anytime soon. Including Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 68, the average age of the court's liberal bloc is over 77. By contrast, the average age of the five more conservative members is slightly under 60. That group includes three appointees of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, 58, named in 1981 as the first woman on the high court; and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 52, both named during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. In addition, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> elevated <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, 64, to chief justice to succeed <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>. The ninth justice, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 71, an appointee of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, votes more often with the conservatives on key issues. While <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s illness lends new drama to conjecture about the high court's future, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have a more immediate impact on the lower federal courts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to search out conservatives to fill the existing 41 federal court vacancies _ 32 trial judgeships and nine appeals court posts. There could be many more for the president to fill over the next four years. Observers doubt that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be as devoted to conservative ideology as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who made 375 judicial appointments, filling more than half the total. Guessing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s likely <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appointees is a parlor game with conflicting clues. The president-elect has said he likes `` moderate people with conservative views.'' He also pledged during the campaign to pick judges `` who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate from the bench.'' `` I will appoint judges who do n't reserve all their sympathy for criminals, who understand that victims have rights, too,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. As further evidence of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s conservative leanings, he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unsuccessful attempt to place <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> on the high court. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, opposed for his conservative ideology, was defeated last year in a bruising political battle in the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Associates of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are quick to point out that the president-elect was a close friend of the late <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a moderate justice with much the same upper-class lineage. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was likely to pick someone closer to <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> than <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> if there is a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> vacancy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> declined to speculate. `` That's a pothole over which I will leap,'' she said. A Republican strategist who requested anonymity predicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will not choose anyone who is anathema to the movement conservatives'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> ideologues who rallied around <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. That strategy may rule out Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, the former governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> whose conservative credentials have been questioned. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> himself said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that `` judicial restraint'' is a qualification for the bench. He said he favors picking the best person available. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has said he will not impose a litmus test on judicial appointees. Anti-abortions would like assurances that the next justice, if given the chance, will vote to overturn the high court's landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision of 1973 that legalized abortion nationwide Legal experts offer a cross-section of names, including some moderates, when asked to speculate on likely <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> choices for the high court. The largest group consists of federal judges and includes the following <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees to the bench: _ <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgonbotham </PERSON>, 49, an appeals court judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> praised for his intelligence He could face conservative opposition because of a 1986 ruling that threw out anti-abortion laws. _ <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 52, an appeals court judge in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> _ J <PERSON> Harvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 44, an appeals court judge in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, 42, a judge on the prestigious and important federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and another in the prominent coterie of youthful conservatives picked by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rymer </PERSON>, 47, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> since 1983 Possibilities from outside the judiciary include: _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 58, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s close friend and choice to be secretary of state But <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> insiders doubt <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is interested in becoming a justice. _ Sen <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, 54, one of the nation's most conservative lawmakers who led the defense of <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> during the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation battle. _ <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, 54, named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, entered <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> today for physical exams and post-cancer-surgery tests to see if they have remained free of any malignancy. Both <PERSON> Reagans </PERSON> called out `` fine'' when reporters asked about their well-being as they entered <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, wearing bright blue running shoes, said he was `` going to be on a tread mill'' as part of his battery of exams and therefore had donned the footwear. Due to a light snowfall dusting the nation's capital, the president and his wife dropped plans to fly by helicopter and instead traveled by motorcade from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the hospital. The president was to undergo a range of tests, including his sixth colonoscopy, or examination of the intestine. The first lady was scheduled to have her second post-surgery breast X-ray. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not expect a report from the president's physicians until early in the evening. The Reagans were slated to leave the hosptal for Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, around 5 p.m. EST. Earlier in the day, the spokesman said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has gotten a positive report from his dermatologists, who examined him on Thursday and pronounced him free of any new skin cancers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had skin cancers removed from his face in August of 1985 and again in June of 1986. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said three physicians, including Capt. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlette </PERSON>, the chief of dermatology at the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, conducted a visual examination of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s skin on Thursday and they `` did not detect a change'' in his condition. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, the presidential physician, said in a statement released Thursday that neither the president nor the first lady has shown any `` clinical suggestion of recurrence'' of cancer. `` Both the president and the first lady have remained completely asymtomatic,'' <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who turns 78 in February, had a two-inch cancerous polyp removed from his colon in July 1985. The 67-year-old first lady had her left breast removed in October 1987 after a cancerous tumor was detected. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s statement also included a plug for the importance of such routine examinations. `` The first lady continues to emphasize the importance of mammography -LRB- breast X-ray -RRB- for early detection of cancer of the breast. The mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for early detection of a malignancy,'' he said. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s statement said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have a colonoscopy, a chest X-ray, a CAT scan, a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function evaluation. The first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing the surgery, an operation known as a modified radical mastectomy, in which the entire breast is removed, along with some lymph nodes. Physicians involved in the evaluation will include <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> and a colleague in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> medical unit, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>; Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a cardiologist; Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a specialist in pulmonary disease; Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, a radiologist; Dr. <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON>, a specialist in gastroenterology; and Dr. <PERSON> Elsworth </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherby </PERSON>, a specialist in nuclear medicine. All are on the naval hospital staff. Also participating will be Dr. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Beahrs </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> surgeon; his son, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Beahrs </PERSON>, who is a physician in private practice in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beart </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Utz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, the statement said. The elder Beahrs is an old friend and associate of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stepfather, the late Dr Loyal Davis of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In the president's initial cancer surgery, doctors removed the two-inch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon, as well as the surrounding tissue. Since the 1985 surgery, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has undergone five colonoscopies to check for any recurrence of cancer. In that procedure, a long, flexible instrument that uses fiber-optic technology is inserted in the large intestine to allow doctors to see inside the bowel. Each time, except for the last such test in anuary, doctors found small, fleshy growths known as polyps and removed them. In each procedure, the polyps were found to be noncancerous. The growths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left alone, can grow into cancerous lesions.

 Police officers posed as trash collectors and rode on santitation trucks to gain the confidence of drug dealers in a sting that resulted in 16 arrests. `` Once they saw the uniform and the truck, they trusted us,'' said one of the three undercover officers involved. `` They'd approach us and say, ` You guys want rocks You want a smoke?' We were approached by several ladies of the night who gave us lots of information on the crack houses in the neighborhood.'' The monthlong operation, which ended Thursday, was organized after city sanitation workers told police that they were offered drugs as they made their rounds. The officers said they gamely adjusted to the aroma their disguises required. `` It was just part of the job,'' said one.

 Students at a conservative Christian school were given <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> coloring books on gun safety Friday, and the superintendent dismissed any criticism as `` ridiculous and non-scholarly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> distributed the six-page books to students from kindergarten through fifth grade. `` They're constantly being exposed to guns on TV, at the movies, in the comics of every newspaper'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON>, superintendent of the 325-student school and its affiliates and home-schooling program, which involve a total of 25,000 pupils. `` If we get good feedback we'll order more'' books for other schools, he said. `` Children coming across an actual gun will be inquisitive. Nine chances out of 10 they'll pick it up and finger it. Chances are they will get hurt,'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said. `` We teach them to honor their father and mother and God by not playing with it.'' `` My Gun Safety Book'' features two children who find a handgun on a table. If children find a gun, the book stresses, they should leave it alone, leave the scene and tell their parents. Some educators and law enforcement officials believe such a book takes the wrong approach because it assumes guns will be available to children. Some critics say the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's strongest advocate of the rights of gun owners, should have no role in educating youngsters. But <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who heads the coloring book project for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization has promoted gun safety for 117 years and the book is `` just part of our continuing obligation.'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> also dismissed criticism of the effort. `` It's a knee-kerk reaction that is ridiculous and non-scholarly,'' he said. The conservative activist, who spent 10 days in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> jail after protesting at abortion clinics in August, said he's interested in the safety of children. `` I do n't have any great love for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, but if the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> comes out with a coloring book that says you should n't go with strangers who offer candy, I'll use that coloring book in the school,'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said. `` I'm an educator. I'm interested in the message,'' <PERSON> Lindstrom </PERSON> said. `` We use books from all kinds of publishers. They might have all kinds of political agendas.'' Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said said Friday from <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> got the books through <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zangrilli </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> board member in the west <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>School Halts Teaching Of Religious Carols After Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An elementary school music teacher has agreed to stop teaching religious Christmas carols because a Jewish parent complained it violated her child's constitutional rights, officials said. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> will not teach carols such as `` Silent Night'' or `` God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen'' for the rest of the holiday season, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 11 said Thursday. School district officials said they will try to determine whether carols are appropriate for district classrooms, spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We're asking our attorneys to research it legally, and we'll take a look at our curriculum adoption policy in the area of music and see if we are meeting the needs of all children,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and the parent who complained about the carols, <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Escovitz </PERSON>, declined to comment. The constitutionality of singing religious Christmas carols in school involves the same First Amendment concerns that have led the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to bar officially sanctioned school prayers, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a professor and specialist in constitutional law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. `` The question is, is this school's involvement in the Christmas season extensive enough to constitute religious observance?'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` It depends on the coerciveness of the school and the depth and seriousness of the observance.''

 A white beauty pageant winner renounced her title because of hostility from blacks, it was reported Friday. <PERSON> Lisiane </PERSON> <PERSON> Braile </PERSON>, 19, told reporters she was booed and physically threatened after being elected Carnival Princess in <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alegre </LOCATION>, a southern city of 1.1 million residents about 950 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. `` I renounced for my physical safety, because I was threatened in anonymous phone calls that I would suffer in the flesh for winning the title,'' she said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jornal </ORGANIZATION> do <LOCATION> Brasil </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Braile </PERSON> competed against 28 black and mixed-race women for the honorary title of <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princess </ORGANIZATION> in February's pre-Lenten festival. Blacks traditionally dominate the annual festivities. During the beauty competition, `` several black people asked, ` What's that white girl doing here?''' Miss <PERSON> Braile </PERSON> said. When she won, the largely black audience booed and insulted her, she said. A majority of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 144 million people are black or mixed-race, and racism is a crime under the Brazilian constitution. Although the government tries to promote an image of harmonious race relations, discrimination _ mostly against blacks _ is still widespread.

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> Mongolian </LOCATION> official on Friday welcomed Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pledge to reduce Soviet troop strength in this Central Asian country and said the process already has begun. First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Daramyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Endon </PERSON> said all the Soviet troops could be pulled out if relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continue to improve. `` We do n't think there is a need for foreign troops,'' <PERSON> Endon </PERSON> told a news conference. He said <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and its close ally, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, had decided to cut a large portion of the Soviet garrison in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> in order to strengthen mutual understanding and trust with other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, especially <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday he planned to reduce the Soviet army by nearly 10 percent and unilaterally reduce the Soviet troop presence in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Endon </PERSON> refused to say how many Soviet troops will be withdrawn or by when. He said military experts have yet to make those decisions. `` I can only say that a large part of the Soviet troops will be withdrawn,'' he said. `` The process has already begun and will continue until the end.'' The presence of about 1 million Soviet troops along <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s border, including those inside <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, has been one of the major obstacles to ending the nearly 30-year-old Chinese-Soviet rift Last year the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew one division containing about 12,000 troops from <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, leaving about 50,000 by Western estimates. They are believed to be confronted by an equal number of Chinese soldiers on the opposite side of the 2,900-mile-long Chinese-Mongolian border. <PERSON> Endon </PERSON> praised recent improvements in <LOCATION> Chinese-Mongolian </LOCATION> relations that have accompanied the warming trend between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He said there has been much progress toward normalization of government and party relations. The two countries signed trade and consular agreements in 1986. He said <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister will visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next year for the first time since the Chinese-Soviet split. <PERSON> Endon </PERSON> noted that during the 1950s, when <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were on good terms, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> did not station any troops along its border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> ideally would be able to cut its own military forces if relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continue to improve. `` Instead of sending our young men to the army we could use them in the building of socialism,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 La Coupole, the landmark <LOCATION> Left </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> restaurant where struggling young artists like <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> traded their paintings for hot meals, reopened Friday after eight months of renovations restoring its 1920s decor. `` La Coupole is more than a restaurant; it's an institution,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Coupole </PERSON>'s new owner. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flo </ORGANIZATION> chain of brasseries known for good food, fair prices and quick service, said the Coupole `` machine'' still had to be oiled and would get off to a slow start so as not to disappoint regular customers. The menu still features house specialities like lamb curry, steak tartar and baked <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and there are welcome additions from <PERSON> Flo </PERSON>'s nouvelle cuisine fare Prices have been held down, <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said, and the lamb curry, served with three tasty chutneys, can be had for $ 15. La Coupole has been a watering hole for artists and intellectuals, movie stars and politicians since it opened 61 years ago with <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocteau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Derain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON> on hand for the champagne. A decade later, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willian </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> nursed double scotches there while <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrell </PERSON> played chess long into the night. The post-World War II generation of existentialists made La Couple their haunt. Until his death in 1980, <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON> lunched there daily with <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>. The Coupole's main dining room is a classified historical monument and renovations of its vintage 1920s decor cost an estimated $ 5 million. On hand for the inaugural lunch of foie gras, scallops, chicken fricasee and an orange mousse cake washed down with vintage <LOCATION> Medoc </LOCATION> wines was <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafon </PERSON>, 91, the Coupole's original owner. `` Entering the restaurant I was very happy to find my Coupole,'' he said. The famed 32 pillars, wrapped with original, but mostly unsigned canvasses painted by artists from the School of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> _ turned out to be a Pandora's box. Under the cracking plaster, workmen found a type of emerald green stone that looked like marble. Though it was once the rage of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and still adorns the facade of some of the city's loveliest buildings, repairs were no easy matter: this man-made stone is no longer manufactured. The paintings themselves had been darkened beyond recognition by 60 years of smoke and cooking grime. They are now more resplendent than ever, thanks to four well-positioned spotlights on each post. `` We can really see the enormous variety of styles and colors adopted by painters of the School of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyse </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castelbajac </PERSON>, head of the restoration team, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. She said very few of the paintings are signed, and are thus a mystery that is unlikely ever to be solved. `` One painting has Picasso colors, but its forms are pure <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON>, so it's hard to say for sure whose it is,'' she said. `` I guess that will always be part of La Coupole's charm.''

<DATELINE>JABALIYA, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Refugees in this camp where the Palestinian uprising began a year ago were shut inside their shacks under military curfew Friday, but they said jailings and economic hardship would n't halt their rebellion. `` We are preparing for a long struggle. Palestinians have reached a point of no return,'' said a medical official in Jabaliya, the largest and most militant camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Jabaliya's narrow dirt alleys were deserted Friday except for a few goats picking through garbage piles. The occasional roar of an army jeep was the only sound breaking the silence. A few residents peered from the windows of their cement and corrugated tin huts. On Dec. 9, 1987, the camp was the site of the first demonstration in what came to be known as the `` intefadeh,'' or uprising. About 1,000 Palestinians shouting `` Death to the Israelis'' and chanting Islamic slogans hurled stones at soldiers. Troops opened fire, killing 17-year-old <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisi </PERSON>. Since then, more than a dozen residents have been killed in clashes and more than 1,000 treated for gunshot and beating injuries. The camp's 60,000 refugees have been confined to their homes for 116 days in the past year, and money is tight. Most young men are in jail. `` The next generation has taken their place,'' said the medical official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The stone-throwers are now 13 and 14 years old.'' Palestinians throughout the occupied territories seem to have settled in for a long confrontation with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while trying at the same time to maintain some normalcy. `` This has become our way of life,'' said a 24-year-old teacher for handicapped children who would only give his first name, <PERSON> Emad </PERSON>. Scores of members of his extended family were gathered in the lush backyard of his home in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s middle-class <LOCATION> Rimal </LOCATION> district. In the past year, it has become a clan custom to meet during strikes and curfews to help pass the time, <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> said. The uprising has touched even the youngest, <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> said. He pointed to his nephew, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a 2-year-old with curly blond hair who was hiding shyly behind one of the adults. `` The first word he learned was soldier, not mother or father,'' <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> said he had planned to get married on Saturday, but had to postpone the wedding because of Friday's indefinite curfew which confined the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s 650,000 residents to their homes. At <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, a five-minute drive away, doctors had settled into their `` strike day'' routine. During strikes called by the PLO-backed underground leadership, the casualty toll usually rises, in part due to increased army raids. `` In the beginning, we were completely overwhelmed by the number of casualties,'' said a senior surgeon who refused to be further identified. He said 4,200 patients had been admitted in the past year, most with injuries sustained during the uprising. Now, all doctors are on duty on strike days. Elective surgery is postponed and patients with light injuries are sent home to free beds. On Friday, only few clashes were reported in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and by midday doctors had only treated four beating victims. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION>, four Palestinians were wounded after Moslem noon prayers, Arab hospital officials said. The relative calm was, in part, the result of the curfews and heavy army presence. Dozens of jeeps patrolled <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s streets, and foot patrols combed Jabaliya and the nearby Shati camp. The low level of violence also indicated that Palestinians are shifting their emphasis from street confrontations to nation-building as the uprising enters its second year. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declared a Palestinian state during a Nov. 15 session in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. As part of the effort, local popular committees run by pro-PLO activists organize anti-crime patrols, provide first aid, visit families of those killed and settle disputes. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has outlawed the committees, but activists said the groups continue to function, taking the place of the old leadership of clan heads and and Israeli-appointed officials. `` We will have a state, but we do n't expect it quickly,'' said <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON>, 26, a top activist in the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Shabiba </ORGANIZATION> youth movement of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group. `` In the meantime, it's important to show we are a nation.

 The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> said today that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told him he intends to appoint a black to his Cabinet. Hooks, a Democrat, spent about 30 minutes with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, discussing a range of issues of concern to blacks, including judicial and Cabinet appointments. Hooks called the session `` very cordial.'' Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had pledged to name a black to a high-level job, <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said, `` I think I do remember him saying there would be a black in the Cabinet.'' Hooks then said it was his `` distinct recollection that he said he intends to do that.'' Hooks said he suggested to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the president-elect convene a White House conference on race and poverty after the inauguration next month. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with 60 black Republicans who had campaigned for his election. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a businessman from <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the group expressed concern that a black has yet to be tapped for the Cabinet, but said the meeting was friction-free. `` We have great hopes,'' he said. `` We have confidence he is going to follow through on his promise.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> businessman and official in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations, said, `` There is reason to believe there could be a black appointed to one'' of the domestic Cabinet jobs still unfilled. Vacancies remaining include those at the departments of Health and Human Services; Housing and Urban Development; Energy; <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>; Veterans Affairs, and the newly created drug czar. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, told the black supporters `` that we will over the term be pleased. He did not make any specific commitments as to numbers and individuals.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said one problem facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is that there are so few black Republicans qualified for administration jobs. `` They would have to look all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, who called the dearth of black Republicans `` a tragedy,'' and called for stepped-up <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> recruitment of blacks. The blacks said they were pleased with the energetic session they had with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, tapped to be the new <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman. Since the election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has appointed nine people to Cabinet-level posts and selected a handful of others for powerful jobs. Among those selected are one woman, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, named as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, and one Hispanic, holdover Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. While blacks have been mentioned for leading jobs, they have not been given any of them. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> this year, was thought to have a good chance of becoming <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador. The position was given instead to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, a career diplomat who has served as ambassador in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, is under consideration for secretary of health and human services. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he has told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition aides he was interested in the No. 1 job at that department but not in the second job. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON>, a black businessman from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, is in the running for secretary of housing and urban development.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will campaign to make the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> an observer-member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, putting the organization on a level with <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` We are now going to try and get a resolution that would make the Palestinian state an observer-member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the league's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative, said at a news conference. The session was called primarily to discuss next week's special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> at which <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will speak. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was denied a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa on grounds he has been involved in terrorism. The league, formed in 1945, comprises 21 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and `` Palestine,'' which it says is represented by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is currently one of two groups with permanent observer missions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the other being the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The current status recognizes their claim to represent peoples. The new designation would rank the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> among `` non-member states,'' elevating the status of the Palestinian people in Israeli-occupied territory. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said there would be no point in trying to make the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a full member, because it could not win approval by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. But, he added, `` Maybe this can be a transition to full membership at a later date.'' The non-member states are <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Discussing the Israeli raid Friday at <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, 50 miles inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> called it a `` pre-emptive strike against the peace option'' and timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the start of uprisings in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` This is a signal of further oppression yet to come,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said. `` This is unprovoked violence by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There has been no provocation. It is an attempt to destabilize <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to continue its illegal occupation of the south of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment at his news conference Thursday night that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement Wednesday saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and rejects terrorism `` in all its forms'' was ambiguous. `` We consider that Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements have been clear, unequivocal and categorical,'' he said. `` There is n't any ambiguity.'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said that `` to include the uprising within the context of terrorism, as the reaction of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seems to include, is mind-boggling and unacceptable.''

<TEXT>
 Officials and employees of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> are concerned about an unusually high number of miscarriages among women working in its newsroom. Some employees at the newspaper's suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters fear that a reported 14 miscarriages among 100 women employees over the past 15 months may be partially attributed to several months of construction work in the offices or to prolonged exposure to video terminals. Editor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON> said Friday that the company is giving `` close attention'' to the matter. Senior Editor <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, who confirmed only that there have been `` some miscarriages,'' said: `` Certainly the company is concerned about anything to do with employees. I'm concerned. I'm very concerned. But she also said: `` This is an internal matter and a very personal matter for the women involved. We're still looking into it and we do n't really have any more to say.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported that 14 miscarriages had occurred among USA Today employees since September 1987. Scientists say about one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage and that there have been studies of about a dozen cluster occurrences in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since 1980. A common thread in the incidences was the use of video terminals in the offices, although no direct link has been made between their use and pregnancy problems. A <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> reporter, who asked not to be identified, said the company brought in experts on video terminals to discuss any danger they might pose and has been taking an informal survey of employees to determine the extent of the problem. Management also has sent out a memo telling employees not to talk about the miscarriages, the employee said. `` The sheer magnitude of the construction work caused a lot of concern,'' the reporter said. `` Guys with jackhammers were breaking up walls right next to your head. You'd walk in to find your terminal covered with dust. And there were weird smells, very pungent odors. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, an epidemiologist who has studied miscarraiges for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no personal knowledge of the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today cases but they appear to be significant enough to merit study. He said, however, it was possible the occurrences were only coincidence and it is likely no cause will ever be proved. Extensive epidemiological studies would be required to determine whether there was any common cause, he said, since a number of factors could have contributed to each case. The Post did not say how many staff members had been pregnant, but one employee said there were no successful pregnancies among women working on the two floors that have been undergoing rennovation since April. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the internationally distributed newspaper, recently hired a consultant to test materials being installed during renovation, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported `` There's a lot of concern in the building about the construction, especially among women who have miscarried,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a general assignment reporter interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He said the company appeared to be `` genuinely concerned'' about the problem. `` Everyone is real frightened,'' a women who had a miscarriage and who asked not to be identified, was quoted by the Post as saying. `` You do n't know what's going on. It's really an ordeal.''

<HEAD>District Endorses Plan To Save Okeechobee, Delays Details</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A sweeping plan to stop the pollution of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> was endorsed by water directors Friday, but they delayed adopting details of the regulatory program until February, pending more hearings. The plan envisions strict limits on farm runoff into the lake, limits that some farmers say could drive them out of business. The nine board members of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> voted unamimously to approve a resolution supporting limits on the overall pollution content of the 700-square-mile lake, the nation's largest fresh-water lake outside of the Great Lakes system. The policy change comes in the wake of increasing phosphorus pollution over the last two decades that has spawned deadly algae blooms, wiping out fish and native plant species. One recent reading found phosphorus levels at a historic high in the nation's largest fresh-water lake outside of the Great Lakes system. Water from the lake flows into the <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, into Everglades National Park and to water-conservation areas that recharge the <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> aquifer, southeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s primary water supply <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, superintendent of <ORGANIZATION> Everglades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said that the plan could prevent the lake from becoming little more than a retaining pond for polluted water. `` But if it's finessed, delayed and circumvented, then it's going to be the year 2002, and the nutrient front -LRB- phosphorus -RRB- will still be a cancer moving south, and we will have lost more of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s resources,'' <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said One factor prompting the toughened standards was a federal suit filed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> accusing the district and the state of failing to protect water quality in the interconnected water system of the lake, <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> had said he might consider dropping the suit if the district adopted the new standards, but spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON> said Friday that the office would wait until it could examine the final plan. The biggest potential losers in the battle over phosphorus pollution, which comes principally from fertilizer and cow manure, are the sugar cane growers and dairy farmers who surround the lake. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said the new rules may drive cane growers in a few areas out of business, although most would be able to survive the runoff limits. He complained about the direction of policy, however, saying its aim seemed to be to force growers and dairy farmers to retain their runoff on their property. `` If you say that to the city of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the city of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> would n't exist. What are you going to do _ tear down the public library and build a retaining pond?'' <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. Environmentalists, who support the district plan, said the situation can not be compared with city sewage disposal. `` This is a scarce resource,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Podgor </PERSON> of Friends of The Everglades. `` You can not equate <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> to a trash dump.'' The district's pollution management plan would require all lakeside farms to decrease the phosphorus content of their runoff at least one-fifth by 1991, and they must meet interim goals before then. Some dairy farms would have to cut phosphorus levels by more than 80 percent. The district was required to submit a draft plan to the state by December under the state's Surface Water Improvement and Management Act.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge, ruling in the nation's first case challenging the constitutionality of the Emergency Housing Preservation Act, upheld the law in an opinion favoring low-income tenants in a gentrifying neighborhood. Although other courts do not have to follow its example, the ruling could influence other challenges to the 1987 act, which was designed to protect rent-controlled, federally subsidized private housing for low - and moderate-income families, an attorney for the plaintiffs said Friday Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> called Thursday's ruling a victory for rent rights of the poor, who are threatened by an increasing number of young professionals moving into renovated inner-city neighborhoods. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> issued his ruling in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 600 residents of a North Side building. The act prohibits private owners of federally subsidized housing from immediately charging higher, market prices for rent if the change would result in a reduction of available low - and moderate-income housing The case <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> ruled on involved owners of a 209-unit apartment building who sought to pay off a federally insured mortgage 20 years early. The partnership that owns the building, known as the 833 <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION>, gave the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> $ 1.8 million in January to pay off the mortgage and then sent eviction or rent-increase notices to the 600 residents, believing the paid-off mortgage had exempted them from the regulations. The owners maintained that the housing preservation law was unconstitutional and deprived them of their property without due process. And in any event, they said, they paid up before the president signed the bill on Feb. 5, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> noted that the law clearly had a retroactive effective date of Nov. 1, 1987, and said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had made `` a conscious choice to ignore a legislative demand'' in accepting the prepayment, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilen </PERSON>, another attorney for the plaintiffs. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>'s ruling means the building `` will remain under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulatory control. It means rent increase proposed in February were unlawful,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. The building's owners did not return phone messages Friday and their attorney, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, refused to discuss the case. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> called the ruling `` an influential decision in that it's the first decision of any court ... on the constitutionality of the act,'' he said `` Other courts are not bound by this judgment but we think ... it will affect their decisions'' on similar challenges to the law, he said. <PERSON> Wilen </PERSON> said one similar case is pending in federal court in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` What the law provides is that an owner who wishes to prepay -LRB- a federal mortgage -RRB- has two options. One is to prove to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> that the prepayment and resulting rent increases would not have a harmful effect for housing opportunities for low-income people and minorities,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. Under that option, owners `` would have to demonstrate that there's a ... surplus of low-income housing'' in their neighborhood, he said. `` If they ca n't establish that ... they can ask for additional financial incentives from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' such as an increase in subsidies, that would still keep them under federal jurisdiction, the attorney said. The owners of the <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> building did neither, he said.

<TEXT>
 Sunspot activity that peaks in about a year could be the second most intense since Galileo first saw the solar eruptions in 1610, and might knock satellites off course, cause scattered blackouts and disrupt phone calls and radio broadcasts, scientists say. Sunspots are relatively cool, dark, 1,200 - to 60,000-mile-diameter eruptions that appear where the solar magnetic field is most intense They emit solar flares, explosions that send protons, X-rays, electrons and other radiation streaming outward, sometimes causing magnetic storms on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by disrupting the Earth's magnetic field Most effects are subtle _ rare flickering of lights and poorer connections for satellite-relayed phone calls or television shows _ so `` the average guy on the street wo n't know if we're in the throes of a major magnetic storm,'' forecaster <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunches </PERSON> said Friday. `` They may notice the disturbance, but they wo n't know why,'' often wrongly blaming the phone company for noise on long-distance lines, he said by phone from the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, the government's forecasting agency for the storms. The average person also `` might not get his favorite radio station as well as he likes,'' or might notice the northern lights or aurora borealis farther south than usual, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> physicist <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON> said during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A so-far successful prediction that the current solar cycle would be exceptionally large was issued in early 1987 by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sabatino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Goddard Space Flight Center in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> news release said some scientists believe the `` solar maximum,'' or peak of the cycle, might be the biggest since 1610, when Italian astronomer-physicist <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galilei </ORGANIZATION> first observed sunspots. But <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> predicted this cycle wo n't be quite as large as the 1958-59 solar maximum, `` and we have no reason to change that,'' <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON> said the sunspot cycle lasts about 11 years, with the previous maximum in late 1979, the last minimum in September 1986 and the upcoming maximum expected as early as late 1989, much earlier than the 1991 date originally forecast. Magnetic storms are not dangerous to people on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But they pose a potentially lethal proton radiation hazard for spacewalking astronauts and spacecraft electronics, said <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwickl </PERSON>, head of research at the Boulder-based Space Environment Laboratory. Excess ultraviolet light from solar flares heats Earth's atmosphere, expanding it to produce drag that can make satellites in low orbits fall to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> prematurely, they said The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spacelab </ORGANIZATION> fell to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> after an intense solar flare in 1979. `` Some key missions may be affected,'' forcing <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to plan spacecraft launch dates and adjust orbits to minimize the problem, <PERSON> Zwickl </PERSON> said. `` If there had been a man on the moon in August 1972 -LRB- during a flare of protons -RRB-, he would have absorbed a lethal dose of radiation,'' <PERSON> Zwickl </PERSON> said, adding that proton emissions in the cycle should peak between 1991 and 1993. Sometimes magnetic storms cause major blackouts, as was the case in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> about a decade ago, <PERSON> Zwickl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kunches </PERSON> said X-rays from flares disrupt military and other communications that cross polar areas or bounce signals off the layer of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere called the ionosphere. <PERSON> Zwickl </PERSON> said no one knows why solar maximums vary in intensity.

 A 9-year-old boy who was struck by a car and killed while riding his bicycle carrying two vials of cocaine lived a tumultuous life that included a brush with death at age 4 and a drug entanglement two months ago. `` He was a nice boy, full of humor. He was really active, busy, but he really did n't do anything bad,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, an instructor at <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ministries, a church center in <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s neighborhood. The last time Ms. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> was Nov. 29, the day he was struck by a car while pedaling his bicycle on a busy, four-lane road in suburban <LOCATION> Ross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. He died of head injuries Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> was only 4 when his mother, <PERSON> Larita </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, then 25, dropped him to safety from the second story of a burning tenement housing drug addicts and alcoholics in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Hurshel </PERSON> <PERSON> Langham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who caught <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> that day in January 1983, remembered <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> as friendly and intelligent. `` The thing that amazed me was how he was able to survive in there with all of the drunks and junkies. I was totally impressed that he could live in that environment and be so well contented,'' said <PERSON> Langham </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was convicted of arson for allegedly setting the fire, which killed four people. She was sentenced to life in prison, and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> was sent to live with his grandparents in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Two months ago, police searched the home <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> lived in with his grandparents and an aunt and uncle after family members told police Sept. 2 that the aunt, 20-year-old <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, was acting as a drug courier and planned to get drugs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to records in <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> would not let officers search her bedroom. After police left, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> went to his aunt's bedroom, but his uncle and grandparents stopped him as he tried to leave and found 40 bags of heroin and cocaine in his clothes. The aunt, who was charged with multiple drug offenses and corrupting a minor, is free on bond awaiting trial. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Ross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zotter </PERSON> said investigators are looking for links between the vials <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> was carrying when he was struck and drug residue found in containers taken from the aunt's bedroom.

Family attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the boy was asthmatic and had been taking cough syrup that contains alcohol. The boy had been seen riding his bike erratically on the same highway in the days before he was struck, and police were responding to a similar report when the fatal accident occurred, <PERSON> Zotter </PERSON> said. The teen-age driver was charged with leaving the scene of an accident. The bike seemed to be one of the few constants in Francisco's life `` On a nice day he'd bring his bike down and park it and play out back,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a worker at <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ministries. `` He loved his bike.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should be cautious about Soviet proposals for deep reductions in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> troop levels because <LOCATION> Krelim </LOCATION> leaders believe they still could win a war with fewer soldiers than they have now, a congressional study said Friday. The report by a trio of congressional agencies was completed before the announcement of troop reductions made Wednesday by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speech, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would reduce its military forces 10 percent worldwide. That would include the withdrawal of some Soviet troops and tanks from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Friday's report was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It was done in response to last year's <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill, which ordered a wide-ranging study of the military balance between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. The study sounded four major warnings about the onging U.S.-Soviet efforts to negotiate lower levels of troops and military power in the European theater. The cautionary notes were based on the possibility of a Soviet attack on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The study said: _ `` First, because the Soviets do not believe that they must have superiority across the theater in order to achieve victory, caution must be exhibited in any agreement for force reductions.'' It noted the Soviets now enjoy at least a 2-to-1 advantage in many major measures of military might. But it noted that `` Soviet writings suggest that the Soviets could have a force advantage across the theater of as little as 1.25 to 1 _ or even parity _ and still achieve victory.'' _ `` Any overall symmetrical reduction in forces would not be to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s advantage, given that lowering the density of forces, by Soviet calculations, would aid the attacker and make rapid advance and maneuvers easier.'' _ `` Unless all equipment is disabled or destroyed, the Soviets could agree to force reductions, knowing that a dramatically reduced division would be capable of regneration in a few weeks.'' _ `` Finally, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should not expect any significant unilateral reductions on the part of the Soviets _ either to promote good will or to pressure <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> into an equivalent response _ that would not also be in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s own military and political interests.'' The report studied Soviet military attitudes toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and concluded that `` Soviet planners believe that they have a marginal advantage in the conventional balance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today, although they are far less optimistic about the future.'' The Soviets do n't believe they need a numerical advantage to win a military attack, the study said. `` Instead, the ability to mass at decisive places and times with sufficient forces to achieve their objectives is the key.'' While the Soviets have roughly a 2-to-1 manpower advantage now, the Soviets apparently have concluded that a 1.5-to-1 force advantage _ or even parity _ across the entire theater may be sufficient to enable their forces to achieve a 3 - or 4-to-1 force advantage on a few breakthrough sectors and 4 - to 8-to-1 advantage at the tactical point of penetration, the study The study was prepared by a variety of experts, including Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>; former arms negotiator <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>; Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seapower subcommittee; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of defense; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolsey </PERSON>, former undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> The report offered no clear answer to the question of who is ahead _ <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> or the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. It noted that `` neither side has such an overwhelming advantage that its victory would be assured.'' But it added that `` most scenarios favor the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact as the victor rather than <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has a chance of success, but it needs to address its many shortcomings to enhance that chance.'' The study said `` despite problems in measuring the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact force balance, the experts agreed that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s peacetime deterrent position is good and that its conventional capabilities have improved over the last decade, but they should be better.'' If the Soviets struck quickly, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> likely could do a good job of defending the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the study said. But in a long fight, the balance might swing toward the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact because of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> shortcomings in logistics and stockpiles of weapons and ammunition.

 Key lawmakers warned on Friday that the drawn-out selection process is politically weakening <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expected choice for defense secretary. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incoming chief of staff said such delays are unavoidable <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> refused to discuss what's behind the delay. However, Tower's supporters and a transition source who declined to be named said it was primarily an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check believed to be delving into the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's personal life and allegations made by his ex-wife. `` If being thorough in the system creates a problem, then you have to accept that,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I ca n't imagine anybody who is criticizing us who would suggest to us that we find a shortcut through a system that ought to be allowed to cover all the details as efficiently and as effectively as you can. Tower, who was an arms negotiator for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after retiring from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, has long been considered the top candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post. `` You always wish things could go faster,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` And yet, in today's world, the worst thing you could do is to do things quickly rather than thoroughly and that applies to all appointments, not just the Tower one.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., a backer of Tower and adviser to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on defense, said, `` They -LRB- FBI -RRB- are checking allegations and rumors _ womanizing, drinking involvement in defense contracts `` They seem to be surfacing all the time,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said in an interview. `` All allegations have to be put to rest so there is no embarrassment at a later date. From their viewpoint I would n't do anything different. It's just sad that it's harming <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to some degree.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said Tower's former wife `` obviously has been feeding'' the rumors and `` provding grist for the mill.'' A source close to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, commenting only on condition he not be named, said, `` I think just that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> checks are taking a long time. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> had a messy divorce. And his wife has suggested 17,000 different problems. ... And every single one of those has to be checked out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said this week he was `` disinclined to believe'' allegations about Tower. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who will step down soon as governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, said on other subjects in the interview: _ He will not return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in two years to run for office `` I want to be chief of staff for eight years with this president; I want to give him the best eight years a president has ever had,'' he said. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> still has money left over from his gubernatorial campaign, and said, `` Some day I might come back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and run for office, governor or senator or whatever.'' _ Direct access to the Oval Office will be guaranteed to the chief of staff, deputy chief of staff and the national security adviser As for Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said, `` They -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- are going to work out their arrangement, and obviously whatever the vice president -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- decides is the way to work will be the way we work.'' On Tower, Sen. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> expressed concern about the delay, saying, `` The longer it takes, there's bound to be an impact on his stature. I do n't think it's significant now but it could be if it drags on much longer _ more than a week or two. Then I think it starts becoming serious.'' Similarly, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said, `` I think anyone who is allowed to hang out as the designated nominee without any confirmation from the president-elect is bound to suffer a thousand wounds. `` I think they should move quickly to resolve the position, and if it's going to be Tower it should be in the very near future, and if it's not going to be Tower they should say so.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he, too, understood the nomination was being delayed by background checks. Moreover, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s team has been debating whether the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chief should be a managerial type or a policy maker. `` I think they have come to the conclusion the secretary should be the policy maker and that the deputy should be the manager,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` I have talked to Tower and I think he would like to have a strong manager as a deputy,'' the senator added. `` He -LRB- Tower -RRB- is not going to be dealing with the minutiae of procurement reforms.'' As for Tower's personal life, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he has known Tower since 1978. `` I do n't think <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> professed to be a saint to anyone but I do n't think that's what we're looking for.'' He said he had never `` witnessed any excess in drinking or anything else'' by Tower. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a speech, `` If Tower is named defense secretary, he will come into office in a weakened position ... For one thing, with all that twisting in the wind, questions will be raised about how much confidence the president has in him.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said he still expected Tower to get the job. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, `` Barring any unforeseen disclosures in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation that we have not already heard about, I would expect him to be the nominee.'' A top aide to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking privately, said, `` I still think it's a 75 percent bet.''

 A conservation group Friday unveiled an attempt to wrap the message of tropical forest conservation in a rap music videotape. The six-minute videotape made by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund should be seen by `` 5 million to 7 million kids'' next year in 50,000 schools, said <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, member of the fund staff and co-author of the teacher's manual that accompanies the tape and other materials. Interspersed with shots of exotic animals, birds, plants and reptiles in the jungles of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a group of youngsters about 10 years old dances through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> streets and the <LOCATION> Botanic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> on the Mall in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The lyrics reveal the rocky metrics, pulsing beat and sustained rhyme of typical rap numbers: `` The red-eyed frog has suction pads to cling _ `` They climb vertically, I guess that's their thing. `` Howler monkeys, now they got the style, `` Their howls can be heard over half a mile `` And that's a caiman, waiting a while `` For its prey to come, it's related to the crocodile.'' The teachers' kit was made in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Traveling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is sending a tropical forest exhibit to 14 cities. The fund will give 1,000 copies of the tape and teaching materials to host institutions in those cities. Others will be asked to pay $ 20 per kit or $ 5 for the tape alone. Conservationists say 27 million acres of forest, an area bigger than <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, are lost around the world each year through logging and conversion to farmland, threatening the existence of thousands of exotic species not even studied yet by scientists, local environmental damage and exacerbation of the greenhouse effect warming of the earth. `` We surveyed teachers across the country and they told us in a world of <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> we could n't use film strips and slide shows'' and hold students attention, said Ms. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>. The idea for the tape came from the rap video idea advanced by staffer <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who produced the tape. A grant of $ 75,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> supported the project.

 The former captain of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship whose alleged failure to help a boatload of starving Vietnamese refugees apparently forced them to resort to cannibalism will be court-martialed, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was relieved of his duties in August after Vietnamese refugees claimed the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dubuque </ORGANIZATION> did not assist them when it met up with their boat in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 9. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials said 52 of the refugees later reached the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but 58 died during the 37-day voyage. Survivors said two Vietnamese died of starvation but three others were slain and eaten by fellow passengers. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said Friday that the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, ordered the court-martial after reviewing findings of an investigation conducted at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base and in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>'s destination when it spotted the Vietnamese boat. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said no date had been set for the court-martial, but it probably would be held at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The investigation, which corresponds to a civilian grand jury probe, was completed Oct. 28 and forwarded to <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> on Nov. 7, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said. It found that the Vietnamese vessel was out of food and water and with an inoperative engine and sails when it encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> claimed the boat was seaworthy and that the crew provided food, water and navigational directions. <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said the investigation determined that the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> failed to provide food, water and clothing, even though some of the refugees were naked, dehydrated, and weakened from their ordeal at sea. He said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> faced seven charges, including failure to render assistance to a vessel in distress and failing to determine the condition of the vessel. He said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, who is now in <LOCATION> Sasabo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, could be dismissed from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and imprisoned for two years on each charge if convicted. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> also was charged with failing to rescue a Vietnamese refugee who jumped into the water and tried to swim to the port side of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said. He said another Vietnamese tried to climb a rope ladder on the side of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, but the crew shook it and he fell back into the sea. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> also did not report the location of the Vietnamese vessel by radio so that other ships in the area could render assistance, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said. Quoting the report, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said the Vietnamese vessel left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on May 22. By the time it encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> on June 9, there were 83 men, women and children, including one infant, still alive, the report said. Filipino fishermen later rescued the refugees. They were taken to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>, where they were cared for by Filipino and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> authorities. One of the refugees, 10-year-old Hung <PERSON> Quoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Tran </PERSON>, was reunited late last month with an aunt and grandmother in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> did himself a big favor 30 years ago when he helped develop the first heart pacemaker. Now he has one for himself, after emergency surgery. `` It was just the sort of thing that all the work we did a good number of years ago was all about,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 57, said Thursday in his room at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` All of a sudden, you're on the other side of the fence.'' An ambulance picked up the <LOCATION> Shoreview </LOCATION> resident Wednesday and rushed him to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s, his heart erratically thumping 10 and 20 beats a minute. For 20 to 30 seconds, he said, it would n't beat at all. He was suffering from second-degree heart block, a potentially fatal disruption of the heart's electrical system. Cardiologists implanted into <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s upper chest one of <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION>'s latest pacemakers, a double-lead model that stimulates both of the heart's pumping chambers. `` I feel fine,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Things are coming along nicely. Once you get the unit in there it stabilizes quickly. All of a sudden my hands and feet are warm again.'' In the late 1950s, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, then a biomedical engineer, worked with <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> surgeon, to develop what was called the Hunter-Roth bipolar electrode. They worked with animals in a laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>'s and in a north <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> garage that was the center of <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> operations in those days. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said he has been out of the engineering business for many years and now works as a financial consultant. He said his heart block condition was first diagnosed 15 years ago, but did n't progress until about a year ago. He was planning to arrange an appointment to get a pacemaker implanted when his heart began to sputter Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and Polish Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, each making his first visit abroad since winning the Nobel Peace Prize, arrived Friday to join a human rights celebration. The two men, who were planning to meet for the first time during the weekend, were invited by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> for ceremonies marking Saturday's 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> Director General <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> were scheduled to speak Saturday at the <LOCATION> Palais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chaillot </LOCATION> overlooking the Seine that will be attended by hundreds of dignitaries, human rights activists and politicians. In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Friday accepted the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize check on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, on his way back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> following a four-week visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, arrived Friday morning at <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gaulle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and was to be joined by his wife <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> on Friday night for the couple's first trip together outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, allowed to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the first time since martial law was declared in 1981, arrived Friday night at the same airport and told reporters he was looking forward to meeting <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. `` We both still feel, he and I, the breath of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> at our backs,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, speaking Polish through an interpreter. `` After seven years, here I am at the dawn of something new,'' he said. `` The Stalin era is over. Now I am waiting for the return to pluralism and the restoration of rights.'' At a 90-minute-long news conference at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called for more steps to reduce the size of the Soviet military. The 67-year-old physicist said one way to do this would be to limit the length of service for Soviet draftees. Commenting on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by 500,000 and withdraw thousands of tanks and troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said it was a major decision but only a beginning. He said reductions in manpower and weapons `` can be done and will change in a major way the international situation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is going in this direction and this is very important. I would have liked to see bigger cuts but what was done is important.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, previously was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific work. He was also restricted to the industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> for seven years because of his outspoken opposition to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In 1986, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> personally called him back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Since then, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has generally supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or political and economic restructuring, while speaking out against some trends, including the growing concentration of power in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hands. He twice sidestepped questions about the political implications of the meeting he is expected to have with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who is being allowed by Polish authorities to make his first trip abroad since the military crackdown on the independent union seven years ago. In an interview published Thursday in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he believed authorities granted him the visa because <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> seeks better relations with the West `` and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> can facilitate this.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Prize in 1983, on Thursday told the French daily Liberation that he was looking forward to meeting <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the 1975 prize winner. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will confer with French trade unionists, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Montand </PERSON>, Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> and Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, leader of the French <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> will meet <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> on Saturday. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted without dissent by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic document under which member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolish torture and slavery. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> commemorated the annniversary Thursday by honoring anti-apartheid activists <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and four other rights advocates.

 From Communist Party headquarters to street cafes, East Europeans are giving an enthusiastic response to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pledge to withdraw some Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It's great, for us it's a real sign of hope for peace,'' said one <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> teacher as she sat with a group of people around a table in <LOCATION> Egon-Erwin-Kisch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Unter den <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> boulevard. `` The political significance of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s words really can not be praised enough,'' said a student. Both asked that their names not be used. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced a unilateral reduction of 500,000 soldiers _ 50,000 of them in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ including the withdrawal and disbanding of six tank divisions from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by 1991. Soviet allies quickly hailed the speech and said the moves were discussed with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in advance. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who has refused to follow <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and political reforms in his own country, praised the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's pledge. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` welcomes and fully and completely supports the far-reaching new initiatives and suggestions,'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said at a state reception for <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Raif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> Wednesday. Western analysts say the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has about 380,000 troops in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the largest force in one of its allied countries. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run television broadcast <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech live and official newspapers carried the full address under banner headlines. Hungarian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON>, who is visiting <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, was quoted by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> as telling a news conference there: `` I can say that together with our Chinese partners we welcomed this initiative of great significance in the greatest accord.'' Hungarian Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> was quoted as saying the Soviet withdrawal would affect about one-fourth of the Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, indicating about 12,000 Soviet troops would leave. The official Czechoslovak news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> on Friday welcomed the Soviet initiative `` with high appreciation and full support.'' An estimated 80,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> came to the country during the 1968 Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion that crushed the short-lived `` Prague Spring'' of liberal reforms. Gen. <PERSON> Kamen </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>, a member of the Bulgarian army general staff, described <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announced steps as a `` program of the 21st century.'' Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>, in a statement issued by the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said: `` The announced pullbacks will contribute essentially to easing the threat of military confrontation on our continent, especially central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Czaputowicz </PERSON>, co-founder of the unofficial group Freedom and Peace, said he hoped the move would lead to removal of all Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Szymanderski </PERSON>, another co-founder of Freedom and Peace, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> army is `` the most important Stalinist institution in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s action was `` very important, one of the most important steps in the de-Stalinization of Soviet policy,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview.

 <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s new city council will stop evicting residents of the black township who have taken part in a 3-year-old rent boycott and will not force them to pay back rent, anti-apartheid activists said Friday. The delegation of activists made the announcement after meeting with the black council for several hours. The delegation included Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, miners union leader <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON> and others who in the past have refused to negotiate with the council. The rent boycott is one of the most effective forms of protest still available to blacks under the 30-month-old state of emergency. The boycott was launched in 1985 to press a broad range of grievances against the government. Overdue rent in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> alone is believed to exceed $ 100 million. Authorities have used numerous tactics to try to break the boycott, including late-night eviction raids such as one in August 1986, which led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a confrontation with police. Friday's meeting came two days after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s highest court, the Appeal Court in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, ruled that previous councils of the township had no legal authority to collect rent from occupants of the thousands of homes built in the 1940s and 1950s by the city council of neighboring <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. At the time there was no separate black administration in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches and leader of the activists' delegation, said the councilors agreed that, because of the court ruling, no Sowetan was required to pay any of millions of dollars of rent withheld during the boycott. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said further negotiations would take place to determine whether some residents should now be awarded ownership of their houses and what type of rent or service charges should be paid in the future. He and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> indicated activists viewed the new council more positively than its predecessors. `` They are people who want to do good, people who honestly believe they can change the system,'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said. `` Whether they can it, subject to an apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, remains to be seen.'' `` They told us our grievances were their grievances,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid, the nation's 26-million black majority has no say in national affairs. Black local councils have been denounced by activists as subordinate extensions of the white-dominated political system. Soweto's new council took office following nationwide municipal elections Oct. 26 which were the target of an illegal but successful boycott by blacks. About 11.5 percent of the eligible voters in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> cast ballots. The new council, seeking to distance itself from the old ones, proceeded to rehire municipal workers fired during a strike and said it wanted to consult with community leaders to solve problems facing its 2.5 million residents. One of the consequences of the five-month municipal workers' strike was an accumulation of trash on roadsides throughout <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> The council is launching a clean-up campaign Saturday, and drew praise from the normally critical local newspaper, The Sowetan, for a proposal to pay children to join the clean-up. The activists said in a statement Friday that negotiations with the council would continue only if it were able to guarantee that community leaders were not harassed or detained as they consulted with residents.

 The solar panels on the secret spy satellite launched by the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> failed to swing open the first time ground controllers commanded them to, and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials briefly feared the mission might fail, an industry magazine reports. But, with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk if necessary, a second set of radio commands freed the panels, and the satellite was successfully deployed high over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Dec. 12 issue. The panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers the satellite's batteries. The magazine, citing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, said deployment of the $ 500 million <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> radar satellite took place on the shuttle's fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was launched at 9:30 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 2. After the astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm to release the satellite, they kept their spaceship close enough to watch the deployment, and were able to visually confirm when it was fully open to its 150-foot span. Had it not, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> were prepared to take a spacewalk to repair or retrieve the satellite. The magazine said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> first maneuvered the shuttle to a point about 3 miles from the Lacrosse, then to about 5 miles away, then further at 5-mile increments. These maneuvers were witnessed by a network of amateur astronomers linked by computers around the world and headed by <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Molczan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, according to the magazine. It said the astronomers observed close-formation flight between the Atlantis and the Lacrosse on their sixth and seventh orbits. By Dec. 6, just before the shuttle returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, members of the group in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> observed the Lacrosse about 180 miles from <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>, the magazine said. The mission was the third entirely classified shuttle flight, and neither <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> released any information about its purpose. However it was widely reported _ even by the official <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> _ that the Lacrosse was being deployed to observe Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European military operations through darkness or cloud cover. Such information would be valuable for verifying Soviet arms compliance. The satellite would also serve as a `` radar eye'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber.

The contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will be worth about $ 10 billion over five years, the Oak Ridge office said. The two contracts cover the gaseous diffision plants at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>; and the Oak Ridge Y-12 weapons component plant. The Oak Ridge gaseous diffusion plant has been shut down, but employees there support the other plants. The <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> plant has been in a separate contract and the other four units have been lumped together, but the department said it was now putting the Oak Ridge installations in one contract and the <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> plants in another. This will `` focus management attention on the uranium enrichment enterprise,'' the department said. The current contracts expire next Sept. 30.

 Frightened eastern <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents stayed inside behind drawn curtains after four men were shot on four successive nights, including three injured by shots fired through their windows, police said Friday. One person was killed. The shootings in two <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> communities have enough in common to point to one gunman, police say, but they have not figured out a motive. The victims apparently do not know one another, police said, but they believe the four were not shot at random. Residents have begun shutting themselves in after dark, drawing their curtains and responding to callers with extreme caution, police said. Officials refused to predict that the sniper would strike again Friday night, but extra patrols were deployed and state, county and local police held a meeting to coordinate their investigation. All the shootings have occurred after dark, most around dinnertime, within a two-mile radius in <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverhead </LOCATION>. The victims, all men in their 30s, were shot with either a small-caliber rifle or a lightweight shotgun. `` I do n't at this point think we have a random sniper loose in the streets who is just shooting away at anyone he sees,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Riverhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Grattan </PERSON>. The two villages are about 75 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, not far from the exclusive beach communities called the Hamptons, frequented in summer by the city's wealthy. `` You do n't know where he's going to go next,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Riverhead </LOCATION>, a neighbor of one of the victims. An anonymous caller believed to have been the gunman contacted <LOCATION> Riverhead </LOCATION> police after the first shooting Monday and said, `` death to drug dealers and crooked cops,'' according to a source involved in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity. A similar call came after the second shooting on Tuesday, he said. But police said none of the victims was known to have dealt drugs. `` We think there is a reason for these shootings, a perverted type of thing,'' the source said. The gunman seems to know the area well enough to be a local resident. Police theorized that he left a car at a distance from the scene and approached his targets on foot. The shootings occurred this way, according to police accounts: _ About 6:40 p.m. Monday, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamesport </LOCATION> stepped outside his auto-customizing shop in <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION> to see why his dog was yelping. The dog had been shot. Other shots rang out and <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> fell fatally wounded by a .22 - caliber _ On Tuesday at 6:05 p.m., <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, 34, a carpenter, was watching television with his wife and three children at his home in <LOCATION> Riverhead </LOCATION> when a shotgun blast came through the window. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> had his hands clasped at the back of his head and the birdshot blew off the middle finger of each hand. He also suffered scalp wounds. He was listed in satisfactory condition Friday. _ <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Squires </PERSON>, 39, a sign painter, was wounded in the shoulder by a shotgun at his home in <LOCATION> Riverhead </LOCATION> about 10:50 p.m. Wednesday. <PERSON> Squires </PERSON> had answered a knock at the door but saw no one. He closed the door and started to draw the kitchen curtains when a shotgun blast through a window in the door hit him in the shoulder. He was hospitalized in serious condition. _ About 6:15 p.m. Thursday, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Crump </PERSON>, 31, was shot in the jaw with a light-caliber rifle bullet by someone firing through a window as he ate his dinner with his mother and nephew in the living room of his home in <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION>. The slug came out his neck and lodged in a wall. He was treated for his wound and released.

<HEAD>Walsh: North Diverted Money to Contras Earlier Than He's Admitted</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with new filing on when North began
diverting money</NOTE>

 Former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> began using Iranian arms-sale proceeds to arm Nicaraguan rebels two months before he told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the diversion had started, Iran-Contra prosecutors said Friday. `` A substantial quantity of weapons'' were bought for the Contras in December 1985 from money left over from the aborted sale by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985, Iran-Contra prosececutors said in filing in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s case. The prosecution evidence contradicts <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony last year that the idea of diverting arms-sale profits to the Contras was first suggested to him in January 1986 by Iranian arms dealer <PERSON> Manuchar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON>. The weapons for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, were purchased from what was left of a $ 1 million fund that <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to place in a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank. The money was to cover the expenses that arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> would incur when selling 80 Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The deal broke down after the first shipment of 18 missiles because the Iranians were dissatisfied with the weapons they received. As a result, `` a substantial windfall was left'' in the account of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resources </LOCATION>, a Panamanian company controlled by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in the filing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Aided by this infusion'' of cash, which the 1987 congressional Iran-Contra report estimated was $ 800,000, `` the enterprise shipped a subststantial quanity of weapons to the Contras'' in December of that year, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` Thus, the events of November afforded North his first opportunity to exploit arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in order to support the Contras; the stage wa set for the diversion of 1986,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. During his testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee hearings on the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the idea of using arms-sale profits to help the Contras was mentioned by <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON> during discussions held to set up the February 1986 sale of 1,000 <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Recalling the Jan. 22, 1986, meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON> `` suggested several incentives to make that February transaction work, and the attractive incentive for me was ... that residuals would flow to support the Nicaraguan resistance.'' <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 10,000 for each of the 1,000 <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles, which were to be purchased from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the next day, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> _ `` in a critical misrepresentation'' _ told two <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials and a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officer that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> would pay the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> $ 6,000 per missile or $ 6 million in all _ `` when he well knew that $ 10 million was the negotiated price.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> eventually set the price at $ 3,700 per missile _ `` for reasons unrelated to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s statements,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. In his latest summary of evidence in the case, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said prosecutors `` will demonstrate at trial that <PERSON> North </PERSON> played a significant role in directing expenditures from the enterprise through witnesses such as <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>,'' an American lawyer who operates a Swiss financial company. North and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> are charged along with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> with conspiring to divert more than $ 14 million in arms-for-hostage profits to the Contras. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are to be tried separately after <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s filing was made as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> concluded seven days of closed hearings to consder <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s objections to censoring sensitive information from 395 prosecution exhibits The independent prosecutor, in a separate filing, suggested a procedure under which uncensored documents could be shown to jurors, the judge and the witness without revealing the contents to spectators. The arms deals continued, but by the summer of 1986 `` fissures began to develop in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s scheme'' after the Iranians learned they were being overcharged as much as 600 percent, apparently when they obtained a price list for spare parts. North asked the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to generate a phony price list to `` extinguish the complaints.'' When confronted by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> with <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON>'s complaints, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s reaction `` was to question the trustworthiness of <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON>. `` Thus, <PERSON> North </PERSON> repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin of the inflated prices _ his own efforts to generate a surplus for the Contras. Instead, he attempted to cover his tracks and blame the problem on <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. In early October 1986, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> warned then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and deputy director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> that he suspected North and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> were diverting profits to the Contras. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> also warned that `` <PERSON> Ghorbanifar </PERSON> might go public with allegations concerning the pricing of the weapons.'' North was fired from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> resigned in late November 1986 after the diversion was confirmed in a memo unearthed by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s investigation

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 1 million Friday for a man who is charged in a 1986 slaying and is a half-brother of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has been in jail without bail since September, when he was charged in the death of <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and turned himself in to authorities. Bail had not been posted by late Friday afternoon. Indictments accuse <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> native and self-described millionaire, of hiring a group of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rukn </LOCATION> street gang members to travel to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> and kill <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a former employee in one of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s companies. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 46, also is charged with conspiring to kill a witness to <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s killing. Five El Rukn members also are charged. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has maintained that he is a victim of a political conspiracy caused partly by the success of his half-brother. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> share the same father, but the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent contact with his half-brother. Last week, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s lawyers asked that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> be granted bail under a state law that requires defendants be released when two terms of court had been completed without trial. Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Friday that he agreed with the argument `` because of the court's concern for a fair trial.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s decision marked the end of a three-month legal battle over the issue of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s right to be granted bail. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> would be required to put up $ 500,000 in the form of a surety bond plus $ 500,000 in the form of a personal recognizance bond. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> would be required to remain in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> until his trial, scheduled to begin Jan. 16. A personal recognizance bond means a defendant is liable for the amount of the bond, but he does not have to offer documentation that he has the money. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also agreed Friday that the murder charges against <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and the charges involving the attack on the murder witness should be tried separately, to avoid prejudice.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has yet to name a black to any high-level position, has pledged to put a black in his Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meantime, reiterated his promise to make the Cabinet representative of women and minorities. `` Stay tuned,'' he told reporters. The vice president continued his string of meetings with various interest groups. He spent about 30 minutes with <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> before a session with 13 conservatives, including <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feulner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Feulner </PERSON> said the conservatives urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to place people of their philosophical bent in high positions. `` In effect what we urged was that he make sure that all parts of the -LRB- conservative -RRB- coalition continue to have a stake in his success once he becomes president,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also encouraged to make greater use of his veto power to prevent an `` erosion of power'' from the executive branch. Conservatives do not want to see <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> attain too much power, particularly in foreign affairs, <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. Also among the conservatives on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON>, a black businessman from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> who has been mentioned as a possible secretary of housing and urban development. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is thought to have the inside track for that job. Hooks, a Democrat, said his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` very cordial.'' The two discussed personnel appointments in all levels of government and the judiciary, as well as issues of concern to blacks, he said. Asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had made a commitment to place a black in the Cabinet, Hooks replied: `` To the best of my recollection, I think I do remember him saying there would be a black in the Cabinet.'' Hooks then said he had a `` distinct recollection that he said he intends to do that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has named about a dozen people to top jobs in his administration so far, only one of them female and none of them black. Hooks, a vocal critic of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights policies, said he was confident that his group would have better relations with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I expect a much better civil rights record from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. Hooks said he asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to think about convening a White House conference on race and poverty next year, an idea he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to consider. Meantime, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, co-director of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office, said he still was trying to decide whether to accept the post of deputy White House chief of staff under <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, but that he has been assured direct access to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he does take it. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, whose polling data and strategy advice helped propel <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to victory in November, said he will decide in `` the next few days'' whether to take the job or return to his home in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with his wife and two children. `` I do n't know what I'm going to do yet,'' he said in a telephone interview. In talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said, it has been agreed that he could fill the dual role of presidential counselor and deputy chief of staff.

 West Germans on Friday demanded curbs on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military flights over this densely populated country to halt the toll from crashes that have killed 100 people this year. Several <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, temporarily suspended training flights after Thursday's fiery crash of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane that killed five people, but there were calls for permanent cuts. The governor of the state where the A-10 Thunderbolt II crashed said he will take the issue to the federal Parliament. Another governor urged Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. On any given day in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the sky is filled with the screechings and rumbles of hundreds of jets and helicopters, and massive opposition has been fueled by recent tragedies. Even before Thursday's fatal crash in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, 12 major accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year. They included 70 who died from an air show crash in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> in August. The resistance took on added urgency after the A-10 plowed into <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, a city of 130,000 about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Seal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and four people on the ground were killed and 50 others were injured. Two dozen homes were destroyed. The exact cause of the crash was under investigation, but West German air force Gen. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Jungkurth </PERSON> said the pilot `` may have become disoriented when he tried to climb in heavy cloud cover'' to get out of bad weather. However, the state prosecutor for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, said witnesses reported seeing one of the plane's two engines on fire before it crashed. Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> team that went to <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION> after the accident, said `` pilot error is one of the conclusions they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigators -RRB- could come to. But there is no way to comment on the likely cause ahead of that.'' Meanwhile, state Interior Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnoor </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials of hindering initial rescue operations. `` It took hours before the fire department found out from the Americans what was in the aircraft,'' he told regional radio WDR. `` At first, there was concern that there could be radioactive material on board.'' The jet, designed to support ground forces and fight tanks, was carrying 1,000 rounds of 30mm training ammunition when it crashed, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. One rescuer said ammunition periodically exploded after the initial crash, hindering rescue operations. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and West German Defense Minster <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> visited the site Friday. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> denied the flight was a low-level mission, saying the A-10 was flying between 2,500 feet and 3,300 feet before it began to descend. In West German military parlance, low-level flights range from 250 to 500 feet above the ground and are restricted to seven rural areas in the country. But the number of training accidents in recent years has aroused widespread concern in a country of 61 million people with an area smaller than <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafontaine </PERSON>, the popular, leftist governor of <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state, said on <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, should start to work immediately for a ban on low-level training flights and mock air battles over inhabited areas. `` I am calling for negotiations with the allies, as well as a corresponding decision for the German military, towards the goal of eliminating any danger to the populace,'' <PERSON> Lafontaine </PERSON> told reporters in the state capital of <LOCATION> Saarbruecken </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Rau </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> state where the accident occurred, said he will go to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to seek a reduction of low-level flights over his state. `` I hope that finally all low-level flights over densely populated areas will be banned, not just until Christmas but permanently,'' <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilz </PERSON>, a leading Christian Democrat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said he and many of his party colleagues are demanding a 30-percent reduction in low-level training missions. Seven <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations, including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, fly a combined 70,000 low-level training flights in this country each year, more than in any other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> land, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it will bar training missions below 10,700 feet until the end of the year and called on the nation's allies to observe a similar moratorium. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to the temporary suspension to be lifted in January.

<HEAD>Sunken Garden Reveals Toxic Wastes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple who was able to move into a house through a county rent subsidy were packing to leave it Friday, three months after their garden collapsed into a sinkhole of decaying automotive batteries and they learned they were living on one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s toxic `` superfund'' sites. `` I thought we had gone through the toughest part,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON>. `` When we got this place, I thought we were finally on the right track and we could settle.'' County officials made a `` bureaucratic mistake'' when they moved <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> and his family into the home last March, said <PERSON> Marice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashe </PERSON>, director of health education for <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` No one should live there,'' she said. She said tests showed that lead levels in the ground around the property, which has been on the state's toxic cleanup list since 1986, were not seriously high but were `` on the borderline of posing a health threat'' to the <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> children. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, 12, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>, 4, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 3, have been living in temporary quarters while the move is arranged. The Piazzas spent five years living in a 25-year-old school bus and a hotel before county housing authorities helped them move into the $ 850-a-month house last March. The Piazzas paid $ 167 of the monthly total; the county subsidized the rest. <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> said owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> warned him there `` was a very slight contamination in the back behind the fence. But that's at least 50 feet away and I knew the kids would n't be playing back there.'' So they relaxed and planted a vegetable garden in the front yard. On Sept. 10, <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> left the water on in the garden overnight. He awoke to find a hole about three feet deep and six feet wide where the garden had been, and a sinkhole filled with old automotive battery parts. It's now about 15 feet wide, <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> said. `` I was so shocked it took a few minutes for me just to get my thoughts together,'' he said. `` It caused a lot of scared confusion in our minds because we did n't know what it had done to us or our kids.'' `` Here we had been growing vegetables on top of all those things and eating the crops for more than two months,'' <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> said. Cost of the cleanup is estimated at $ 1 million. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters approved a state superfund program in November 1984 to raise funds to clean up toxic waste sites, modeled after the federal superfund program. The <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> site was reported to county health authorities in 1985, and was put on the state cleanupt list the following year, though not at the top. The county advised the state health department that the cleanup could be put off a few years because an elderly couple aware of the possible contamination problem was living there. Lead is particularly dangerous for children. State health spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said then-owner R.D. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> agreed to notify the county if property use changed. But deputy district attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> failed to notify the county when he sold the property. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the county knew he had planned to sell the land. According to <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> is legally and financially liable for the cleanup, which could cost up to $ 1 million.

<HEAD>Convicted Group Of Sanctuary Workers Appeal Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer for eight <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> sanctuary workers told a federal appeals court Friday the defendants believed the Central American aliens they aided were refugees with a right to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigar </PERSON> told a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that a trial judge in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, improperly barred the sanctuary workers from presenting evidence of their beliefs concerning the refugees from strife-torn nations. A government attorney, urging the court to uphold the convictions of all eight defendants, said it was clear the workers never believed they were acting legally and knew that smuggling aliens was against the law. There was no immediate ruling on the appeal. At a news conference following the court session, one of those convicted, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchison </PERSON>, vowed that the sanctuary movement would go on regardless of the outcome of the case. `` We have a duty to respond to the violated in our midst,'' she said. The eight, including five clergymen, were convicted on various charges of conspiracy, transporting and harboring and aiding illegal entry of aliens in a highly publicized 1986 trial. All received probation. Several other defendants were acquitted, pleaded guilty to misdemeanors or won dismissal of charges. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, who prosecuted the case in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said their conspiracy was clearly illegal. `` In this case, these defendants were methodically smuggling these aliens into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Everything they were doing was surreptitious and clandestine.'' He said the defendants had falsified documents and urged aliens to lie to immigration officers when asked about their country of origin. <PERSON> Tigar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> described for the judges his interpretation of the law governing refugees: `` Anyone who is a refugee ... has the right to have that status recognized regardless of his mode of entry -LRB- into the country -RRB-,'' he said. `` Refugee status is something you have because of something that happened to you in your country of origin.'' He said all of the defendants had offered to prove at trial that all the people they assisted were eligible for refugee status. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, however, accused <PERSON> Tigar </PERSON> of arguing `` a legal fiction that refugees are entitled to reside here.'' <PERSON> Tigar </PERSON> also argued that the defendants' First Amendment rights were violated when a government informant secretly recorded church services and Bible classes where sanctuary was discussed. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> responded that none of that evidence was ever used at the trial, but said it was proper because the church had been transformed from `` an appropriate exercise of religion on Sunday to a criminal enterprise on Monday.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hutchison </PERSON> said the defendants believed they were acting legally. `` When immigration authorities violate the rights of those seeking asylum, we have a responsibility to protect those rights,'' she said. `` It is humane, it is moral and it is legal, and we will continue until the violation stops.'' Supporters of the defendants presented to reporters a woman now seeking asylum. <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> said she was imprisoned and tortured in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for belonging to a union.

<HEAD>Christmas Carol Festival Canceled Because of Whites-Only Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A yearly multiracial Christmas carol festival has been canceled because the lakeside park where it would be held has been declared a `` whites only'' area, organizers said Friday. The sing has taken place at <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, the main park in this industrial town east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, for four years, but the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> administration that just took over has resegregated the park. The <ORGANIZATION> Boksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publicity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it canceled the event because of that. Conservatives won control of the <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> council and dozens of others in local elections Oct. 26. The <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> council voted to restore `` whites only'' status to the town hall, park and other facilities that were open to all races in recent years. Anti-apartheid leaders, business groups and the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denouced the action, and blacks have begun a consumer boycott of white-owned stores. Several government officials who criticized the Conservatives come from cities where beaches, libraries and swimming pools are segregated.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should n't try to greatly reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending in response to a Soviet pledge to cut troop strength. `` Let's not forget that the reason that we're making success with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the world is because we have been able to negotiate from a position of strength,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who developed a reputation as a hard-liner on defense issues while in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said that even if <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> follows through on a promise to reduce Soviet troops by 500,000, the Soviets still will `` have a very significant advantage'' in troops and weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't try to undercut us and to take away that position of strength,'' he said. `` I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't respond and say, ` Well, we can dramatically cut defense spending.''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, commenting on a wide range of topics in an interview with reporters from his home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, denied suggestions he has been swayed by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team in making staff appointments and other decisions. Referring to the appointment of Time correspondent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, who was more closely associated with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to be his press secretary, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` It was at my initiative. The appointments I make will be my appointments and I will be making those decisions on what I think is best for me and the administration.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he would be `` a very close personal confidential adviser to the president'' during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s term, and also would focus on his duties as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, as overseer of the administration's space council, as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and as a promoter of education and job training programs. Asked why he had left anti-drug efforts off his list of priorities, since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had led <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration programs in that area, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his role had not been determined under new legislation that calls for appointment of a drug czar. He steered clear of speculation over whom <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> will appoint to fill the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will vacate, saying, `` He'll make a good choice, a choice I will support.'' The vice president-elect also met Friday with conservative Eagle Forum leader <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> national security aides <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> and Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters outside his house that in the meeting with <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, whom he characterized as an old friend, they discussed <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' area of specialty at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declined to specify what direction the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will take on the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> situation and aid to the Contra rebels, saying `` those will be major issues, and major strategy we'll have to formulate,'' but that he could not elaborate on it this early. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, whose Iran-Contra testimony revealed he had deceived <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the secret operation to assist the Nicaraguan rebels, told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> he definitely was leaving government to return to private life, the senator said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the hardest adjustment he's had to make since becoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice president-elect is learning to live with the tight security detail that tracks his every move. The father of three said he misses `` just sort of now being able to get in the car and drive down to <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s drive-in and get a milkshake with the kids if you want to.'' `` We consider ourselves a strong, durable family,'' he continued. `` When you get tested, you actually become close and you become strengthened in many ways, but it is different.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the criticism and ridicule he received during the campaign were difficult to deal with, but `` we knew it was unfair and wrong. We knew in due time things would be adjusted. You do n't like it but it's part of the political system.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief accepted the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize check Friday on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces, but he said they are threatened because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries wo n't pay their dues. `` I do n't know how we're going to cope financially,'' Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said before receiving the prize money of $ 416,000 _ a fraction of the $ 450 million in dues owed by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members. `` In some ways it's embarrassing because it forces me to say publicly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still owes the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> almost $ 350 million,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. `` Yesterday I had a meeting with American congressmen who complimented me on the peacekeeping forces,'' he said. `` I did n't want to make a joke, but I told them I thought it would be kind of a posthumous homage to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ... We wo n't have enough funds, because you are not paying your contribution.'' Asked when the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> would pay its own peacekeeping force bills to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries that provide troops, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said: `` They are all understanding. They think we are honest people. But unfortunately, not everyone is honest with us.'' Commenting on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force to monitor a truce as Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he said: `` First of all let us see if a cease-fire is possible. ... It is of course not a very simple question.'' On Saturday, Perez de Cuellar receives the traditional gold medal and certificate from the <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in a ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Aula Hall. The check handover Friday broke with tradition. It is usually awarded after the ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish philanthropist <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, inventor of dynamite. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief was flying to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> immediately after the ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Human Rights Convention. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> cited progress on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war and conflicts in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` I have the impression that all of a sudden so many countries have discovered that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is really an extremely useful mechanism for maintaining peace,'' he said. The first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operation was in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in 1948. Since then, half a million men have served in 15 separate operations, and more than 700 have been killed. Seven missions are currently in the field. In a report this week, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> predicted the world body would end next year with a loss of $ 24.6 million. Only 79 of the 159 members had paid all their dues by Nov. 30, the report said. He said Friday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> owed about $ 100 million, but he praised the Soviets for seting a payment schedule and sticking with it.

<HEAD>French, Soviet Spacemen Overcome Snags to Deploy Test Platform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A French cosmonaut and a Soviet colleague overcame problems outside the orbiting space station Mir on Friday and unfurled a plastic web in a test of space construction techniques, Soviet media reported. <PERSON> Jean-Loup </PERSON> <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> began their spacewalk at 12:57 p.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 4 a.m. EDT -RRB- and were scheduled to complete it in four hours, 20 minutes, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. But the spacewalk lasted six hours because of several problems. It took longer than expected to lay a cable linking the plastic structure's platform to the control panel inside Mir, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Then the structure failed to unfold on the electronic command of cosmonaut <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON>, who was inside Mir. While scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> studied the problem, the cosmonauts were out of radio contact. When contact was restored, the cosmonauts exclaimed: `` It's opened! Soviet television reported. The cosmonauts evidently shook the structure to open it, a TV correspondent said. If it proves reliable, the platform could be used to hold antennas and telescope mirrors. Also during the spacewalk, <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> mounted outside Mir a panel with samples of different materials and coatings. After six months, the panel is to be removed and taken back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for study of how the materials and coatings withstood sharp temperature fluctuations and solar radiation in space, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviets have said they intend to build large structures in space for research, and the techniques and materials the cosmonauts tested Friday should help plan such projects. Soviet television provided live coverage of parts of the spacewalk.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> launched a criminal investigation Friday into the downing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locust-spraying plane over the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> in the heart of an area controlled by the Marxist-led Polisario independence movement. Meanwhile, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said his view is that whoever shot the plane down `` make a mistake. These were not military planes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is looking for possible violations of federal criminal laws, including one that deals with destruction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft overseas, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> said. In opening the investigation, the bureau did not specifically invoke a 1986 anti-terrorism law which makes it a crime to kill <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nationals outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Five Americans aboard the DC-7 were presumed dead when the craft was shot down Thursday by a surface-to-air missile. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, deputy administrator of AID, told reporters the plane, and another craft accompanying it, were in no sense on a mission for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the planes had been en route from <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, where they had finished work for AID, to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, where they `` were going to ... seek another job'' spraying locusts for AID. <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> said the downed aircraft had been under contract to AID, but that the contract expired Wednesday. Negotiations were under way to extend the contracts when the aircraft was shot down, <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> added. Asked if the plane crews had been warned of the risk involved in flying over the area, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't think anyone knew they were running a risk.'' `` My own view is that who ever did it made a mistake,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` These were not military planes.'' <PERSON> Madjid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, the Polisario's North American representative, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the front `` will do everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and unfortunate incident.'' Both aircraft were owned by <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G Aviation of <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and were under contract to AID to spray insects, said <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G co-owner <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomassoni </PERSON>, who was in the other plane that was hit. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the contracts of the five men presumed dead have been extended to spare their families the expense of transporting the bodies back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for burial. `` We view this as a tragic and deplorable loss of innocent life in an effort, really, to save life,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the men were part of an international effort to stop `` one of the most massive insect infestations in decades, a plague really of biblical proportions.''

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should n't be based entirely on the pronouncements and personality of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, since there's no guarantee he'll stay in power, former secretaries of state said Friday. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acts as he does because he recognizes that the Soviet economy is a mess and it has to be improved,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, secretary of state under former presidents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, told a news conference. `` It's a big mistake to gear our policies totally to one Soviet personality.'' <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, who directed foreign policy under presidents <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faces an uphill battle in bringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fall from power if he fails. `` I think he may be gone in a couple of years,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a secretary of state under <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should `` continue the policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. ... I think the prospects for peace are very good, -LRB- but -RRB- we have to remain strong militarily.'' The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretaries of state were here for the Sixth Annual Report from the Secretaries of State, sponsored by the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipscomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They spoke with reporters before taping a two-hour television special to be broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> stations early next year. There was some disagreement with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> reacted sharply to president's suggestion Thursday that there be talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> regarding the Lebanese hostages. `` I am violently opposed to any negotiations about hostages, ever,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. `` Once you begin negotiating on the release of hostages, you have indicated there is the price and the only thing left to negotiate is the price _ and therefore, hostage taking has a reward.'' `` I know this sounds cruel, I know this is tough on the families, but I believe that devaluing hostages is the only way you can prevent hostages from being taken.'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, secretary of state under former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, both predicted the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be released because it will be in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s interest to try to return relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to normal. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's refusal to admit <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Yassar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, calling it `` a serious mistake.'' `` It helped those who were opposed to progress in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and it disadvantaged those who would like to see us get the peace process going ahead,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. `` I think it makes it more difficult for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to act as an honest broker in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must maintain a strong military, but said, `` We must remain strong economically as well as militarily.'' `` I think one of the things he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is going to have to deal with, strongly and effectively, is the twin deficits, the budget deficit and the trade deficit. ... What he does in regard to that particular issue is going to have a major effect, in the long run, on our foreign policy.'' The forum was held at the invitation of Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>, a trustee of the non-profit international studies organization.

<TEXT>
 A would-be financial adviser who bilked investors out of $ 15 million to finance a lifestyle of expensive art and luxury homes was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison by a judge who called him `` amoral, not immoral.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, 24, whose swindle earned him the title `` Wall Street Whiz Kid,'' pleaded guilty in March to one count each of mail fraud and securities fraud. Most of the investors he conned were friends of his parents, prosecutors said. `` I have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> told the judge. He conceded he was `` deserving of punishment'' but his attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, sought leniency, saying <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> was `` a greedy young man and a product of our times.'' `` When he grew up, greed was on the ascendency,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> should n't wind up being the scapegoat of the 1980s.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said he found <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> `` remorseless, completely lacking in conscience. He was a predator, completely insensitive.'' The judge said he was imposing the stiff sentence because it was `` absolutely essential'' to send a message to those who act through `` greed and insatiable lust for despoiling innocent people.'' The prosecution said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> used deceit and fraud to parlay a college investment club into a multimillion-dollar investment operation with about 140 clients. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who was not registered as an investment adviser, attracted investors to his now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by falsely claiming his clients included the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family and entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. Bloom, a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate with an art history degree, told clients he was putting their money into the stock market when he actually was using it to pay for his own lavish lifestyle. He had art works worth $ 5.5 million, an $ 830,000 condominium on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach house worth $ 1.9 million, and two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> _ worth $ 200,000. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> sent his investors bogus account statements that claimed to show their securities holdings, according to the charges. He also was charged with using new clients' funds to pay `` profits'' to older clients. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> to four years on each count and, ordered the terms to run consecutively. `` He went on his way without any thought of the pain, suffering and misery he was inflicting,'' said <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. `` He was amoral, not immoral.'' The judge said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> had `` cannibalized his family and friends.'' He also ordered Bloom to make full restitution. No fine was imposed. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> could have sentenced <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> to 10 years in prison and fined him $ 20 million. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> brought civil charges against <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who settled by agreeing to turn over his assets to a court-appointed receiver and to stay out of the securities industry for the rest of his life. Bloom neither admitted nor denied the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> allegations, but criminal charges were brought in March. He waived indictment and pleaded guilty March 31 to one count each of mail and securities fraud.

<HEAD>Two-Thirds Of Inmates On Work Release At Non-Traditional Prison Are
Murderers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JESSUP, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two-thirds of the inmates granted work-release status at the controversial Patuxent Institution are murderers and nearly 60 percent are serving life terms, according to prison statistics. The Patuxent Institution, which emphasizes rehabilitation through psychotherapy, came under criticism last week when convicted rapist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavarakas </PERSON> fled while on work-release and allegedly raped a woman in <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>. He was arrested Sunday. Earlier, it was revealed that triple killer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> was granted several unsupervised furloughs. Citing the criticism and <PERSON> Stavarakas </PERSON>' escape, the Patuxent board of review voted Dec. 1 to suspend all furloughs and work release programs indefinitely. Lifers turn up more often in Patuxent's work-release and leave programs than do inmates from the prison's general population, according to the figures released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. While those serving life sentences represent about one in five Patuxent inmates, they make up 59 percent of those on work-release and 28 percent of those on leave, the figures showed. The figures also showed that inmates serving life terms at Patuxent serve only half as much time as do lifers at other <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prisons before they are granted parole. The 16 Patuxent lifers paroled from July 1, 1977, to June 30, 1988, served an average of 8.4 years before release. Life inmates at other <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prisons are confined 17 years on average before parole, saidDr. <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluckstern </PERSON>, Patuxent's director. Patuxent is unusual because of the wide authority given to prison officials to grant leaves to inmates, although a 1982 law requires approval by the governor before an inmate serving for life is paroled. Several state lawmakers have suggested that further restrictions be placed on the prison's governing board. Inmates are sent to Patuxent because correction officials consider them more likely to be rehabilitated through its program of psychological and psychiatric counseling.

 Officials on Friday tried to determine who shot down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locust-spraying plane, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team reported trouble in reaching the wreckage in a remote area used by rebels to launch attacks. The investigators told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION> by telephone the wreckage of the DC-7 lay in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> within a 25-mile-wide strip between <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> and the most forward positions along a 2,000-mile defense wall built by <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. That confirmed earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite data placing the site in the heart of an area the Marxist-led Polisario independence movement in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> uses to group its forces. A surface-to-air missile downed the plane Thursday morning and damaged another plane that managed to land safely. `` At this point, we still do n't know who fired the missile,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday. Asked whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials thought it was a terrorist incident, he said, `` Well, we do n't know yet. A lot depends on something we do n't know yet, which is who did it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts said the site was a few miles east of <PERSON> Daddar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahlou </PERSON>, a desert outpost halfway between the Mauritanian border and the defensive wall <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> erected to guard the most valuable part of the phosphate-rich territory. The spot is about 650 miles south of <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>, the capital of this North African country. The plane was chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Reports said it exploded at an altitude of about 10,000 feet and that the five occupants, all Americans, were presumed to be dead. The wreckage was scattered over a wide area. A second DC-7 chartered by AID to help fight the locust plague in northern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also was hit by a missile, but limped 250 miles and land safely at <LOCATION> Sidi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ifni </LOCATION>. It sat at the end of the single runway Friday, and the <PERSON> Sidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ifni </PERSON> airport was closed. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tommasoni </PERSON>, 64, co-owner of the <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, aviation company that owned both planes, was crew chief of the second plane. He and the other four men aboard were reported safe in <LOCATION> Agadir </LOCATION>. The American investigators were experiencing `` unusual difficulties'' in reaching the site, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts said. They did not elaborate. The Americans aboard the downed plane were identified as <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 21, both of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>, 49, <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hederman </PERSON>, 47, <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said she talked with her husband by telephone on Wednesday night and expected him to be home by Monday. `` They knew there were border disputes, but they evidently did n't think that had anything to do with them,'' she said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> KKAR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> It was widely assumed, though not confirmed officially, that both missiles were fired by a guerrilla unit. Polisario fighters in the area usually have Soviet-designed SAM missiles for defense against Moroccan aircraft. Both DC-7s were flying at 10,000 to 11,000 feet, generally considered too high for visual identification. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official said privately it was `` at least possible'' the attackers thought the planes were Moroccan. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has been brought into the case to investigate who fired the missile at the planes and why. <PERSON> Madjid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, the Polisario's North American representative, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the front `` will do everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and unfortunate incident.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has no interest in creating an incident with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and declared that <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> must assume responsibility for sending civilian planes over an area with a `` huge concentration'' of Polisario forces. The government of <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> issued a statement Friday denouncing what it called `` this act of barbarism.'' It said the victims were `` shot down coldly while they were fulfilling a humanitarian duty.'' <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> rarely comments on events in the 14-year-old war with Polisario, but habitually claims its defensive wall runs flush with the Mauritanian border. <PERSON> Tommasoni </PERSON> described the two-hour trip in the crippled plane to <PERSON> Sidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ifni </PERSON> as `` hairy.'' `` We lost altitude. We were 25 to 30 feet above the ground most of the way,'' he said by telephone from his hotel room in <LOCATION> Agadir </LOCATION>. `` We had a load of insecticide aboard and we dumped it and were able to gain some altitude.'' The planes left <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, early Thursday morning for <ORGANIZATION> Agadir </ORGANIZATION> to join the battle against locusts. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> annexed the former <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> withdrew in 1975 and Moroccan positions were attacked soon afterward by Polisario guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Fighting has continued despite <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s construction of the wall. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plans to organize a referendum among the 80,000 people who lived in the territory under Spanish rule and their children. The two sides have not agreed, however, on exactly who should be allowed to vote or a plan for withdrawing Moroccan forces.

 Federal police and Western intelligence agencies have broken a spy ring that was supplying <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper called it `` a huge blow against the Soviet secret service,'' the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Detlev </PERSON> <PERSON> Achammer </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that `` three people are being investigated for suspicion of espionage.''

The owner, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, threw the parties at his casino last April and April 1986, according to one count of the state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> complaint. The incidents `` have become public knowledge throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in certain foreign countries and reflect or tend to reflect on the repute of the state of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and act as a detriment to its gaming industry,'' the complaint said. A second count alleges <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> destroyed or concealed evidence relevant to an unrelated civil action stemming from a 1984 rape case at the Imperial Palace. The complaint seeks a fine of up to $ 400,000 for the alleged violations, plus the possible revocation, suspension or restriction of <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s gaming license. No date has been set for a state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the board's complaint. During the hearing, commission members will act as judges and control board members will act as prosecutors. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Engelstad </LOCATION>; he would not take reporters' calls at his casino Friday and no other spokesman was immediately available. In October, <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> issued a public apology for the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> parties, saying they were `` not only stupid, but insensitive.'' The complaint alleges the two <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday celebrations were held around April 20, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birthday. It alleges they featured cakes decorated with swastikas, Nazi-era German marching music and German food. Bartenders at the parties wore T-shirts bearing a picture of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and the message `` <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> _ European Tour 1939-45,'' according to the complaint. The complaint claimed the celebrations were held in the Imperial Palace's so-called `` War Room,'' which housed <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s collection of memorabilia from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Third Reich, including a portrait of himself in a Nazi uniform. The complaint also alleges the Imperial Palace's print shop was used in August 1986 to print 500 bumper stickers stating `` Hitler Was Right.''

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Competing For Use of Controversial Radar,
Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet scientists are competing with each other to develop a research project for the scientific use of a controversial military radar, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Guriy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON>, who leads the Soviet academy, said that at least four scientific uses for the large radar station at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> have been proposed to the academy, but no final decision has been made. The radar, located in a remote sector of central <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, was turned over to the Soviet academy by Soviet president <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration claimed that it was a violation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The radar is neither on the edge of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nor is it pointed outward, as is required by the ABM treaty. It is believed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts that the radar was built for the detection and tracking of ballistic missiles. <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON>, who lectured Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, was asked what the Soviet academy planned to do with the radar. `` We do n't know,'' <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON> replied through an interpreter. `` We have declared a competition or contest'' to find the best use for the radar station. `` We have at least four projects suggesting what we should do with it,'' he added. He said the proposals include both space and atmospheric research. <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON>, speaking to an audience of American researchers, said that scientists everywhere may participate in the competition. `` I invite all of those with ideas to come up with proposals and send them to us,'' he said. In his lecture, <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now is applying democratic principles in selecting the scientific leadership of the nation. He said there are about 520 academic institutions in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and that they all recently selected new leaders on a `` competitive basis.'' `` More than half of the academic institutions now are headed by young people,'' said <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON>. `` This is possible only in the atmosphere of democracy.'' The academy president said he regarded this as a good development for Soviet science because `` the best ideas come into the minds of people under the age of 30. After 30 they just develop their ideas.'' <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON> gave the lecture on the opening day of a conference marking the 30th year of cooperatation and exchange between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal savings and loan regulators on Friday pledged $ 1.05 billion to shut down an insolvent <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> institution in one of the nation's biggest S & amp; L failures. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates federally insured S & amp; Ls, created a new institution to receive $ 1.7 billion in deposits of the <ORGANIZATION> Silverado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which was ordered closed by <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> regulators. After the failed institution's assets are liquidated, federal regulators expect to have spent slightly more than $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> joins only a handful of financial institutions that have cost government insurance funds that much to close or rescue. In the largest-ever clean-up of a single insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L _ the pending rescue of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ the bank board estimates it will spend $ 2 billion. In the case of <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>, the bank board's insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is pumping $ 200 million in cash to the new, government-owned institution, <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and pledging another $ 624 million in a promissory note. Starting Monday, all <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> depositors with accounts under the insurance limit of $ 100,000 will be able to deposit and withdraw money as usual at the new Mile High. The bank board is hiring <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> to manage Mile High. It appointed a five-member board of directors, headed by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The current stockholders and manager wo n't benefit from the transaction, the bank board said. The institution's president, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, controlled about 90 percent of the stock. The bank board attributed the failure to `` substantial dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules and regulations.'' It said <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> had swapped some of its preferred stock for undeveloped land owned by developers. Regulators said <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> was losing money on many of its loans and that much of its investments were direct interests in risky commercial real estate ventures, rather than in the traditional S & amp; L business of home mortgage lending. The bank board has closed, merged or otherwise `` resolved'' the cases of 148 insolvent S & amp; Ls so far this year, a post-Depression record, spending or pledging to spend about $ 23 billion. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, bank board chairman, said last week that he hoped to have resolved 200 cases by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> on Friday gave preliminary approval to a program to bail out <ORGANIZATION> Tracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Under the program <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> will merge with the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> to create a bank with total assets of approximately $ 600 million. In a separate action, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> also allowed <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to purchase <LOCATION> Caribank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dania </PERSON> as a national bank subsidiary. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> had been named receiver for <PERSON> Caribank </PERSON> when <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s comptroller closed it Friday. About 400 of 3,000 S & amp; Ls are insolvent and estimates of the cost of the total clean-up range up to $ 100 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is working on a plan for President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aimed at directing more money to the resolutions without adding substantially to the federal budget deficit.

 Bad weather and technical glitches forced a delay of at least 24 hours in the launch of an Ariane 4 rocket carrying satellites for direct television broadcasts and British military signals. The countdown at the space center on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION> was halted just six minutes before the planned liftoff at 9:01 p.m. -LRB- 7:01 p.m. EST -RRB- to let a threatening storm cloud pass by. It was resumed 20 minutes later, only to be stopped automatically when there was a failure in the computerized link with the tracking station on <LOCATION> Ascension </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Allest </PERSON> said. He said the liftoff was postponed until the second planned launch window, from 10:23 p.m. to 11:40 p.m. -LRB- 8:23 p.m. EST to 9:40 p.m. EST -RRB-. But just as the second launch window was opening, d'Allest said the failure of a remote sensor on the rocket's third stage would force a delay until Saturday night or Sunday. A decision was expected Saturday morning on when to reschedule the launch. It is the first commercial mission for the Ariane 4, a more powerful and more versatile version of previous Ariane rockets, developed by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a 13-member consortium led by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In June, the Ariane 4 put three satellites into orbit in a successful demonstration launch. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>'s Astra 1A satellite has the potential to change the viewing habits of millions of Western Europeans, as receiving dishes sprout on roofs and in back yards. Beginning in late January, it will be able to beam 16 channels of programming to an area that includes 85 percent of West European homes. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a Luxembourg-based consortium, announced the sale of the 11th channel Friday to the Swedish company <ORGANIZATION> Esselte </ORGANIZATION>, which plans a pay-TV film service called Filmnet. Other channels already sold will offer sports, news and movies. A competing direct-broadcast satellite, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s TDF-1, was launched by Ariane last month, but it has not yet lined up programming for its six channels. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Skynet </ORGANIZATION> 4B, the other satellite being launched, is to provide communications for submarines and surface vessels of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> navy and ground stations. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>, the company set up to handle commercial launches of the Ariane rockets, had six previous launches in 1988, all successful.

 Palestinian guerrillas battled Israeli air, naval and commando forces for nine hours Friday in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deepest raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in five years An Israeli officer and at least eight guerrillas were killed. Three Israeli soldiers and at least 16 guerrillas were wounded in the battle across hills overlooking this coastal town, 50 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border and nine miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police and Israeli army spokesmen said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said at least 20 guerrillas were killed and dozens wounded. Lebanese police said at least eight were killed. The operation ended when four <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops who had been separated from the main force and surrounded by guerrillas were plucked from the ground by two Cobra gunships and carried away clinging to the struts, an Israeli officer said. A similar rescue in 1986 saved the life of a downed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pilot. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched the raid against the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Syrian group headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, to deter further attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> -RRB- prepares incidents all the time, and we saw a great need to attack his camp from where a great many incidents of this organization are planned and organized against us,'' <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> told a news conference. Israeli officials declined to say how many troops participated in the raid, which began with a landing on bluffs east of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> at around midnight. An Israeli army spokesman said the troops maneuvered across one to two miles of rough terrain on foot to the nearby guerrilla base, then penetrated it without being detected and fought hand-to-hand before withdrawing. The Israeli officer was killed during the assault on the camp, the spokesman said. An army communique identified him as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Meital </PERSON>, 29, a commander of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Golani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said the Israeli unit was ambushed and surrounded shortly after landing. He said the Israelis responded by dispatching commandos by sea, and its warplanes mounted 20 sorties. The hostilities were over by 11:15 a.m. -LRB- 4:15 a.m. EST -RRB-, shortly after two Israeli helicopters landed near an abandoned Maronite monastery and evacuated the besieged troops, the spokesman said. The operation marked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deepest penetration into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since it withdrew from the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in September 1983, about a year after invading <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. Initial communiques released by <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group claimed 18 Israelis were captured. But later, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> acknowledged there were no captives, saying: `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army has managed even to evacuate the body of the killed officer as well as the three wounded soldiers.'' Sitting at an impromptu news conference in a tunnel in the stricken area, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> displayed a U.S.-made M-16 rifle and binoculars he said belonged to the dead Israeli officer. An aide to <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis had released several Doberman pinscher dogs fitted with tear-gas containers and explosives. `` The dogs were trained to chase our fighters in the tunnels, when the Israelis would release the gas by remote control or detonate the explosives to either force our fighters to leave the tunnels or kill them,'' he said. `` Our fighters shot the dogs,'' he said, pointing to a dead black Doberman with explosives and a gas container strapped around his belly. The police spokesman said guerrillas and allied leftist militiamen opened fire at the Israeli jets and helicopter gunships from twin-barrelled anti-aircraft guns and launched several shoulder-fired Sam-7 missiles. No hits were reported, he said. Syrian soldiers in trucks and armored personnel carriers were seen rolling south on the coastal highway when Israeli reinforcements stormed ashore at <LOCATION> Saadiyat </LOCATION>, two miles south of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. But he said there was no evidence of any <LOCATION> Syrian-Israeli </LOCATION> combat. Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as the planes thundered through the blue <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sky to stage <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 24th air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in 23 previous Israeli air raids on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Jan. 3. Black smoke and the stench of explosives shrouded <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> and its bluffs as the hostilities raged, and panicked residents deserted the town for safer areas in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many cars sped out, horns honking, from the stricken bluffs to the coastal highway. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador on Friday called for a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s raid. Ambassador <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON> made the request in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. There was no immediate response from <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials.

<HEAD>Rocard's Government Survives First Censure Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s minority government survived its first <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> censure vote early Saturday when <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> members refused to back the conservative opposition. Only 258 legislators, all members of rightist or center-right parties, voted for the censure motion. Under the French Constitution, the government is forced to resign on a censure motion only if an absolute majority _ 286 out of 571 _ votes for it, not just a majority of those voting. Only votes in favor are recorded. There are no abstentions or votes against. Six seats are vacant in the 577-member chamber of deputies, the lower house. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has been widely criticized for his handling of a series of strikes by public employees, including one that has disrupted subway, bus and suburban train service for the past two weeks. But he was in no danger of losing the censure vote. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is at an impasse,'' <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Seguin </PERSON>, speaking for the conservative Rally for the Republic party, said in the censure debate. `` A country needs to be led, to know where it's going, how it's getting there and why it's going there.'' <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> it was a `` motion of spite'' presented because the right was `` embitterred by its defeat'' in this year's presidential and legislative elections. He called the motion `` an operation of political diversion, with its result known in advance and with no effect on the political or social climate.'' The debate began Friday night and lasted past midnight. The current chamber of deputies is made up of 273 Socialists, 130 members of the Rally for the Republic, 89 from the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, 41 in the Union of the Center, 24 Communists and 14 independents. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> named <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> premier last May after winning re-election to a new seven-year term. In June's legislative elections, the Socialists fell short of winning a majority in the chamber, but did well enough to prevent the right from taking control.

 A massive worldwide outpouring of sympathy brought <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> firefighters, French search dogs, tons of tents, and blankets and medicine to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Friday to help relief for the Armenian earthquake. More dogs and medical supplies were expected to be en route soon, courtesy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Western countries, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies and even groups not recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> pledged millions of dollars of aid in a relief effort that crossed political boundaries and cut quickly through Soviet red tape. `` We are awaiting more planes from foreign countries. We badly need them and are grateful for what they are bringing us,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastoryan </PERSON>, an assistant to the director of the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Zvarnots airport About 80,000 people were killed in Tuesday's earthquake, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless. The Soviet reaction to the outpouring of help astonished some observers. `` It's unusual for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to accept assistance from foreign countries, especially the West, but this is a really unusual situation and we're doing the best we can to help out and coordinate our efforts,'' a Western European diplomat said on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials announced Friday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would charter an airplane to carry medical supplies and dog search teams to help. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government extended an offer of help Thursday. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said officials were looking for a plane and assembling teams and goods but that no details of the trip were laid out yet. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said its most pressing needs are antibiotics, syringes and needles, blood collection containers, blood substitutes, surgical thread and food concentrates. The League of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said at least 12 planeloads of emergency supplies from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> societies worldwide were expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> between Friday night and Saturday afternoon.

A French team of 180 people, including 22 doctors and 19 rescue teams, brought the first foreign relief workers to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The group brought 12 search dogs and 20 tons of medical supplies. `` We are very touched to be here and glad that we will be able to help out in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' one of the French relief officers said on television. The dogs are trained to sniff out people buried under rubble. Soviet television showed rescuers poking through the rubble with metal poles trying to detect signs of life. Television also showed the arrival of a Swiss plane with more dogs and disaster experts. A special firefighting unit from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> led by <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> Fire Inspector <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roundell </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> late Friday. A Soviet television report from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> showed the firefighters holding up special heat-sensitive cameras to detect live victims under the rubble. The four-man team previously participated in quake search efforts in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The British government also pledged $ 9.3 million. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> sent medical aid and telecommunications equipment, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> dispatched four-wheel drive vehicles, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport plane was standing by to send earth-moving equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> collected money, antibiotics and supplies, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it has been overwhemed with donations and has set up a bank account for those wishing to help. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is willing to do whatever it can to help deliver aid and materials collected through private means. But he said the administration probably would not send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government money to the Soviets. Americans of Armenian descent gathered in shops and churches around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to seek news on the quake and donate money and supplies. In <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalaydjian </PERSON>, editor of the Armenian Mirror Spectator, said despair has `` changed into determination to build again and not for decades _ for centuries.'' Organizations such as the Polish banned trade union Solidarity and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> society, neither of which is recognized by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said they were ready to help. `` Let's remember, Solidarity means also solidarity with other nations and with those who especially need such Solidarity,'' said an appeal signed by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> urged Solidarity members to contribute to a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> fund for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and the union's health service commission said it was ready to send medicine and a team of doctors and nurses. The Polish government pledged tents, sleeping bags, bandages and medicine and state-controlled television read a list of factories donating money. S.O.S. Childrens' Home, an Austrian organization, offered to construct a provisional orphanage for children who lost their parents in the quake. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said it was sending a 42-member medical team with medicine, blankets and other relief supplies.

<TEXT>
 A state public service commissioner and a former commissioner pleaded innocent Friday to federal bribery and conspiracy charges stemming from an alleged scheme to pressure a utility into settling a more than $ 400 million lawsuit. Public Service Commissioner <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, former Commissioner <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Havens </PERSON> and two businessmen were each released on $ 5,000 bond after entering innocent pleas before before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Countiss </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He set the trial for March 6. The 19-count federal grand jury indictment was made public Thursday. Charged with one count each of conspiracy are <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, 73, one of the three state public service commissioners since 1964; Havens, 52, a former commissioner who resigned Jan. 11 amid rumors he was under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 68, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> oil tycoon whose current business interests include the Nautilus exercise equipment company; and <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, 54, a <LOCATION> Corinth </LOCATION> businessman. `` I do n't like people stealing my headlines,'' quipped Little, an unsuccessful 1987 candidate for highway commissioner, as he joined the other three defendants in a packed courtroom. `` I thought would n't it be good if we could have brought <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> into <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this week,'' Havens joked. In addition to the conspiracy count, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was charged with 13 counts of travel in interstate commerce to bribe public officials; and Havens and <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> each were charged with three counts of accepting bribes. Havens is accused of taking the proceeds from a $ 50,000 loan co-signed by <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, while <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> is accused of taking $ 16,000 in cash. Havens contends he did nothing illegal because he repaid <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> says he never received the $ 16,000. Little is accused of acting as an intermediary for <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in the scheme. The charges stem from an alleged plan to have the public service commissioners tell <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials they would n't approve a 14.7 percent rate hike to pay for the utlity's portion of the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gibson </LOCATION> unless MP & amp; L agreed to an out-of-court settlement in its breach of contract lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> On Sept. 20, 1985, the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved a settlement of the utility's lawsuit against the pipeline company that totaled $ 165 million, or less than half the $ 400 million the utility had originally sought. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was retained to help settle the lawsuit, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tramuto </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for government affairs. But <PERSON> Tramuto </PERSON> said the company has changed hands several times since 1985, and the current ownership and management knows nothing about the alleged conspiracy. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, the third public service commissioner, was n't indicted

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized Friday after suffering what apparently was congestive heart failure, spokesmen said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, was taken by ambulance to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. He was admitted upon the recommendation of his physician, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, because of `` the acute onset of congestive heart failure'' Friday morning, spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was in guarded condition Friday afternoon and was expected to be in the hospital for a couple of days, said <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON>. Preliminary findings indicated <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had indeed suffered congestive heart failure and an arrhythmia, or irregularity in the heartbeat, she said. Asked to comment on allegations that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was deposed as <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president in 1986 and is now under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, had earlier faked symptoms of illness, <PERSON> Kop </PERSON> replied: `` He had a heart irregularity, and that can be pretty serious.'' He was resting comfortably with his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, nearby, and he was able to eat and was in good spirits, she said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was given chest X-rays, an EKG and diagnostic tests, but the results would not be available until Saturday, she said. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> did not have a heart attack. Congestive heart failure means the heart is unable to pump the amount of blood required by the body. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is very worried,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. `` She's in tears; she's always in tears.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> began having chest pains around 4 a.m., after learning that his pregnant daughter, <PERSON> Imee </PERSON> <PERSON> Manotoc </PERSON>, who lives in exile in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, was having medical problems and would have to deliver by Caesarian section, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Monotoc </PERSON> gave birth but her condition and that of the baby was not known, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. `` The president became so worried, sick and upset that they called the doctor,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. After <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was examined by doctors at his <LOCATION> Makiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> home, it was decided he should be hospitalized, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> arrived at the hospital shortly after noon, and was admitted after being examined in the hospital's emergency room. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spent several days at the hospital in May after suffering chest pains. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been monitored for three weeks because of an irregular heartbeat due to heart disease, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> ordered complete bed rest, and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> will not be permitted to walk around at the hospital, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cardiologist has told a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that although <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> suffers various health problems, he is well enough to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment on racketeering charges. The arraignment had been postponed after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' doctors said he was not well enough to travel. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> faked pain and other ailments during the three-hour examination, according to the report by the cardiologist, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he, <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> physicians with whom he consulted are unable to account for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' escalating and widespread pain syndrome, and say that that should not stop him from traveling or appearing in court. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted in February 1986.

 A blowtorch of dry <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> wind and blazing embers destroyed or damaged 22 expensive homes early Friday when a roaring 3000-acre brush fire chased residents from their beds in a third day of destruction. Police asked residents to evacuate threatened areas where many houses have fashionable but flammable wooden shingles, but officials did not know how many left. Schools were closed and evacuation centers were set up at campuses and a synagogue. No serious injuries were reported. The firestorm, driven by erratic gusts of up to 70 mph blasting off the desert, hit the northwestern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, adding new destruction to the 22 homes lost and many others damaged Wednesday and Thursday, when the wind toppled trucks and knocked out power to half a million customers.

<HEAD>Handel &amp; Haydn Society Revives Its Avant-Garde Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When a group of ordinary <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> merchants who liked to sing formed the <ORGANIZATION> Handel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Haydn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1815, <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> was hot and <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> was trendy. Decades passed. The amateur chorus grew musically musty. But since <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON>, a world-renowned British expert in early music, took over as artistic director in 1986, the country's oldest performing arts group has returned to its avant-garde origins. He has breathed new life into <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>'s `` Messiah'' by scraping off nearly 200 years of bigger-is-better interpretation, using period instruments and following the composer's instructions. Last year, <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> mixed jazz pianist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> with <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> to demonstrate unexpected connections. And he would like to collaborate with such unorthodox musicians as the Talking Heads, a rock band with an intellectual bent. `` I'm interested in doing some extraordinary combinations, the sort of program that really makes the audience think,'' he said during a recent interview. <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> is just as faithful to the society's baroque and classical heritage, the music that attracted this 47-year-old scholar, harpsichordist, author and conductor in the first place. After all, this was the group that performed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> premieres of <PERSON> Haydn </PERSON>'s `` The Creation'' -LRB- 1817 -RRB-, <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>'s complete `` Messiah'' -LRB- 1818 -RRB-, <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Requiem'' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- and <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>'s `` B Minor Mass'' -LRB- 1887 -RRB-. Those were the H & amp; H heydays. Some time around the turn of the century the <ORGANIZATION> Handel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Haydn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> got stuck in the past. That's when it stopped sending 600-singer choruses to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by boat It's reputation shriveled until it was known as little more than a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> chorus that sang `` Messiah'' at Christmas. This began to change in the late 1960s when conductor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> trimmed from hundreds of amateurs to a few dozen professional singers and added a small professional orchestra. Then <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> arrived. The <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> musicologist, harpsichoridist, scholar, author and conductor already was established as the sort of musician who would have suited the H & amp; H founders. In 1973, for example, he founded the Academy of Ancient Music, the first British orchestra to use instruments authentic to the baroque and classical music it performed. <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON>, 47, holds to the paradoxical philosophy that what is old can be new. That's why he favors instruments and arrangements authentic to the composer who wrote the work. As he phrased it: `` Should we put the hands back on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>? `` My feeling is toward locating what speaks to every man. If you take on the right instruments, that music will speak more natural language.'' <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON>'s deft mix of old and new touches everything. This month H & amp; H marked the 135th annual <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> performance of <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>'s `` Messiah,'' but performed for the first time on period instruments Also during December, H & amp; H performs at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, its first return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since the last century. The society is also taking `` Messiah'' to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Orchestra Hall for a debut. And the group has its first recording contract. `` It is a society, so it's more than just concerts, ... we talk to our audience. The H & amp; H demands that we be at the cutting edge,'' <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> said. Thus, when the improvisational <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> performed, he played <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, who was himself a famed improviser. That concert also included <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>, the neoclassical modern Russian composer who looked to <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> for inspiration. The program illustrated the musical threads. The public seems to like this approach, too. Its subscription list is multiplying. It has operated in the black the past four years, and the 1989 budget is $ 1.3 million for its September to April season. That's triple the 1984 budget <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> juggles his time and place between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- where he makes his home and runs the Academy of Ancient Music -RRB-, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> -LRB- where he is director of music for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, where he is artistic adviser to the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Since taking over as music director in 1986, he is quickly moving H & amp; H out into that world, showing it is alive and well and living up to the tradition of its founders. <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON>'s goal, he said, `` is to get what we are doing more defined and get it outside the confines of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.''

 Last summer, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> was grand marshal of the July 4 parade in her native <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In the new <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> movie `` High Spirits,'' <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> does n't do much cheering. She plays the unhappy wife of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON>, an American tourist who hopes to rejuvenate his marriage by taking a trip to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. They end up at <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plunkett </ORGANIZATION>, run by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> -LRB- O'Toole -RRB-, who attracts customers by advertising that the castle is haunted. Unloved by his cold-hearted wife, <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON> ends up falling in love with a beautiful ghost -LRB- <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> -RRB-. `` I decided I was going to be free from what was expected of me,'' said <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> about her new role. She has appeared in `` Coal Miner's Daughter'' with <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON> and `` National Lampoon's Vacation'' with <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, among many other films `` After the ` Vacation' movies, there was tremendous popularity and success,'' she said. `` I got photographed at a lot of airports. But if you're really established so firmly in other people's imagination, it's difficult to get out a certain range. So the actress jumped at the chance to play a negative character in `` High Spirits.'' `` I was totally relieved of having to try to make anyone like me. I could really explore a territory without worrying about it,'' <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> said. The actress was born in 1954 and lived in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> until graduating from high school. Painting was her first love, and she lived in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where she studied at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. But her dream of being an artist was short-lived and when she returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON>, whose father was a musician, pursued a career as a singer. `` I had a musical background and I ended up in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> doing studio vocals. I did anything. Pepsodent commercials. I sang in a few bands, I sang in bowling alleys. She landed a job as a background singer for the rock artist <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, but her interests soon shifted to acting and she joined a Canadian-based repertory company in the mid-1970s. She played <PERSON> Ophelia </PERSON> in a musical version of `` Hamlet'' on Canadian television, and had the same role when it was brought to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> as `` Rockabye Hamlet.'' The show flopped. `` I strangled myself on stage while smoke bombs and fires went off,'' she recalled. Movies, however, proved more successful for <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON>. Her debut came in 1977 with a bit part in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s Academy Award-winning `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>.'' She followed that with roles in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s `` Honky Tonk Freeway,'' and the adaption of the musical, `` Hair. `` That's when it started to click. I had been a painter, then I wanted to be a singer. In ` Hair,' I realized there was a tremendous amount of freedom in playing different characters. You could play a painter, play a singer. It suits my temperament.'' In 1980, <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> got to play the late country star <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> in the highly acclaimed `` Coal Miner's Daughter.'' She has warm memories of the film, especially of its star, <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON>. `` I always felt that the whole movie was a very wonderful experience and it had everything to do with <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> said. `` She did such special work, and I really think a lot of the atmosphere had to do with that she was such a wonderful person.'' <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> had known director <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> -LRB- `` <LOCATION> Mona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lisa </LOCATION>'' -RRB- and quickly agreed to be in `` High Spirits.'' The atmosphere on the set seemed to live up to the film's title. `` There are some scenes where you're watching <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, Little <PERSON> John </PERSON> -LRB- a street theater performer from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeson </PERSON> and me and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON>. All these people came together. That was fascinating,'' she said. `` Everybody did have such different approaches. It was a process of being quick on your feet all the time.'' She especially enjoyed working with <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>'s a genius, and very charming. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s got one of the all-time great reputations for having lived a life so it was a pleasure to see that he's also the ultimate professional.'' `` High Spirits'' has undergone changes since filming was completed. The producers found the plot too complicated and ended up eliminating material. <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> was unhappy with some of the alterations, but still defended the movie. `` This opened the <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> and I sat with 2,000 people who really, really enjoyed it,'' <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> said. And she was happy to play the character that got booed. `` There's a lot of encouragment to play sympathetic roles. But in this role, instead of going after someone's heart, you're going after somebody's imagination.''

 As a federal grand jury decides whether he should be prosecuted, a graduate student linked to a `` virus'' that disrupted computers nationwide last month has been teaching his lawyer about the technical subject and turning down offers for his life story. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has declined offers from movie producers, book publishers, magazines and television shows, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> is not interested,'' he said. `` He's not that kind of person. ... He's fairly shy and is n't looking for publicity.'' `` Until we get the potential criminal matter resolved,'' <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON> said, the 23-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student will remain silent, despite heavy pressure to talk. `` It's not only the media. It's computer professionals, it's the government, it's <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>. I've even heard a rumor that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to hear from him,'' said <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON> in an interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who reportedly told friends that he designed the virus that temporarily clogged about 6,000 university and military computers linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Arpanet network A virus is a rogue computer program that can duplicate itself and cripple or destroy existing computer systems. `` The grand jury investigation is continuing. They are looking for specific criminal and federal violations that may have been committed,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said Wednesday, declining to be more specific. According to search warrants authorities executed at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> universities in the days following the Nov. 2 episode, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators are reviewing statutes concerning computer fraud, wire fraud, malicious mischief and unlawful access to stored communications. `` But I ca n't say the grand jury is looking at the same thing,'' said <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>. Recently, two <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> computer experts appeared before the grand jury in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. They were computer programmer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> and graduate student <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> before beginning a doctoral program in computer science at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. The grand jury also has heard from <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Krafft </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> computer science research associate, and has reviewed <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' computer accounts from both universities The three witnesses have declined to say what questions the grand jury had asked or what information they provided the panel. According to published reports, <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> called him on the night of the outbreak to seek assistance in getting out a warning to computer operators linked to the affected system. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, is the chief scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, reportedly wrote the virus as an intellectual experiment and did not intend any harm. The program apparently was intended to live undetected in the Arpanet system in which it was first introduced and secretly make copies that would move from computer to computer. However, a design error caused it to replicate out of control in computers linked to the system. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> remains secluded at his parents' home in <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where he has been since the outbreak occurred. According to his lawyer, he's `` trying to keep busy and marking his time until this is over.'' `` He's doing volunteer work and spending a lot of time with me, teaching an ignorant lawyer about a highly technical matter,'' said <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON>.

 The boy was up to no good and his parents knew it. He was staying out late and skipping school. Strangers were coming up to his bedroom window at 2 a.m. But he swore he was n't dealing drugs The parents needed proof to set him straight and they did n't want him to get arrested. They called in <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>, an eager yellow Labrador with a remarkably effective nose. `` The dog found a quarter-ounce of coke in gram bags in a slit under his rug,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Panella </PERSON>, who trained 2-year-old <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> to locate even minute amounts of marijuana, cocaine and heroin at $ 250 a sniff. <PERSON> Panella </PERSON>, owner of K9 of <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION>, has found a lucrative new angle on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s ever-present drug trade _ working for private citizens who want their property to be drug-free _ but has also raised the ire of civil libertarians. `` In the past four months, he's been nearly every other day on a search,'' said <PERSON> Panella </PERSON>, who claims <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> has found drugs in 32 of 33 homes. `` Families and corporations are mostly interested in getting help for people on drugs, rather than arresting them. All I'm doing is finding the evidence to confront them with.'' <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> primarily breeds and trains guard dogs, but he decided to branch out after boat owners began calling him for help from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s `` zero tolerance'' policy of confiscating boats found with minimal amounts of drugs on board. One was the owner of the 135-foot luxury yacht <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> searched in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` When we got to the crew's quarters the dog just went bananas,'' <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> said. `` The owner fired the crew on the spot. He just dropped them off on the dock.'' <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> says he warns business executives that one offender can leave drug residue all over an office. But he does n't worry that the dog might also implicate drug-free employees during his searches. `` I just tell them where it is. The rest is their problem.'' Private employees are not constitutionally protected from drug searches of their workplaces, but the prospect is nevertheless disturbing to civil libertarians. `` It's funny to think of a dog as high-tech ... but it's clear that this is a very highly invasive type of technology,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Our society is going to have to decide whether that is acceptable.'' But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Panella </PERSON>'s services are sorely needed. `` How else can you stop the lawyer who stops by his favorite crack house on the way home?'' Hook said. `` I think it's needed because nothing has been done to stop the users.'' There are other businesses like <PERSON> Panella </PERSON>'s around the country, but `` there are n't very many of them, I'm sure,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohrer </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s state and industry section in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> said he had been contacted by someone in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who wanted to start a drug-dog business. <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> is so much in demand now that <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> is training a 4-month-old beagle named <PERSON> Daffy </PERSON> to handle the overflow. But dog owners daydreaming of making a fortune off Fido should know that a good drug dog costs about $ 6,000 to train, and not all types are suited for the work, <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> said. `` The biggest thing about training a drug dog is starting with the right animal. You want the obnoxious, hyper, snotty types,'' he said. `` You want them to get keyed up.'' <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> has a special dispensation from the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to keep the illegal drugs he needs to train his dogs. But the animals never get to eat the drugs that drive them crazy. `` Everybody thinks the dogs are all junkies, but we never let them touch the drugs,'' <PERSON> Panella </PERSON> said. `` I've seen dogs get stoned out, and they're never the same after that.''

It's a delightful hour, for cooks and for eaters. <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON>, whose restaurant features a changing menu of regional American foods, was `` raised in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> grandmother'' and so qualifies as a Southern cook. But she acknowledges at the start that some will disagree with her version of the dishes: `` Every Southerner believes his South is the only true one.'' Her guests come from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Blount </PERSON> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> -RRB-, and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> -RRB-, and have a range of experience in the kitchen. <PERSON> Blount </PERSON>, for instance, mostly puts things in and takes things out of the oven, tastes the food, and comments on it: `` This is the prettiest ham. I've seen little children that were n't as pretty.'' Over cocktails, <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> laugh about fruitcakes and <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blount </PERSON> discuss childhood Christmases, including <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>'s memories of breakfasts of quail and ham with red-eye gravy and grits. When <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> makes his cornbread stuffing, he notes that it's `` not essential to cook these innards until they're quite well-done'' because they'll cook in the turkey But <PERSON> Blount </PERSON> wanders into the kitchen, takes a handful of stuffing and bites into a raw giblet, which <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> calls `` chicken gizzard sashimi.'' At one point, <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> coerces <PERSON> Blount </PERSON> and <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> to pick crab for the snapper stuffing. As they work on a big pile of blue crabs, they giggle and reminisce, and <PERSON> Blount </PERSON>, who steals a few bites and gets caught with crabmeat on the end of his nose, lets on that he's borrowed <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>'s apron `` When I used to try to cook things, people used to say, ` You could n't wear <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>'s apron.' But I showed them,''' he says. When <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> was working with producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolkowitz </PERSON> to plan `` Miss <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s Southern Holiday Dinner,'' it was decided to try to fit the celebrity guests in with the cooking, said <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON>. That's authentic, <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, explaining that her grandmother's generation would make long trips across the prairie `` for house parties that would last six weeks over the holidays. And I think that was in my mind in some way... I had a real vision of these people being in my kitchen.'' The result is comfortable and welcoming, what <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON> calls a `` comedy-cooking-talk'' show. <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> said she worried a little that the food would be overwhelmed by all the commotion, but when serious work is under way in the kitchen, the directions are clear and concise and easy to follow. Viewers also can send for recipes. `` I really think good food is riveting. I do n't think people will wander from that,'' <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> said. `` And we really set it up so that when we were n't making food, we were talking about it. Southerners just love to talk about food, and if they're not talking about food, they're talking about family. And sometimes they're talking about food and family.'' There are dishes for cooks of all abilities. <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> makes her derby pie in less than 5 minutes, and many people will sympathize when she zaps the butter too long in a microwave oven and declares, `` It's spitting at me.'' <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> even admits she does n't make her own crust for her pie of pecans, chocolate chips, eggs and sugar. After filming, the food was donated to a shelter for homeless people. The show is intended as the first of a series on American regional cooking, including future similar holiday specials. <PERSON> Bronz </PERSON> said she is on a `` mission'' to promote American food, announcing at the start: `` It's Miss <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s job to see that great American food goes public.'' Wish her well, for then we all can see more of Miss Ruby.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Marlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> accompanied her husband, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year, she had more in mind than sightseeing in Red Square. The trip gave her the idea for what will be the first Soviet-American co-production of an entertainment show, her special `` Free to Be ... A Family,'' airing Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an entertainment exchange between kids and superstar performers from this country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We present our favorite performers and they present theirs. It's a fun show of comedy and song, but the show also challenges destructive stereotypes about families. `` Our goal is to show children that every family, no matter who's in it or where they live, is a real family as long as its members nurture and love each other `` We also talk about the global family. It's no longer ` we' and ` they,' we have to start thinking of ` us.' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> talks about feeding the entire world with one turkey and how big it was would have to be. <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> sings the song that became our theme, ` Turn of the Tide.' It says we are the turn of the tide and we have to speak up.'' The one-hour special is a sequel to `` Free to Be ... You and Me,'' which won <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> and Emmy awards in 1984. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> made arrangements for the special while her husband was taping a week's worth of his syndicated talk show `` Donahue'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Free to Be ... A Family'' was put together later by means of a satellite hookup between the <LOCATION> Hard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gosteleradio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is host of the special in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedeneyeva </PERSON> is host in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Among the American performers are the rock group <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, actress <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, comic magicians <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> and Teller, singer-songwriter <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, comedians <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and Muppets Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. `` We started work on the special last September,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` It was very complicated to put together. This is the first jointly produced American-Soviet entertainment program. ... We have 40 Soviet kids and 40 American kids, and we sing over the ` space bridge' satellite. The kids were selected a year ago and got to know each other by exchanging letters and photos.'' A `` Free to Be ... A Family'' book was published in 1987, and half a million copies have been sold. An album featuring many of the stars on the special was issued last month. `` Soviet rock star <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Prezhnikof </PERSON> is on the show. I was surprised to learn the Russians dance to the same dance steps we do and know more about us than we know about them. They know all of our rock stars and see our movies.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the first project, `` Free to Be ... You and Me'' was an attempt to rewrite children's literature to eliminate sexual and ethnic stereotypes. `` There were too many stories about Prince Charming coming along and carrying the girl off,'' she said. `` I wanted to liberate the definition of boy and girl the way we had liberated the definition of men and women. The new book liberates the definition of the family and expands its meaning.'' With the special completed, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is now on to other things. She's just completed a comedy-mystery called `` In the Spirit.'' It co-stars <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> plays a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> wife, and I'm a New Age health food store owner who thinks all the world's problems would be solved if people would just stop eating meat,'' she said. `` We're being chased by someone who thinks we know about a murder.'' Next, she will star in a feature film for 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> called `` A Point of Light.'' It's a story of a rural family and probably will be filmed in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. She will also co-star with her father, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, in a CBS drama called `` Deception.'' She said, `` We play father and daughter,'' he said. `` We look alike so what else could we play?''

<HEAD>Holiday Decorations, Use Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The annual crop of holiday greenery is sprouting in American homes. Enjoying those decorations also means using some care to avoid fire and keep children from poisoning themselves accidentally. Some of the most popular plants used for holiday decorations are poisonous, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>. Holly is popular because of its bright green leaves and red berries, but the berries can be dangerous if eaten. Swallowing the berries can lead to diarrhea, vomiting and depression of the central nervous system, the <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> says. Mistletoe berries are another danger, containing chemicals that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, high blood pressure and even collapse of the circulatory system, medical authorities say. In addition, diarrhea, weakness, low blood pressure and other problems can occur from eating any part of the yew plant. Those lovely red poinsettias can be troublesome too. Health officials say that if any part of the plant is swallowed it can cause abdominal discomfort, while the milky sap from the leaves can cause an irritation or dermatitis in some people. Another decoration danger is fire, with Christmas trees and other greenery a major problem. Try to keep the tree as moist as possible, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> urges. After bringing it home cut off a few inches of the base and place it in water. And keep the tree well watered when in use. Buyers should avoid dry trees, of course. A good test is to pull on some needles and see if they resist. The harder they are to pull off, the better. If the cut part of the tree is sticky with resin, that's a good sign. Try bouncing the tree on the ground a bit: a shower of falling needles tells you that it's too dry. When going to bed or leaving the house turn off lights on trees and other decorations, the commission said. And never use candles on trees or near greens. Check all lights for broken bulbs and frayed wires before installing them, and discard any damaged strings. Never use lights on a metallic artificial tree. A faulty string can cause the entire tree to become charged, potentially causing an electrocution. This type of tree can be brightened by a spotlight shining on it. Other safety suggestions from the <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> include: _ Artificial snow sprays can irritate the lungs if inhaled Read the directions carefully and follow them. _ Wear gloves when decorating with spun glass `` angel hair'' to avoid irritation to eyes and skin _ Use plastic `` tinsel'' rather than the leaded kinds which could be hazardous if ingested _ In homes with children be especially careful of using fragile decorations or items with sharp points or which resemble candy or food _ Before lighting any fire make sure trimmings and wrapping paper are clear of the area Do not burn wrappings in the fireplace.

<TEXT>
 The grandson of <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> sat in the room where one of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s assassins killed the old revolutionary with an ax and pondered how far the new, more enlightened <PERSON> Kremlin </PERSON> would go toward making amends. `` If glasnost wants to have authenticity ... it must recognize the proper place of <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'' in history, <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON> said, using the word denoting the more open Soviet policies of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The latest sign of change came Dec. 6, when <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> received permission to visit his half-sister <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, who is dying of cancer in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He has not been to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or seen his sister in 57 years, and learned only last month that she was alive. `` It's all part of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy,'' <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said, and <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> has been emerging slowly from `` the dark cave'' of Soviet history since glasnost began. `` For 50 or 60 years the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> public has been conditioned to think of him as almost the devil,'' his grandson said. `` You ca n't change black to white in one day. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON> in 1879, was among the most popular leaders of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution _ commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, commissar for war and foreign affairs, the right hand of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. After losing a power struggle with <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, he became a `` non-person.'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> exiled him in 1929 and <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s name was stricken from Soviet history. Photographs and film were doctored to erase his image. Real and imagined followers were hunted down, and imprisoned or killed. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s road ended on a summer afternoon in at his desk in the modest house in <LOCATION> Coyoacan </LOCATION>, in those days was a quiet village. <LOCATION> Coyoacan </LOCATION> is enveloped by the smog of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> now, but in the house itself little has change since the assassin entered it Aug. 20, 1940, with a mountaineer's ice ax. It has no plaques, polished display cases or uniformed guards, but there is a caretaker to greet visitors. He answers the bell, shows them through the rooms and hands them the guest book to sign. `` There was a terrible solitude, an emptiness here in the house,'' <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said, remembering the years after the assassination. He was born in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Zina </PERSON> and now is 62, a semi-retired chemical engineer. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s house always has attracted a few Soviet visitors, he said, but more have come in the past year or so. `` They are opening windows in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said. `` They are turning on the light. There is a freshness.'' Glasnost has not altered <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s official status but his name sometimes is mentioned publicly and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rehabilitated a son, <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON>'s step-uncle <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON>, who died in a Stalin purge. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda called <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> an `` enemy of Stalin'' rather than an enemy of `` socialism'' and the revolution. `` I believe that his heroic struggle, almost alone, against one of the most terrible, the bloodiest tyrannies in history is the stage of his life that is going to have the most historical importance,'' <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said. A quiet river that ran behind <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s house two generations ago has become a stream of vehicles belching fumes on a freeway, but in the shadowed rooms, behind thick walls, time seems congealed. `` It's curious. He did n't live here long ... but he impregnated the house with his presence,'' the grandsom said. Beside the reading lamp, the dictaphone waits next to books in French, German, Russian, Spanish and English on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, capitalism, Italian fascism, colonialism, British trade unionism. The bloodstains on <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s chair have faded but bullet holes from an earlier assassination attempt still pock the bedroom walls. He had the windows shuttered with steel and the gateway bricked up after the attack May 24, 1940, by Mexican Stalinists with machine guns. Three months later, a Stalinist agent who had insinuated himself into the <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> circle attacked with the ice ax. When <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON>, then 14, entered the room his grandfather lay on the floor, bleeding, his wife at his side. The assassin spent 20 years in prison but his identity never was confirmed. He was thought to be a Spaniard, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercader </PERSON>, but also was known as <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mornard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> treated each day after the May attack as a bonus: `` Every morning after he got up, he would say ` Another day of life, <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON>. Another day of life.''' <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s second wife, lived in the house for more than 20 years after the assassination. She died in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1962. In the garden, a simple gray stone monument carved with a hammer and sickle encloses the ashes of <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON>. A red flag flutters overhead.

<HEAD>Italian Women Getting Ahead, Say Men Must Catch Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s hottest anchorwoman hikes her skirt on the evening news, gets sozzled on champagne from male admirers and, before signing off, invites men to call her on a special line. It happens in a television spoof of television, written and directed by women, but real life is getting closer. State television has a woman news reader. `` When you feel secure, you can poke fun at yourself,'' said <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandini </PERSON>, one of three authors of the new weekly show `` TiVu Delle Ragazze'' -LRB- The Girls' Television -RRB-. An increasing number of prime time newscasts feature women, and <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> women are becoming prominent in many other fields once closed to them. Women drive <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s orange-colored buses in bumper-to-bumper traffic ever more frequently directed by female traffic officers. Policewomen wave automatic rifles out the windows of squad cars as they escort ministers and dignitaries. Until 1981, the national police force assigned women only to cases involving prostitution or children. Sunday afternoon soccer, that ultimate male bastion, now has a woman as one of the play-by-play radio commentators. The games are not televised live. When the first woman justice was named to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in September, she was asked what it meant to enter a world previously reserved for men. `` It signifies that women are present, that they're doing their job,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON> <PERSON> Luccioli </PERSON> said. She began her judicial career in 1963, when women were permitted to become magistrates. <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhionero </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist who has done studies for the government on the future of women, said the movement into top positions is increasing and remains merely a `` question of time.'' `` Professors at universities ... engineers, businesswomen, architects,'' she enumerated. `` They're not content to stay in civil service jobs. The woman is changing. She has changed. It's the man who has n't changed.'' Women in fields ranging from politics to banking echoed her comment in interviews. They reported tremendous gains at work but much less success in persuading men to help mind the house and children. A survey of city families with both spouses working found the men put in an average of 3-5 hours a week at such chores as home repairs and cleaning the car while women did 33-35 hours of housework. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarantelli </PERSON>, an American who serves in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said changing sex roles are difficult for an Italian man `` whose mother would respond to every whim.'' Newly married Italian men often are dismayed to discover that their wives, working or not, will not iron their underwear like their mothers did. `` The Italian woman's -LRB- struggle -RRB- is especially hard'' because of the importance placed on the family and the concept of the mother as its pillar, Ms. <PERSON> Occhionero </PERSON> said. It often is difficult to run an Italian family, given the structure of Italian society, especially for working mothers. Mrs. <PERSON> Tarantelli </PERSON>, a mother, noted that public schools do n't have team sports or other extracurricular activities. That means babysitters for children who finish classes at 1 p.m., five or six hours before parents finish work. Stores close three hours for lunch and only a few stay open past 8 p.m. In the Tuscan hilltown of <LOCATION> Arezzo </LOCATION>, complaints by factory workers that the only day care center shut down before the factory did prompted the town to open another with more suitable hours. <PERSON> Gioia </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, a cultural anthropologist who founded a hotline for abused women, said a survey she did of 700 teen-agers in an <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> resort town indicated girls see no limits on possible achievement but boys are confused about their changing roles. Ms. <PERSON> Occhionero </PERSON> said stereotypical Latin males `` are afraid of these women. They want to protect them but do n't understand to what point, -LRB- and -RRB- they are threatened.'' <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappanico </PERSON>, a journalist in her 20s, says many women do n't help their cause. `` Italian women are still different from northern European or <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Zappanico </PERSON>, who has spent time in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They're not mentally independent. Even women who work think they have to depend on men. They do n't value independence that much in itself.'' In a nationwide study of women's lot in the 1870s, the first years of a unified <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, an official in <ORGANIZATION> Bari </ORGANIZATION> said `` an ass, an ox, a sheep are always worth more than a wife to the peasant, and the wife obeys her husband like a slave.'' A simple rendezvous could get a wife convicted of adultery a brief generation ago but a husband could be prosecuted only if he brought his lover to live in the house. A 1969 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision led to adultery being abolished as a crime for either sex. Birth control pills were legalized in the early 1970s and abortion in 1978. Children of an Italian man who marries a foreigner always have qualified for citizenship automatically, but those of a woman in the same situation did not qualify until 1984. Dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> thought a woman's place was home making babies, but some historians feel his policy of getting women out of the workplace helped them in the long run because many enrolled in universities when they could not get jobs. As more and more Italian women enter politics, their issues are certain to get more attention. Ms. <PERSON> Occhionero </PERSON> said women are `` ever more present'' in the field but still scarce `` in proportion to their effort.''

The welcome ends if owners think the restaurant is becoming a stopgap shelter for smelly transients. `` Sometimes it's difficult to put people out because you know they have no place to go,'' said night manager <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. `` But you ca n't have vagrants. It scares the normal customers. `` Some come in for five or 10 minutes just to get warm and wo n't buy anything Some end up sitting there with the same thing for an hour. I ask them to leave. I ca n't have my boss see the whole place full of vagrants,'' he said. A week ago, a homeless alcoholic man was dragged from a fast food eatery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and deposited on the sidewalk after passing out over his meal. He lay there five hours before anyone noticed he was dead. Homeless advocates decried the incident as a too-common example of society's callousness. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> episode highlights the predicament of fast-food restaurants, which have become beacons for the homeless. They do n't want to banish people to the streets, but neither do they want their family atmosphere disrupted by shabby creatures, sometimes lugging all their worldly possessions in shopping bags and carts Some places deal with the problem by posting time limits. The Burger King on Eighth Avenue allows no customer to linger longer than 20 minutes. `` It's fast food. We need the seating space,'' said manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` But if someone passed out inside, I would call an ambulance. You just ca n't carry them out to the street, especially if they had made a purchase.'' Other places make case-by-case decisions. `` If they smell and bother other customers, we tell them to leave,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Choe </PERSON>, who runs a McDonald's on Canal Street in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` We do n't set a limit on how much money or how much time they spend, as long as nobody is offended,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, manager of a McDonald's near Grand Central Station. `` If someone in a suit and tie is being a real pain, we would escort them out.'' Advocates say thousands of homeless seek refuge in subway cars, train stations, bus depots or burger joints. `` There are parts of the country I've been in where the local <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> is an emergency shelter by default,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, founder of the city's Coalition for the Homeless. `` As night follows day, a human being afflicted by a cold wind is going to look for refuge,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` But nobody with a reasonable option is going to sleep in a McDonald's. If there were reasonable alternatives, this problem would disappear.'' An estimated 30,000 to 45,000 people stay in abandoned buildings or public places nightly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, not counting the ones sleeping in shelters, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. An October survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> found 1,404 homeless living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subways. Nationwide, no accurate census exists, but an estimated 3 million people are without homes, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. It agrees that restaurants make lousy sleeping quarters. `` These places are not designed to function as housing,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the coalition. `` But there is no place else to go.''

 It was a dismal day, wet and cold and gray _ the things most hateful about December. A few potatoes were rotting and their smell was vile, but <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> did n't seem to mind. Tramping across a muck-filled yard in his rubber boots, the 42-year-old potato farmer showed a visitor around with typical Irish generosity of time and spirit. Highlights of the tour of J and <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheridan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s biggest potato farms, included a new bagging machine and storehouses full of those humblest of tubers, whose irregular shapes and skins of homespun brown inspire instant affection `` We are putting our potatoes in much more attractive packaging,'' said <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, who is spending about 630,000 Irish pounds -LRB- nearly $ 1 million -RRB- to modernize the farm. `` The emphasis all the time, every single day, is better quality. I am ensuring that my market will be there.'' Welcome to the brave new world of the Irish potato industry, launching the praties of legend into the 21st century. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s potato farmers, who have a most colorful past, are fighting for a future dimmed by imports and a drop in demand. In the 19th century, potatoes were the staple food of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and blight caused a cruel famine. Lately, the Irish have strayed to such exotic foods as pasta and farmers are trying to woo them back by, among other things, developing better-looking potatoes. What is a good-looking potato? `` What's a good-looking man?'' responded <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Wilkinstown </LOCATION>. `` Very subjective,'' he concluded. The ideal spud is said to be large, well-rounded and shallow-eyed. Presentation matters, too. Farmers are packaging their products better, offering consumers cleaner potatoes in smaller quantities and more uniform sizes. They are investing in better machinery and storage facilities, breeding higher-yield varieties that are more resistant to disease and will deliver larger crops per acre. They now export, to counter imports from other Common Market countries, and support development of a potato processing industry. Experts say the effort is paying off. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> said a long decline in output is stabilizing. The total was 400,000 tons last year and is expected to be about 370,000 for 1988, he said. Imports are expected to be 30,000 tons this year and exports 13,400. A ton of potatoes brings about 90 pounds -LRB- $ 140 -RRB-. `` I'd say we're more competitive,'' <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> said. Potatoes have been grown in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for more than 350 years and are woven into its culture and history. They have inspired poems and songs. They conjure many images, warm as Irish stew or wrenching as famine and emigration. `` So great has been its influence that the potato and the Irishman are often considered as somewhat synonymous,'' potato expert <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> wrote. Spaniards brought potatoes to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in the 16th century. English explorer Sir <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Raleigh </PERSON> usually gets the credit for introducing them to the Emerald Isle. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was the first European country to grow potatoes on a large scale. By the early 1840s they were the main food for one-third of its 8 million people. Planting reached a peak of 2.5 million acres in 1845 but blight destroyed the crop and caused the Great Famine of 1845-1849, a catastrophe that killed an estimated 1 million people and caused another million to leave. Emigration continues and the birth rate is declining, so <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s population now is but 3.4 million and potato acreage is a mere 75,000. Commercial growers, once tens of thousands, number only 6,000. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> potato dealer, said <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s entry into the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 `` has created competition, and a lot of people were not ready to cope.'' `` People are now eating things which are considered alien to the Irish character, such as pasta and rice,'' he said. Use of potatoes for industrial alcohol and animal feed has declined. With more women working and incomes growing, fewer potatoes are peeled and cooked at home. Per capita consumption fell to 244 pounds in 1984 from 260 pounds in 1980, but still is nearly double that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> surveyed the farm where he first planted 12 acres of potatoes in 1967 and today grows 250 acres of <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Pink </PERSON>, the Irish favorite. `` We are managing to meeting the challenge,'' he said. `` We believe we'll be in business another 20 years.''

<TEXT>
 On his suddenly shortened visit, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> achieved every out-of-towner's dream of making it big in the Big Apple. He saw his name in lights on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. As his 45-car motorcade moved through Times Square at the height of rush hour, one of those huge news headline display signs flashed `` Welcome, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' The chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet got the friendly message. At the corner of 5lst and Broadway, the tank-like Zil limousine came to a halt, a smiling <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stepped out and began pressing the flesh as the crowd chanted `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' His startled security detail, led by bomb squad vans and a legion of motorcycles, executed an illegal U-turn that further confounded cross-town traffic already immobilized by `` Gorby-lock.'' Here are other scenes from a reporter's notebook on the brief visit of the statesman-tourist from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: _ Something like 180,000 commuters heeded Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s warning against coming to town during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit. The number of vehicles entering <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> by bridge and tunnel dropped 20 percent, bringing about a new Christmas miracle on 34th Street in the vicinity of <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> department store, where a police inspector observed that traffic was `` no more chaotic than normal.'' The motorcade's l6-minute dash from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to South Ferry was the envy of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> taxi drivers and should qualify as a modern record in daylight hours. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s traffic commissars were serious. They even posted parking meters with signs in Russian: `` Do n't Even Think of Parking.'' _ When the curtains were drawn, the squat, highly polished, somewhat antiquated Soviet black limousines flown in with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> looked as if they had strayed off course from a Mafia funeral along Mulberry Street. Cabbies, however, had high praise for the Russians behind the wheel. `` Being wheel man in a motorcade is real tsuriss,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Moishe </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, using the Yiddish word for tension and trouble. `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>'s visit buried the old joke we had around the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> about a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> motorcade being a 10-car pile-up with flags.'' _ On the `` Tonight Show'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> had a topical gag about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promised half-million cut in Soviet troop strength: `` Soon the Russians will be down to just one obsolete tank, driven by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' _ Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Garwin </PERSON> estimated he had made `` 6,400 crossings'' on the five-minute Governors Island ferry run before being grabbed by news anchors <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> for prime-time interviews. And with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aboard, this was the first time police frog men in their wet suits had inspected the hull of the ferry <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursen </PERSON> minutes before lines were cast off. _ Two <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> cops amused the crowd outside the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> by harmonizing on `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>,'' to the tune of `` Some Enchanted Evening,'' while waiting for the motorcade to roll by the cathedral of capitalism. _ <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the style-conscious Soviet first lady who calls designer <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON> by his first name of <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON>, helped bury the cartoon caricature of frumpy <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women in galoshes and babushkas. In a visit to <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>'s Fifth Avenue beauty salon, she was sprayed with a fragrance called `` White Linen'' by the cosmetic queen herself, who plans to open a branch soon on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Gorky Street. <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> also made a brief stop outside <ORGANIZATION> Bloomigdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, the upscale market version of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Gum department store, but did n't have time to flash her American Express card According to rumors spread by refuseniks, she never leaves her dacha without it. Some Christmas shoppers like <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ozone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, thought they detected the `` look of longing in her eyes that we women get when afflicted with that shop-until-you drop syndrome.'' Or maybe it was the look a Muscovite gets when peering into the windows of a <LOCATION> Beryozka </LOCATION> shop, where luxury goods can be bought only with foreign currency. _ Nearly 60 students protesting on behalf of Soviet Jews were arrested on the final night of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, but the number of demonstrators fell far below what police had anticipated. Among a variety of ethnic and political dissenters was a small group of animals lovers fuming against <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>'s broadtail Persian taupe topcoat and Russian lynx fur hat with signs proclaiming `` minx stinx.'' _ The visit, of course, was a media carnival. One of the more ingenious sideshows featured a Canadian actor, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> look-alike, who conned super capitalist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> into a hoax interview after the real Soviet leader had turned down an invitation to visit his $ 19 million apartment in Trump Tower. _ A yogurt emporium in the alley behind the stock exchange dressed up its luncheon menu with a message in the Cyrillic alphabet. Translated it read: `` Have a nice glasnost.'' _ With <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gazing meaningfully at the Statue of Liberty from <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Governors </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> had its most memorable historical happening since <PERSON> Wouter </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Twiller </PERSON>, the second Dutch governor of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, purchased the 173-acre tract from local Indians for two axe heads and a fistful of nails and named it <LOCATION> Nutten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. On a sparkling day, the tiny island with its sudden promise of long sought world peace almost seemed the inspiration for the closing paragraphs of <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>'s `` The Great Gatsby'': `` The old island that flowered once for Dutch sailor's eyes _ a fresh, green breast of the New World. Its vanished trees had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams. For a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.'' Around the Big Apple, the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION> made a substantive contribution to man's capacity for wonder.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s peacemaking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> visit and the opening of a glitzy Soviet trade show underscored the importance the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader attaches to developing business and commercial ties in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. But perhaps unknown to many Westerners, the Communist superpower has long been dabbling in overseas ventures that range from currency speculation in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to fish canning in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may reduce the Soviet military, as he pledged in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, experts on the Soviet bloc said they believe his broader reforms likely will make the Soviets much more aggressive in foreign investing, exporting and competing for customers in an increasingly global economy. `` They're beginning to talk about more direct investment abroad, focused on firms that might help them market their own products,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, a Soviet economics expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research organization. `` I would n't be at all surprised if they come in and buy out some small European or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms in the next few years.'' The Soviets have not acquired any significant Western companies yet, but the number of foreign firms owned wholly or partly by the Soviets has risen sharply from about a dozen in the early 1960s to more than 120 now, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a Soviet expert at <ORGANIZATION> Carleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, who has compiled a list of Soviet bloc-owned companies in the West for the past 10 years, said many of these ventures reflect a growing sophistication about investing abroad. `` There are different ways in which they do it,'' he said. `` They have assets, portfolios and direct investments. They're in a wide range of business areas: banks, insurance, engineering, shipping and commercial companies.'' The Soviet investment presence abroad remains minuscule by Western standards, however, considering that just one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Japanese conglomerate might have 120 foreign subsidiaries. Still, the Soviets appear to be catching on. `` As they participate in the world economy, they've found this is the way everybody else plays the game,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, for example, the Soviets have established a chain of government-owned service stations to sell one of their biggest exports, petroleum. On this side of the world, the Soviets have stakes in two North American fishing and fish-processing concerns, <ORGANIZATION> Cansov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> As one of the largest producers of agricultural machinery and equipment, the Soviets have long been in the business of selling tractors. In 1972, they formed <ORGANIZATION> Belarus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based marketer of Soviet farm vehicles. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch was formed five years later, with offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. `` I would say this sort of trend will continue, and under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> it will be more dynamic,'' said <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>. `` I do n't think ` The Russians Are Coming' thing really fits. They've been around for awhile.'' The Soviets also are veteran participants in the world's speculative foreign-exchange markets, trading largely through two government-owned banks, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norodny </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Eurobank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Each is believed to have about $ 5 billion in assets. Because the ruble is not a convertible currency, the Soviets must use Western money in order to pay for goods imported from non-communist trading parters. As with other currency speculators, the Soviets like to move their holdings into the currency that is worth the most at any given time. They are said to favor the Swiss franc, although they also have deposits and trading accounts denominated in dollars, British pounds, West German marks and Japanese yen. `` They used to be into wild speculation, but they're more careful now,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>, a Soviet expert at <ORGANIZATION> Planecon </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based consulting and information concern that studies the centrally planned economies of the Soviet bloc. A few years ago, for example, Soviet traders attempted to push down the value of the Swiss franc by dumping $ 50 million worth of francs in 20 separate orders throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, assuming dealers would not be able to communicate fast enough about who was selling. The Soviets were wrong, losing money and respect. `` It really caused a lot of bad blood,'' <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON> said. `` You do this to someone in the foreign-exchange market, and the next time they deal with you they're extra careful.'' Some traders have privately accused the Soviets of eavesdropping on international telephone lines for advance word on central bank coordination and intervention, which often moves a currency sharply. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Norodny bank, for example, is believed to have once made huge profits on marks it bought just before the mark soared in value after the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> made a surprise policy shift. That change resulted from a telephone conversation hours earlier between aides from the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and according to one widely circulated story the Soviets learned about it through a wiretap. On the other hand, the Soviets can show remarkable naivete about economic trends that hurt their currency holdings. They were active buyers of dollars just before the currency tumbled because of a coordination agreement by the leading Western democracies and the collapse of oil prices a few years ago. `` Generally they are savvy in the short run, but they do n't do too well in the long run,'' said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. `` They are miserable in making forecasts. They do n't have the trained people, the information, and keep making judgments based on their own behavior.''

 Business Week's former broadcast editor, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON>, has pleaded guilty to mail fraud in an insider trading scheme, admitting he illegally used advance material from the magazine to buy and sell securities. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> admitted on Thursday making $ 15,000 between January 1986 and last July in securities trades, using not-yet-published information from upcoming issues of the nation's biggest business weekly. The 62-year-old editor waived indictment and pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who released him on $ 100,000 bond. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for March 8, 1989. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines on each count. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON>, who had broadcast market and business news for Business Week since 1981, was fired Aug. 12 for failing to disclose all his stock trades and the full extent of his holdings, in violation of the magazine's ethics code. The first criminal charges were filed in the widening scandal last August. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, a stock broker who had been fired by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for suspcious trades was charged with mail fraud. Seven employees of <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION>'s printer also lost their jobs, a result of an in-house investigation that allegedly found workers sold advance copies of Business Week. Two brokers at two other investment firms also were fired. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> did not report, write or edit stories for Business Week. But he broadcast a business news report several times a day from the magazine's office in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to radio stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. According to the charges, <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> used information obtained largely from Business Week's market-sensitive `` Inside Wall Street'' column to buy and sell securities on 50 occasions. `` A security that received a favorable mention in that column generally increased in price in the period immediately following public dissemination of Business Week,'' court papers said. In entering his plea, <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> said he probably lost more money than he made in his securities trading. According to the charges, <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> regularly received a page proof of the `` Inside Wall Street'' column on Thursdays _ hours before its official release to the public _ to make sure companies mentioned in the column were not referred to in radio broadcasts. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> also was free to use the information in his weekend reports, which were taped on Fridays. Instead, <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> bought shares or options to buy shares, and caused unidentified `` other persons'' to purchase securities in companies receiving favorable mention in the upcoming column. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> refused to characterize who the `` other persons'' were but said the investigation was continuing. He also commended Business Week and its publisher, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for their cooperation. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> conducted transactions in the securities of such companies as Champion Spark Plug, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> was charged with mail fraud for victimizing the magazine, which is delivered by mail <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> was not charged with securities fraud for insider trading, the prosecutor said, because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> split 4-4 on that issue last year in the case of former <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the mail and wire fraud convictions of <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> for using advance knowledge of upcoming Journal columns to make illegal trading profits. But the court split over a broad interpretation of `` misappropriation'' of confidential information that would have included revealing yet-to-be published newspaper and magazine stories. Noting that the penalty for mail fraud and securities fraud were the same, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said `` from a criminal -LRB- law -RRB- point of view, this is a safer way to achieve the same results.''

 A former president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been accused of leaking highly secret <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> interest rate figures to a now-bankrupt brokerage firm seeking a jump on the securities market. An indictment returned here Thursday charged <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Rough with insider trading while a member of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s regional network, from 1982 to 1984. Rough, 49, of <LOCATION> Layton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, received $ 47,000 in interest-deferred loans from the now-defunct <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bresler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> investment firm in exchange for the information, the indictment charged. Rough is accused of relaying the data by telephone from his executive suite at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> and once from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s boardroom just after a meeting, prosecutors told a news conference. <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> made millions of dollars in government securities trades based on Rough's advance word about decisions made by the national <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on the discount rate and on recommendations made by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> about the discount rate, the indictment said. Changes in the discount rate, the interest charged by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on loans to banks, can have a strong impact on financial markets. Rough's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON>, would not comment in detail but said: `` Mr. Rough is going to enter a plea of not guilty and vigorously contest the charges.'' Rough's home telephone number is unlisted and he could not be reached for comment. He resigned earlier this year as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Branchville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is one of 12 regional banks in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, all of which make recommendations every two weeks on whether the discount rate should be changed. The national <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has the final say in setting the rate. Word that discount rate information was leaked surfaced in April 1987 during a trial stemming from the collapse of <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON>, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its rules on disclosing the discount rate. The allegations came to light during the trial of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON>'s president, on charges stemming from the $ 144 million collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION>, N.J.-based firm in April 1985. Three other principals who pleaded guilty in the firm's collapse in exchange for their cooperation testified about Rough's allegedly passing on the <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, a long-time friend of Rough's, is serving an 8-year sentence for securities violations. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> testified that Rough approached him for the $ 47,000 in loans to buy a chunk of stock in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION>. Rough faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Rough was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire fraud and securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks. No arraignment date has been set. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rough </PERSON> violated a position of `` great power, trust and responsibility,'' and hoped the case would serve as a warning to other would-be insider-traders of interest rate data. `` He abused that office in a very shocking and outrageous manner,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials have called the discount rate one of their most closely guarded secrets. The rate is widely regarded as an indicator of the direction in which the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to push interest rates, which affect the prices of bonds. Federal authorities were told by <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> principals of the allegations against Rough during interviews shortly after the firm's collapse. After the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> learned of them, it stopped telling regional federal reserves of its decision on the discount rate earlier in the day than when it was announced publicly, said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakstansky </PERSON>. The indictment took so long because of the complex process of examining <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON>'s brokerage operations, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. He said the case was the first insider-trading scheme involving the discount rate, and the first against a sitting member of a federal reserve bank. Rough sat on the board as a representative of small banks in the regional <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s district.

 The prime time is at hand for a special brand of holiday shopping that has become a tradition of sorts on Wall Street. Stock analysts and traders are busily combing the markets for issues trading at or near their lowest levels of the year. The idea is to buy these stocks while they are artificially depressed by yearend sell orders _ from individual investors looking for tax writeoffs and from institutions clearing the losers out of their portfolios before they make yearend reports to clients. Once the pressure of this selling is removed with the arrival of the new year, the reasoning goes, these stocks stand a good chance of rebounding, even if the financial affairs of the companies involved do n't change much. In his annual Stock Trader's Almanac, investment adviser <PERSON> Yale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> describes the list of stocks trading at new 52-week lows around Dec. 15 as a menu for `` the only free lunch on Wall Street.'' For most of the time in the past 15 years, according to <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s research, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> issues at new lows on Dec. 15 outperformed the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index through the following Feb. 15 Last winter, for example, the 23 new lows posted an aggregate gain of 13.2 percent over the two-month period, compared to a 6.8 percent rise for the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index. Occasionally, however, the `` free lunch'' is more famine than feast. The four new lows at mid-December 1985, which included three energy-related issues, suffered an overall loss of 22.5 percent by the next Feb. 15 as oil prices nosedived. In addition, small investors armed with limited capital face problems turning this historical trend into a workable trading strategy. Brokerage commissions take their considerable toll. And if a trader does n't have enough money to buy a diversified package of the stocks at new lows, which ones to pick? The December bargain hunt does dovetail nicely with a phenomenon known as the `` January effect'' that has been widely analyzed in academic studies and at least one book. This research has documented a tendency for stocks, especially those of smaller companies, to show unusual strength in the first few weeks of the year. The only trouble with the January effect, analysts say, is the very recognition it has received. Once market patterns become well known, they often quickly change as traders try to capitalize on them. Thus the suspicion among a good many Wall Streeters that the January effect will soon be negated, or at least moved into December. Whether or not they prove to be `` bargains,'' many of the lists of depressed stocks being published these days contain a surprising number of big names. For example, at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> ran a computer screen of stocks with market values of at least $ 50 million, priced at no more than 10 percent above their 52-week lows, and carrying price-earnings multiples of no more than 10. The names that turned up included <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> and several technology issues that once ranked as leading glamour stocks. Blue-chip industrial companies? How about <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Weyerhaueser </PERSON>, for starters. `` No investment decision is warranted on the basis of these figures alone,'' <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> cautioned. For a further observation, they added: `` It is interesting to note how many stocks are still down sharply'' in the aftermath of the October 1987 crash.

<HEAD>Say Another Drexel Trader Turns State's Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bond trader has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors probing the Wall Street firm for possible securities fraud, the second employee to turn state's evidence this week. Sources familiar with the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case, who spoke on condition they not be identified, confirmed a report Friday that <PERSON> Terren </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON>, who worked on the bond trading desk at the firm's <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> office, agreed late Wednesday to provide evidence in exchange for immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON> sat near <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond financier and a key target of the federal investigation that has lasted more than two years, an outgrowth of the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and two other employees have been accused by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of conspiring with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to commit frauds that range from trading on inside information to stock manipulation. Now imprisoned, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has been the government's key source of evidence in the case. A <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal grand jury has been investigating the firm on similar grounds and has been expected to indict <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and the others for months. The defendants have maintained their innocence, although <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has been negotiating with prosecutors about a possible settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON>'s cooperation reflected a tougher negotiating stance by the government and intensified pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to capitulate in order to avoid a possibly devastating indictment that would include charges of racketeering, which carry enormous fines. But it was unclear what, if any, incriminating material <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON> could provide. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> declined to comment on the development. Aides to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> also declined to comment in accordance with their policy of silence on pending investigations. <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON>'s agreement came one day after another key figure in the investigation, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Maultasch </PERSON>, struck a plea bargain with prosecutors. But the effect of <PERSON> Maultasch </PERSON>'s cooperation also remains unclear.

 The stock market was mixed today amid what analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and selling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.56 to 2,145.27 in the first half hour of trading. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 411 up, 452 down and 596 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 20.80 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings before they make yearend reports to clients. At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes. Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to discern any trends in the making for stock prices. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 46 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> dropped \ to 46, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- at 29 | <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -RRB- to 4 | in the over-the-counter market The company said the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> asked for more proof of the safety and effectiveness of its Therfectin antiarthritis drug before the product is submitted for approval. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .22 to 155.59. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down .10 at 297.28. On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen 61.35 points in the week's first three trading days, dropped back 11.92 to 2,141.71. Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 491 up, 934 down and 541 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 124.15 million shares, down from 148.36 million in the previous session.

 <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to shift $ 1.1 billion from a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> subsidiary to its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations and take a $ 150 million tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings.

He said $ 750 million would be repatriated immediately and $ 350 million at a later date. The company said it is taking the charge against earnings because it had not set aside money to pay taxes on the additional income. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said returning the foreign earnings to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give the company greater flexibility He said the move also would allow <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> to use certain foreign tax credits that expire at year's end.

The Appellate Division of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday affirmed a decision that the merger violated a 1984 agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and its largest stockholder, <ORGANIZATION> Christ-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a broadcasting and manufacturing company. At issue in the case are <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s televison stations. Chris-Craft claimed in a suit filed in July that because <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> owned six stations, the merger violated a 4-year-old pact prohibiting <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from owning any TV station so long as it owned 25 percent or more of Chris-Craft's <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> acquired a 42.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 in exchange for <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> - Craft getting 23 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s voting stock The appeals court upheld a a ruling that said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> could not acquire any <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> stock until the TV stations were sold or it reduced its stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said it was moving ahead despite the setback. `` We have been working on alternatives and it is our intent to consummate the transaction in January,'' the company said in a statement. Since the Chris-Craft suit was filed, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> completed the sale of television stations in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to a partnership that includes a former <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> executive. It also reached an agreement in principle to sell a fourth station in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but two independent stations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> remain on the auction block. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> contends the proposed merger would not violate the agreement with Chris-Craft because <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> planned to set up an independent trust, pending approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to run the remaining stations.

<HEAD>EEC Steel Production Will Steady In First Quarter Of 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> predicted Friday that crude steel production in the 12-nation trade bloc would hold steady at about 34 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1989. The prediction matched production estimates for this year's fourth quarter and first quarter The commission also said total production for 1988 should amount to 135 million tons, up 8 percent from 1987. It said demand should remain firm at least through the first quarter of 1989 and possibly through the first half, despite concern over a build-up of stocks in some sectors and diminishing demand from French and West German automobile industries. Export and import prices were rising, while export demand remained high, the commission said. Consumption in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> was expected to remain roughly steady at 29.6 million tons in the first quarter of 1989. That compares with an estimated 29.8 million tons in the fourth quarter of 1988 and 28.24 million tons in the first quarter of 1988.

<HEAD>EEC Official Says Hormone Ban Will Go Into Effect</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Trade Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that a ban on the imports of hormone-treated meat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will go into effect next month. The ban, implementation of which was postponed for one year at the request of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, could provoke a trade war with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> also said the 12-nation EEC only would agree to international arbitration of the dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if consumer-related arguments as well as scientific ones are taken into account. The ban legislated by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, which goes into effect Jan. 1, would affect $ 170 million of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat exports. This does not include about $ 72 million of horsemeat, which is not treated with hormones. EEC and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators were expected to have an opportunity to discuss possible solutions to the dispute when they met here this week for a ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But a U.S.-EEC clash over support for farmers prevented the discussion from taking place. The matter will also not be taken up at a bilateral meeting of ministers taking place in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Friday because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> agriculture negotiators had to stay in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> longer than expected and did not get to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> in time. `` We do n't care what the Americans want for their consumers,'' said <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>. `` Our legislation goes into effect and we will apply it.'' A <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> investigation of reports that European farmers violate the legislation and treat their animals with hormones will not affect implementation of the ban, he said. The council of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees implementation of the 1947 treaty regulating world trade, is scheduled to meet Dec. 20 to consider a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for establishing an arbitration pnel. <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would only accept the arbitration panel if it `` does n't rely just on scientific arguments but also on consumer-related and other arguments.'' He said most <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members already had legislated bans on hormone-treated meat, `` and they think it's good for their consumers.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insists that hormones used on animals do not leave residues that are harmful to humans. Some European scientists have concurred, while others have argued that the hormones can cause cancer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could retaliate against the meat ban with one of its own against European meat exports, which consist mostly of high quality items like Danish ham.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> declared himself satisfied with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role in internatonal trade talks here and said he would reject a petition by American farmers to demand access to the Japanese rice market. But a spokesman for the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>, said Friday that `` the Japanese did n't say one word the entire week about agriculture.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had told reporters that the Japanese delegation to the ministeral meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade `` performed superbly.'' `` They handled themselves skillfully,'' he added. `` It was a first class performance.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's largest net importer of agricultural products, sat in on six days of talks between the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the world's leading farm exporters. `` I did n't hear the translators translate one word from Japanese into agriculture,'' <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> told reporters. The divergence of views reflected attempts by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to curry <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s favor in their battle over agricultural subsidies. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, asked whether he would accept a petition by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, responded, `` I will not.'' Several weeks ago <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> rejected a petition by the American rice producers' group which called on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to investigate whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is employing unfair trade practices in refusing to open its rice market to imports. In turning down the petition, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he hoped the rice question would be resolved in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and if not the farmers could resubmit their appeal. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, concerned with the veiled threat of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, sent a delegation to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to make sure the foreign ministry negotiators did not cave in to demands on the rice issue. But much to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relief, the subject was virtually not mentioned during the six days of talks, which were dominated by the U.S.-EEC clash on farm supports. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking farm subsidy elimination, while the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is only willing to cut down the supports. The talks ended in stalemate. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it did not take sides in the clash. `` Our position is that there is no point in making decisions until they settle,'' said <PERSON> Mutsuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s director of foreign press relations. <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON> said that whatever the outcome, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prime concern is the protection of its rice market against foreign imports. The administration appears content to allow the rice issue to rest as long as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> leaves it on the table for future negotiations. Japanese rice is about four times more expensive than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is insistent on complete self-reliance in production of the staple crop. The Rice Millers were demanding a quota of up to 2.5 percent of the Japanese market the first year, which would rise to 10 percent in the fourth year.

<TEXT>
 Two men have been charged with attempted extortion in a series of death threat letters sent to prominent <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> citizens. Although the two unemployed aerospace workers are suspected of sending 265 computer-printed threats, they were charged with only 10 specific acts to simplify the case, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Many of the letters were identical,'' said <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON>, but he noted that the text of each letter was `` customized'' to include personal information about the intended victims. Roman <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Makuch </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathew </PERSON> <PERSON> Faroni </PERSON>, 26, were arrested in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on Thanksgiving Day and waived extradition. Letters attached to the complaint began with an obscenity and a death threat. The writers then demanded specific amounts of cash as high as $ 600,000 with instructions for its delivery. They also gave gruesome details of how victims would be killed, and threatened harm to children, spouses and relatives of the letter recipients, <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said. Those targeted by the letter writers, he said, were all `` substantial people'' including a former city manager of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, lawyers, bank vice presidents, doctors, dentists, accountants and real estate agents. None of them paid any money, he said. The letters, received Nov. 2-3, told some recipients to take a citizens band radio to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and tune in a specific channel for instructions on where to deliver money. <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said a search of a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> apartment occupied by <PERSON> Makuch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faroni </PERSON> and a nearby storage facility turned up computer, printers and computer discs, a handgun and several CB radios. He said acquaintances said about the pair: `` They could be characterized as being a couple of oddballs, misfits.'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> added, `` there is some indication there may be other people involved.'' <PERSON> Makuch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faroni </PERSON> were unemployed but had worked previously on the assembly line at <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> plant on the B-1B bomber project, <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion, attempted extortion and sending threatening letters for extortion purposes. If convicted, <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said they could draw maximum sentences of six years in prison.

<HEAD>The Year It Didn't Happen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the next few weeks the media will attempt to wrap up the economic year, and one of their themes is likely to be that 1988 was the year when it did n't happen. So much did n't happen that was expected to happen _ a secondary shock wave in the stock market and a recession, for instance _ that it carries a message for 1989. That message: Do n't place too much faith in the seers, because they really do n't put all that faith in themselves. Many of the stock market doomsayers, for example, reversed themselves last summer and put their bets on stocks. Another school of economic sages based their forecast of recession on the assumption that an expansion that had already gone on for five years would have to stop for breath. Instead, the expansion merely slowed and inhaled. Now, one year later, these seers are expressing the identical doubts they had in 1987, and for the very same reasons. It is a no-lose situation, because a recession that does n't come can be explained away as unexpectedly good news. And eventually, if not now, they will be right; they'll let you know about it. Interest rates rose, but they did n't go through the roof. Prices did n't run away. Housing did n't collapse. Cars had a good year. The jobless rate continued to fall. Contrary to many forecasts, the trade and budget deficits narrowed, too. The fact that these dire forecasts did n't materialize does n't mean it was a dull year It was n't a dull year, but the things that made it exciting and unusual had very little to do with the foresight of the seers. Do you recall any of them telling you that corporate takeovers would reach such a frantic pace? Did anyone even conceive of a company the size of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> being auctioned off? It is therefore wise in reviewing the forecasts to remember that much of it is a game; when you win you get up on the roof and shout and demonstrate, and when you're wrong you remain in your study and guard your quiet dignity. Nothing can stop the forecasts; they'll be made, if only for publicity purposes. The future, oddly, is an attractive place, largely because it is the great unknown. Though it is a dark mystery, the future is where much of the investment community seeks to reside. You make money by anticipating, by getting in on things early, by beating others, by buying before the news gets around. And so there will be forecasts. Stock market seers make them to impress customers. Scholars sometimes make them because of conviction, or probably to sell books. Market letter writers make them because forecasts excite interest. But evidence that very few people really can foresee the future, at least with any tiny degree of consistency, lies in the consensus forecast, about which you will be reading plenty. The consensus forecast is the median forecast. It is the middle range between extremes. The consensus is often right on the mark, correctly estimating such items as inflation, interest rates and gross national product. And when the consensus is on the mark it means, by definition, that most of the forecasts it is made of are not on the mark.

 Share prices finished lower on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Stock Exchange Friday, but above their worst levels, lifted by a strong trend on Wall Street and the start of a new trading account. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 7.6 points, or 0.4 percent, lower at 1,750.3, well above the day's low of 20 points off. However the market never recovered to its best level of 3.6 points up. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index closed 7.7 points lower at 1,429.4. Volume was a moderate 637.1 million shares up from 543.8 million shares a day earlier. Dealers said the market remained preoccupied through most of the trading session by the prospects for higher interest rates worldwide, focusing on Friday on unconfirmed rumors that West German interest rates may be increased next week. The interest rate worries about <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> added to the market's longstanding concern about the effect on British corporate profitability of recent British base lending rate increases But toward the close, a strong trend on Wall Street, and the 3:30 p.m. start of a new trading account lifted the market from its lows toward the close. The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week periods for accounting purposes. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 6.24 points to 981.56 at the close.

<HEAD>Spain Approves Railway System Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Friday adopted <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s standard width for railroad tracks, a step that will allow trains to roll directly into western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time since track was laid 133 years ago. The move clears the way for completion of high-speed train links with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1992, when <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> hosts the Summer Olympics and celebrates the 500th anniversary of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>' discovery of the New World. The government next week is expected to award a major contract to build <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s first high-speed train system. French, West German and Japanese firms are bidding for the deal. The first phase of the changeover to the narrower European tracks would permit construction of a high-speed line from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bou </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>. By the turn of the century, the 5.5-foot-wide Spanish and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> tracks would be replaced with 4.7-foot-wide track used in 10 other European Economic Community nations. Transport Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> France-to-Seville </LOCATION> line should be ready by the opening of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'s World Expo in spring 1992 to commemorate the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> anniversary and the 1992 <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> Summer Olympics. The government also ordered the state rail company, <ORGANIZATION> RENFE </ORGANIZATION>, to study replacing the rest of the country's 7,887 miles of rail track by 2001. It is widely believed that <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> railways were given a narrower gauge than the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when first built in 1855 to make a military invasion of the <LOCATION> Iberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> more difficult. Engineers maintained that a wider gauge was necessary to accommodate locomotives that carried trains across <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s mountainous terrain Now, wheels on railway cars from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> must be changed or modified at the <LOCATION> Spanish-French </LOCATION> border.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Friday that `` we're right'' in opposing the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s planned ban on hormone-treated meat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters the meat the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to send to European buyers `` is very acceptable.'' `` There is no health problem involved as we see it,'' he said after meeting with officials of the 12-nation Common Market trade bloc. In <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>, said the ban would take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled. `` We do n't care what the Americans want for their consumers,'' <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said. `` Our legislation goes into effect, and we will apply it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> wants to ban for health reasons all meat from animals treated with growth hormones. Late last year, it agreed to delay implementation of the prohibition until 1989. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had threatened to take retaliatory action against the ban. It maintains that the use of hormones to fatten animals, a common practice among American farmers, is not a health risk. An estimated $ 170 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat exports would be affected by the ban. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the value of meat exports to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is small compared to this year's estimated $ 166 billion two-way trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the trading bloc. But, he said, `` It's large to the people involved.'' He acknowledged a difference of opinion with the community, but said, `` We think we're right.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> and other top trade officials. The talks were held as international trade negotiations in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> were postponed for four months over a stalemate between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Common Market over phasing out agricultural subsidies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to agree to eliminate subsidies it claims distort international trade by supporting cut-rate exports and restricting imports. The Europeans argue they have taken steps to control farm spending and could only agree to reduce the subsidies _ not scrap them altogether. `` There is a general recognition that the system of subsidies to agriculture has got itself structured wrong and is altogether too costly,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said the subsidies cost the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Common Market an estimated $ 200 billion a year. `` There are big stakes involved, economic stakes and political stakes, and that's the reason why people are so intense about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s discussions concluded a two-day trip to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> primarily for a meeting with other foreign ministers of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> <PERSON> Trucking </PERSON>, a highly profitable family business that prides itself on a glistening fleet of modern rigs, has been crippled by the first drivers' strike in its 73-year history. The walkout will enter its second week Sunday, keeping 125 Teamsters in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> jobless and neutralizing <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>'s 24-state distribution network, which revolves around the shipment of newsprint from <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Both sides say the dispute is fueled by years of bad blood between <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are considered to be one of the most corrupt organizations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' company President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> said of the international union. `` Why should you want to deal with them? `` The Teamsters never have been and never will be welcomed here,'' he added. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Liimatainen </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 346 </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> is the most anti-union employer of the 330 companies he has had to deal with as an officer of Local 346. `` For a company that displays a white-horse image out there, it's fair to say that horse has spots on it,'' <PERSON> Liimatainen </PERSON> said ` His -LRB- <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>'s -RRB- total approach is, ` You guys are people I'm going to dictate to.' `` Any time anyone asserted their rights in this union, they -LRB- the company -RRB- had a way of intimidating them,'' he said. Despite a threat that they would be permanently replaced if they struck, by midweek only a handful of drivers had crossed the picket line in front of company headquarters along windswept <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 61 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION>'s north shore, union officials said. The company ordered them to return to work last Monday. <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> said Wednesday the company intends to hire permanent replacements until it is ` back to full strength.'' Striking driver <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a union steward, said he knew of only four replacement hirings. <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> said Monday he was considering options which included renewing contract talks with Local 346 of <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> and Local 160, which covers employees at <ORGANIZATION> Monson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> terminal. On Wednesday, however, he said he did n't see any reason to return to the bargaining table. <PERSON> Liimatainen </PERSON> said Wednesday no new talks were set. He said three mediated negotiating sessions were held before the company's three-year contract proposal was rejected by 99 percent of voting union members The previous two-year contract expired Nov. 26. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and fellow union steward <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deterling </PERSON> said the two sides are not far apart on benefits and could possibly work out a deal on the chief wage issue, mileage pay. Under the expired contract, <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> truckers were paid 23.5 cents a mile. At the average rate of 2,500 miles a week, drivers made about $ 30,500 a year under the old contract, with <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> paying for fuel and maintenance on the trucks. According to the company's latest offer, the mileage rate would increase to 25 cents a mile over three years. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deterling </PERSON> said truckers want wages of 26 cents a mile, the amount they were paid before the industry was deregulated. <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> said he stopped trying to negotiate when he was told `` there would be no contract'' unless the mileage rate was increased by 3 cents. `` They're already above industry standards,'' he said of the wages. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deterling </PERSON> said their top priority in negotiating a new contract is job security, not wages. Work rules under the old contract made it too easy for the company to discriminate against active union members, they said. They want to alter the company's disciplinary point system, under which drivers accumulate points for accidents, speeding and other traffic violations. A total of 35 points in a year could lead to a driver's dismissal under the expired contract. Deterling, 55, said he was fired in 1984 when he was assessed 35 points for an accident. He said the company offered to rehire him with no seniority and less vacation pay, but he declined. With the union's help, he recovered his job and seniority level. Several employees who were not as active in the union agreed to be fired and rehired with a loss of seniority after accumulating more than 35 points in a year, <PERSON> Deterling </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> would not comment on the point system and other rule changes sought by the union, including proposed changes in the grievance policy. But he said the company has never discriminated against union members or anyone else. The company delivers newsprint from mills in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> to newspapers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and ships `` anything from soup to nuts'' on return trips, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The 24-state territory ranges from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and as far south as <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. According to documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> booked $ 1 million in net operating income for the first six months of the year on sales of $ 8.4 million.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Finish Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wheat and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower while most corn and oat futures advanced slightly in subdued trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts attributed the declines to profit-taking and positioning ahead of the weekend. They said wheat also fell on disappointment that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had rejected <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s bid for 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. Soybeans came under additional pressure from mixed forecasts for the weekend weather in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean belt, analysts said. `` Two -LRB- private -RRB- forecasters were predicting rain and another one said it was n't going to rain so they've got some confusion going in the beans,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with the G.H. Miller futures trading division of <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Corn futures were buoyed by expectations for increased export sales, analysts said. At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.27 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.59 -LCB-; oats were 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.05 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 7.73 a bushel

 The stock market showed a slight gain today amid what analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and selling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.14 to 2,143.85 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 737 up, 641 down and 563 unchanged. Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings before they make yearend reports to clients. At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes. Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to discern any trends in the making for stock prices. Rite Aid tumbled 3 -RCB- to 31.

<HEAD>Is the Yield Curve Changing Course?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the world of credit, `` short'' is most definitely in fashion these days, at least from an investor's standpoint Yields on some bills and notes, particularly in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> market, have nearly equaled or surpassed those on longer maturing bonds more so now than at any other time this year. That makes it far more sensible to hold onto the shorter securities. Usually it's the other way around. Long-term rates often are significantly higher to compensate investors for their increased risk. For instance, it's more likely that someone will renege on a 30-year debt than on one lasting three months. There's also increased risk of higher interest rates, which depress a bond's price, and higher inflation, which reduce its real value But now the so-called yield curve, which illustrates the difference between short - and long-term interest rates, appears to be changing Normally in an upward, or `` J'' position, the curve, which has been flat for most of the year, looks close to inverting. By midday Friday, the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond stood at 8.96 percent, lower than the yields of all other bonds and notes of lesser maturities. The 20-year bond was yielding 9.02 percent; the 10-year, 9.01 percent; the four-year, 9.00 percent; and the two-year, 8.99 percent. Treasury bill yields remained a bit lower, however. A quick measure of the curve is the relationship between the three-month bill and the 30-year bond. By Friday afternoon the long bond was 0.79 percentage points higher than the bill. The gap, though, was closing in on the one-year bill, which was yielding 8.90 percent. When the yield curve is in a positive, upward steep the long bond is usually between 1 -LCB- - to 2 percentage points higher in yield. The yield curve theoretically should reflect the expectations of borrowers and investors. One that ascends steeply indicates that the markets expect interest rates and inflation to rise; it also portrays `` easy'' money. The last time the curve inverted was around 1981. The stock market fell into a slump as a result and the nation headed into a recession. Market watchers are n't sure what the current movement of rates means. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, a principal at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects the yield curve to continue to invert but that the economy should n't suffer as a result `` What it -LRB- the inversion -RRB- really means is inflation expectations in this country continue to be reduced as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has done a good job of tightening'' credit, <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> said. `` This is nothing unusual. We have an inverted yield curve in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' he explained. `` The central banks of this world really pay attention in focusing in on inflation fears.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, an economist at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farnham </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that rates might be heading lower soon because the economy is showing signs of slowing down. While short-term rates certainly are attractive now _ not just in <LOCATION> Treasuries </LOCATION>, but in things like certificates of deposits or money market accounts _ Front says he's gradually sinking his money into longer-maturing securities. `` Our own guess is that we're fairly close to a peak in short-term rates. We could see a decline in rates before the end of the first quarter,'' Front said. If that happens, then bond prices will head higher. `` We do n't think we'll have a repeat of the last few cycles where you had a sharply inverted yield curve,'' Front said.

 As winter settles into the Windy City, soybean traders on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> are looking to the south with more than vacations in mind. It's springtime in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, respectively the world's second-and fourth-largest soybean producers, and a dry spell during the South American planting period could prove to be the seedling of another drought rally in the soybean market `` It's sort of analagous to what happened here in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in May or June,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Candor </PERSON>, senior forecaster with <ORGANIZATION> Accu-Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private meteorological information service in <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> College </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` There's still time for the crop to recover if it turns rainy,'' he said. `` But if it stays this dry for the rest of this month into early January, then problems will really start to mount.'' Other experts say the South American weather could stay dry into late January with no significant damage to the soybean crop, and the plants wo n't enter their most critical growth phase until mid-February. But soybean futures traders are scrambling for every available scrap of South American weather information and a recent upswing in prices reflects the generally bullish outlook. Soybeans for delivery in March on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> hit a recent low of $ 7.42 -LCB- a bushel on Nov. 18. On Friday, the contract settled at $ 7.85 \ No one is predicting a return to the highs near $ 11 a bushel reached in July on panic buying linked to the Midwestern drought. But, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of CBOT floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, `` if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> production falters because of weather _ and nobody has that answer yet _ prices could go up by $ 1 to $ 1.50 bushel over next several months.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean market has grown more sensitive to the status of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crop in the last 10 years as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> production has expanded to satisfy the world's increasing appetite for protein. In 1981, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> produced about 470 million bushels of soybeans and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> grew about 154 million bushels. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean output for the 1988-89 season at the equivalent of 734 million bushels and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s at 404 million bushels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's largest producer with this year's output estimated at 1.51 billion bushels. But that figure represents a 21 percent decline from the 1987 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> harvest, and the nation's surplus stockpile is expected to dwindle by the end of August to a scant 125 million bushels as a result. Because of the sharp reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies, `` the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weather this year has probably become the most important in history as far as soybeans are concerned,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Notis </PERSON>, a founding partner of <ORGANIZATION> Freese-Notis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Soybean traders say the South American weather information available from private forecasters varies greatly from one meteorological firm to another and seems less reliable than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weather data. The private forecasters say those problems often stem from their difficulty in getting data from the weather services run by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments. `` It seems that quite often when it rains down there, for some reason they do n't like to report what happened, how much rain fell,'' <PERSON> Notis </PERSON> said. `` Their regular reporting stations sometimes do n't report.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the information his firm receieves through official channels sometimes comes in garbled or just plain wrong. `` Last week <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> -LRB- the location of a Brazilian reporting station -RRB- transmitted 24-hour precipitation of 92 millimeters but it actually received only 0.2 millimeters,'' <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> said. `` That's the difference between 3.6 or 3.7 inches and a trace.'' So private forecasters rely heavily on data from weather satellites. And even though satellite accuracy fades the farther you get from the equator, `` satellites do n't lie,'' <PERSON> Notis </PERSON> said. Private forecasters were hesitant to make long-range predictions about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s soybean weather. But <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> cited a cooling of ocean surface temperatures, which he called the `` La Nina'' effect, the inverse of the better-known `` El Nino.'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> is typically associated with dry-weather years in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, he said. `` There are very strong La <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> signals this year, and that's more likely to give you a crop problem in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they would delay their 1.7 billion-pound, or $ 3.1 billion, joint bid for the British electronics firm <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Deficit Panel Cancels Meeting After Judge Says It Must Be Public</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A bipartisan commission appointed to study ways to reduce the federal budget deficit Friday canceled its next meeting after a judge barred the panel from closing the proceedings to the public. The decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to cancel Monday's meeting at which it was to review budget options and discuss which economic assumptions would be used to make recommendations for deficit reduction. `` It is evident in this case that the public has the right to know the issues at discussion as they develop at the December 12 meeting,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> ruled in granting a temporary restraining order barring a closed proceeding. `` The meeting is canceled,'' commission spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> said following Green's decision. `` We were challenged and we will abide by the court. Where we will go from here, we simply do n't know. The commission has no other scheduled meetings this month and had only discussed tentative dates for discussions in January, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> said. The judge ruled that news organizations that brought the case would likely ultimately be able to prove that closed meetings violate the Federal Advisory Commission Act and the Sunshine Act. `` The commission's insistence on shielding the debate as to budget options from public scrutiny directly contravenes the law,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wrote in an opinion. `` It chops the core of our democratic society: open robust, unvarnished public debate illuminating pressing issues, concerns and policies that affect the lives of all citizens,'' she said. The judge rejected the commission's arguments that because the panel's members were so prestigious, their public discussions of various economic options could wreak havoc with the financial markets. `` The expressions to be presented by these officials are no different than the plethora of economic assessments and predictions -LRB- some optimistic, some grave -RRB- that inundate the public daily,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. While such discussion may result in speculation on financial markets, the effect `` must be balanced against the open society and unfettered public debate on important national issues upon which our democracy is founded,'' the judge said. A closed meeting would more likely encourage speculation, he said, adding: `` Fear flourishes when the process is shrouded in a cloak of secrecy and the swiftest transport to speculation is fear.'' The lawsuit challenging the closed meeting was filed by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, The Wall Street Journal, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes financial newsletters, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildstrom </PERSON>, an editor for Business Week. Public Citizen, a consumer organization founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, represented the news organizations and also joined in the case. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, said: `` The idea that the members of this commission are too prestigious to air their views in public is outrageous, and an affront to our open system of government.''

<HEAD>Wall Street, Investors Weigh Unbundled Stock Units</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street's latest financial product, the unbundled stock unit, is being touted as a way for top-quality companies to unlock the hidden values in their shares without having to dismantle the company. But the proposal has also unleashed a torrent of questions from investors and money managers trying to figure if there is anything in it for them. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which developed the proposal embraced by four major companies earlier this week, has created a product that splits a stock into three components _ a 30-year bond, a preferred stock and a stock appreciation certificate. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have filed documents with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to offer their shareholders a chance to swap up to $ 5.6 billion in stock for new securities. While the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reviews the filings, money managers are trying to figure how the new securities will work, what they will be worth and whether there will be be enough of them that there will be a ready buyer when a holder wants to sell. While their inventors say they were not intended as a takeover defense, some investors say they may have that effect. Critics say the tax savings for issuers inherent in the plans may invite congressional scrutiny. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a professional investor and professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s graduate school of business, said the new securities are `` a waste of time ... I do n't see what's in it for most people.'' `` The question you have to ask yourself is do we really need another piece of paper to maintain our capital system,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreman </PERSON>, director of a money management firm that bears his name. But <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallatin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> executive who oversaw the invention of unbundled stock units, said they will be useful for major companies with credit ratings strong enough to absorb some modest increases in debt. He said they are designed to highlight the three reasons people buy stock _ the chance for a price increase, the dividend and the possibility that the dividend will be raised. The 30-year bond will pay interest equal to the current annual dividend. The preferred stock would pay any increase over the next 30 years in the current level of the dividend. The stock appreciation certificate would entitle the holder to buy a share of the company's stock in 30 years for a pre-set price expected to be slightly higher than the face value of the bond. Investors making the swap would be protected against a dividend reduction, since the dividend would become a fixed interest payment. But some investment managers wonder how liquid the market for the new securities will be. `` You'll only be able to determine that when they come out,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Minter </PERSON>, a partner in the investment advisory firm <ORGANIZATION> Comstock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Gallatin </LOCATION> conceded that since the exchange of stock for an unbundled unit would be taxable, the units should appeal mainly to tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds. Those making the exchange would also give up their voting rights, a development that some analysts suspect management would like. `` If you remove 20 percent of the stock from the market, you could end up with a higher percentage in friendly hands,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Heebner </PERSON>, a portfolio manager at <ORGANIZATION> Loomis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sayles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. From the issuer's standpoint, the security may be especially attractive to companies that feel undervalued, have little debt and want to avoid the heavy borrowing that would be needed to buy back stock for cash. This is particularly attractive at a time when many American managers see other companies succumbing to takeovers at prices far in excess of market values. The publisher <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> foodmaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have all fallen prey in recent months to takeover offers at a huge premiums to their stock prices. The swaps would have a mixed financial impact on an issuer, however. On the one hand, the company loses the flexibility of being able to reduce its costs in bad times. It can always cut a dividend but not interest payments. But the company would save on taxes since interest payments are deductible while dividends are not. `` This plays into the hands of those in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who say debt has become a device for avoiding taxes,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>, trustee of <ORGANIZATION> Batterymarch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. A staffer on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition that he not be identified by name, said the panel has taken no position on whether to investigate the uses of the unbundled stock unit, and said whether it does so may depend on how many companies use it. The one clear winner in all this, investment managers say, will be the underwriters who get a fee for handling the exchanges and the brokers who will get commissions on executing trades involving all of the new products. `` It is a reflection of the battered shape of Wall Street,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Batterymarch </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>.

 The stock market inched ahead today amid what analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and selling. Trading was fairly quiet. Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings before they make yearend reports to clients. At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes. Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to discern any trends in the making for stock prices.

<HEAD>Trade Talks End With Only Tentative Gains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 World trade talks ended inconclusively Friday, with tentative gains in many areas but no sign of compromise on the critical issue of farm supports. `` I suppose we could say it's a semi-success,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON>, minister of international trade for host <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Trade ministers agreed to postpone final action until the first week in April, hoping a way will be found in the meantime to break a deadlock between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over agriculture. Top officials from 103 nations _ including 90 trade ministers _ came to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to prod along the four-year <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of free-trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is the most ambitious round of free-trade talks since formation of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> after World War II, and negotiators are discovering deep sensitivities over agriculture, which had been largely exempted from scrutiny until now. The four-month delay in the so-called midterm review of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> meant that progress was frozen in 11 areas of tentative agreement, including important ones such as freeing trade in services and monitoring nations' trade policies. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON>, the director general of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, will seek to bridge differences over the next four months in the four remaining areas: agriculture, protection of intellectual property, textile tariffs and quotas, and escape clauses from <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules. <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON> expressed optimism that he could persuade the American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> negotiators to yield by appealing to their guilty consciences over the impasse on agriculture. `` When people have bad conscience it's a good start to make a deal,'' he said in a news conference. The farm deadlock had threatened to derail the entire negotiations because some nations that depend on farm exports had warned they would withhold approval of the other agreements unless they got some progress on agriculture. The nations that demanded progress in all areas included <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demanded a commitment by all nations to the eventual elimination of trade-distorting farm subsidies and barriers, while the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> said it was willing to cut but not eliminate such programs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would not discuss short-term measures until it got a commitment on the long-term goal, while the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> said it would not discuss a long-term goal until short-term measures had been agreed upon. These were some of the tentative accords reached in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, subject to approval in April: _ Import tariffs on most goods would be cut by at least the 30 percent achieved in the last <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> round, which ended in 1979. The significance of tariff cuts has diminished somewhat along with the rise in non-tariff barriers. _ Trade in services would be liberalized, although developing nations would be allowed to give their service industries some kind of extra protection. Sectors to be covered would be decided by May 1989. _ To speed up settlement of disputes, all <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> reports on disputes would have to be completed within 15 months unless the parties agreed to an extension. _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be permitted to take trade retaliation outside the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules even if a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> proceeding on its complaint was under way. _ The legality of countries' trade policies would be reviewed every two years for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries; every four years for 16 other countries; and as needed for all other <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> members. _ The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s director general would be instructed to seek closer ties to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and report back by September 1989. _ Developed countries would lower barriers to imports of tropical products such as coffee, bananas and rubber from developing nations. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would go ahead with its concessions on tropical products and eliminate tariffs on imports from some of the world's poorest countries without waiting for the April meeting.

 While <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> soothed world tensions with some suave diplomacy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Americans were taking a tougher approach at trade talks in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and ruffling feathers. In fact, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators at the free-trade negotiations this past week were less yielding than a <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadiens </ORGANIZATION> goaltender, demanding a commitment by all nations to total elimination of trade-distorting farm subsidies and barriers. They did n't get what they wanted. And by pressing that single demand relentlessly, they jeopardized progress on other trade issues that are dear to Americans, such as getting developing nations to honor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights and patents. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was winning worldwide applause as a peacemaker with his announcement of plans to cut Soviet armed forces by 500,000 worldwide and pull back 10,000 tanks from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The irony was that in both cases, perception was the biggest element of the story. In the hubbub over <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initiative, it was little noted that <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces would continue to vastly outnumber <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hand was forced by the crisis in his own overstretched economy. Likewise, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came across as a bad guy in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> trade talks even though its goal _ eradicating farm subsidies _ was a popular one. Among other things, eliminating the subsidies would save money and cut food bills for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European taxpayers while allowing developing nations to generate an extra $ 26 billion a year in agricultural exports. The ultimate success of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tactics remains to be seen. It could yet turn out that an unyielding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand was exactly what was needed to force the Europeans into getting serious about cutting farm programs. `` Agriculture is too important to simply nibble at the edges of reform,'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the hard-charging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, told delegates from 103 nations in his closing statement Friday. But whatever the possible long-term gains, the only immediate effects of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unwillingness to discuss short-term measures without agreement on a long-term goal were these: _ No agreements were reached on cutting expensive farm programs. _ Chances increased that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would approve new export subsidies in what could become an escalating conflict with the Europeans. _ Developing nations were embittered by the stalemate, which deprived them of gains they had hoped to make in freer farm exports. _ In retaliation, a bloc of developing nations managed to prevent final adoption of agreements in other areas, such as freer trade in services. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably could have gotten farther if it had been willing to compromise, says <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON>, a New York-based negotiation expert who admits he is no expert on world trade. `` There's an old theory that if you make the first concession in a negotiation you show your weakness, but that's not true,'' said <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON>. To him, Exhibit No. 1 of the value of unilateral concessions is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s troop reduction announcement at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` They took what they had to do and made it to their advantage. What does 95 percent of the world think? That <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a peacemaker.'' Similarly, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators could have come across as peacemakers on trade if they had announced some cut in farm subsidies and invited other countries to follow suit for the good of all, <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON> said. Everybody wins in a good negotiation, said <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON>, the author of 14 books and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Negotiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. That view from an admitted novice on farm trade happens to go along with pleadings this past week by <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. According to a new <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> report, nations can benefit by cutting farm subsidies even if others do not immediately follow suit, so it makes sense to go first. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> report is somewhat politically naive: It is hard to expect American farmers to relinquish export markets, even temporarily, without a fight. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is tired of making concessions that are n't matched, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm negotiator, said in a news conference `` Over 40 years we have learned that the rest of the world has not followed suit ... So, no more.'' Where the Americans erred, <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON> believes, was in feeling that the goal of free farm trade justified the means of stonewalling. `` We can have glamorous ends, but if we ignore the means to these ends we're never going to get anything,'' <PERSON> Nierenberg </PERSON> said. `` Hanging tough is not an achievement; coming up with creative solutions is.''

<HEAD>Eastern Denies Sales Operation Split Intended To Ease Sale Of
Carrier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Friday denied speculation that a move to break up the sales force it shares with <ORGANIZATION> Continential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is intended to do anything but sell more tickets. `` It has absolutely nothing to do with anything except better customer service and selling our core markets to the public,'' said <PERSON> Cori </PERSON> <PERSON> Zywotow </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> manager of corporate communications marketing. But labor officials said there may be other reasons for the move to separate the two carriers' sales forces, which were combined after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought both airlines. `` It may indicate the company is being readied for sale,'' said <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has insisted the money-losing airline is not for sale. But speculation increased after real estate magnate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> negotiated to buy Eastern's most profitable division, the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle linking <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, for $ 365 million cash. Eastern lost about $ 234 million in the first nine months of the year and has laid off about 3,500 employees in recent months. Other union officials speculated that the sales change may be an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to keep Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> from being declared one carrier for labor representation purposes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been addressing that matter in hearings since last summer. Eastern-Continental Sales was formed when the operations were put together to improve efficiency. Its representatives called on travel agents, promoting group packages, charters and special fares offered by the two carriers. `` This was one of the things where we had great consternation when we did it,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said Thursday. `` We have felt, and the sales people have told us this, that it's very difficult to sell two products.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> says the carriers are independent and he has no plans to merge them. He turned the chairmanship of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> over to <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, earlier this week. The present sales team will be split in half, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. Each will be based at its carrier's headquarters. Eastern salespeople will report to <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, vice president of passenger sales. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will report to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> vice president of marketing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` It's really going back and concentrating our energies on Eastern and emphasizing our sales programs and distinctive features,'' <PERSON> Zywotow </PERSON> said. `` And we're expecting that with a dedicated sales force that we can concentrate on our tradtional core markets'' along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.

 The stock market posted some small gains Friday amid what analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and selling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.78 to 2,143.49, closing out the week with a net gain of 51.21 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 769 up, 639 down and 581 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 133.77 million shares, against 124.15 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 154.77 million shares. Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings before they make yearend reports to clients. At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes. Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to discern any trends in the making for stock prices. Wall Streeters were also looking ahead to a full menu of econonic news next week, including the monthly report on the nation's trade balance, which is scheduled to be issued on Wednesday. Economists at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> project the figure for October to be little changed from September, when imports exceeded exports by $ 9 billion excluding freight and insurance costs. Rite Aid sustained one of the day's largest percentage losses, tumbling 3 -LCB- to 31 \ The company estimated a 20 percent decline in earnings for the fiscal quarter that ended Nov. 26. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 120 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> dropped -RRB- to 45 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 29 -LCB- <ORGANIZATION> Xtra </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 ~ to 37 An investor group disclosed that it held a 5.29 percent stake in the company and was considering a leveraged buyout. <ORGANIZATION> Burndy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gained -LRB- to 25 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Framatome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said it began a $ 26-a-share tender offer for the company's stock after <ORGANIZATION> Burndy </ORGANIZATION> directors approved the bid and recommended that shareholders accept it. <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LCB- to 4 -LCB- in the over-the-counter market. The company said the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> asked for more proof of the safety and effectiveness of its Therfectin antiarthritis drug before the product is submitted for approval. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 3.83 billion, or 0.14 percent, in value.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Biggest Casualty Yet of Insider Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned Friday, the highest-ranking government official to quit in the aftermath of an insider trading scandal, while critics intensified demands for a full-scale probe of the share purchases by politicians. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said he was resigning as finance minister and deputy premier to take responsibility for conflicting statements in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> regarding his involvement in questionable purchases of stock of the real estate firm <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` My explanations were n't sufficient and I am taking responsibility,'' <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> told reporters after he informed Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> he was quitting. He also said he hoped his resignation would facilitate passage of a major tax reform package through the Parliament. `` Accomplishing tax reform is my mission,'' <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said. `` It does n't matter what happens to me.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who is expected to announce a Cabinet shuffle in the next few weeks, told reporters later that he would assume the finance portfolio. He refused to comment, however, on how long he would hold that reponsibility. More than a dozen leading politicians, including <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, have been linked to the stock profiteering deal devised by businessman <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, founder of the information conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> reportedly offered certain individuals the opportunity to purchase bargain-priced shares in <LOCATION> Recruit-Cosmos </LOCATION>, a Recruit affiliate, prior to their over-the-counter listing in October 1986 Shortly after the shares were offered for public trading, their value rose sharply and earned large profits for holders, many of whom were also provided with interest-free financing to buy the shares. Opposition leaders spearheading a probe of the stock deal _ dubbed Recruit-gate as a parallel to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Watergate scandal _ have charged that politicians were offered the lucrative shares in return for political favor. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> himself came under fire after delivering several conflicting reports regarding his former secretary's role in the incident. He initially testified to a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal that a third party, a friend of his former secretary, purchased 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares and only borrowed the name of `` Miyazawa.'' He later admitted his ex-secretary actually paid 30 million yen, or about $ 246,000, for the shares in September 1986 and sold them for 52.7 million yen or $ 431,000 less than a month later after they were listed without the finance minister's knowledge. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> also insisted the stock purchase was not financed by a Recruit-linked financial institution but refused to show bank documents to back up his argument. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> is the largest casualty to date in the five-month-old scandal that has shaken public confidence in <LOCATION> Takeshita </LOCATION> government. Public support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government dropped to 18 percent from 30 percent when he assumed office a year ago, according to a survey released Friday by the mass-circulation newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. The leading opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other critics said <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s resignation was overdue but renewed demands for a stepped-up investigation of the scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a leading liberal daily, said it was time for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to heed the opinion polls and `` listen to the voice of the people'' who want the Recruit affair cleared up.

<HEAD>Judge Puts Commission Action Against Hunts On Hold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge has approved a request to forestall action by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against two of the Hunt brothers of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> while they work out Chapter 11 reorganization settlements. `` We had an order -LRB- that -RRB- enjoined the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from proceedings until other matters are resolved,'' said Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> of his 36-page opinion handed down Thursday in the cases of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> complaint claims the two <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> businessmen, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, and others manipulated the price of silver futures between fall 1979 and March 1980. Silver prices collapsed to $ 10 an ounce on March 27, 1980, after previously hitting a high of $ 52 an ounce. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and a spokesman for the brothers, said the Hunts are pleased with <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s decision. `` Our ongoing intent is still intact _ that is to get all these proceedings into one forum,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> estimated it could be 12 to 14 months before the bankruptcy court matters are resolved. Attorneys for the Hunts filed statements of financial affairs and schedules of assets and liabilities in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month. Now creditors have until mid-January to file claims with the court, <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tese </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bankruptcy attorney whose firm <ORGANIZATION> Cole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Deitz </PERSON> has been observing the Hunt case, said <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s decision means damages and claims against the brothers take precedence over fines and penalties that might be imposed. `` The decision of the bankruptcy court judge is not an unusual one at all,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tese </PERSON> said. `` It's in keeping with the spirit of the bankruptcy code.'' She said the decision apparently does not mean the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> will drop its civil complaint against the Hunts. `` It's possible that they will proceed at some later date,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, who is handling the case, did not immediately return telephone calls to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. In September, administrative law Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipe </PERSON> ruled that the Hunts' personal bankruptcy court filings did not automatically block the government's case against the brothers. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s complaint is the biggest market manipulation case ever filed by the commission. If the Hunts lose, they could face fines of $ 100,000 for each violation of federal commodity laws and be premanently banned from trading in all futures markets. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s ruling also means the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> can not press its case until appeals are heard involving the Hunts' lawsuit with the Peruvian company <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and their brother, <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, and others were ordered by a federal court jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to pay Minpeco, the Peruvian governments' silver mining company, $ 134.6 million. The company had lost millions of dollars in the silver price squeeze.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Lower in Choppy European Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The dollar was mixed against the major foreign currencies Friday as investors turned their sights toward trade deficit figures to be released next week. Gold prices were also mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 422.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up from $ 421.30 late Thursday, but the metal declined in overseas trading. Dollar trading was lackluster as investors squared their positions in advance of the weekend and Wednesday's scheduled release of balance of trade figures for October. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the dollar would remain stable until the report is released. Overseas, dealers said the dollar was pressured lower by strength in the West German mark. They said the mark rose amid speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> would raise its Lombard rate by a half percentage point to 5.5 percent. The Lombard rate is the interest the central bank charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as collateral. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the dollar slipped to 1.7330 marks from 1.7420 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it fell to 1.73525 marks from 1.73865. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.59 yen to a closing 122.43 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 122.30 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 122.49 yen from 122.30 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.8490 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8510 Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound was worth $ 1.8495, compared with late Thursday's $ 1.85505 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.4620 Swiss francs, down from 1.4633; 5.9290 French francs, down from 5.9350; 1,282.75 Italian lire, down from 1,283.00; and 1.19665 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19275. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4605 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 5.9240 French francs, down from 5.9450; 1.9560 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9645; 1,280.25 Italian lire, down from 1,285.00; 1.1970 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1933 Gold closed at $ 422.90 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 421.30 late Thursday. But gold fell earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 420.75 a troy ounce, compared with $ 423.50 late Thursday, and in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it closed at a bid $ 420.30, compared with $ 423 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>A Muted Yearend Rally On Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The storied yearend rally has arrived on schedule for Wall Street, but not quite with its usual measure of holiday-season cheer. Even as stock prices were rising in the past week, some of the largest securities firms were issuing cautious appraisals of the investment outlook for 1989. And what many analysts were calling the `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rally'' showed signs of faltering even before the Soviet leader's historic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit was abruptly overshadowed by the disastrous earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. At first, it seemed that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pledge to reduce the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military forces and spending had the makings of a major stimulus for the American stock and bond markets. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in turn could decrease defensive spending, relieve pressure on an overheated economy, and thereby reduce the federal budget deficit,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Government bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, staged their strongest single-day rally in three months. But the stock market, after responding enthusiastically to advance reports of the message <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was bringing, leveled off by the time he actually delivered it. Many market participants quickly shifted their attention back to the prospect of further credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to keep economic growth restrained. `` The caveat as to the sustainability of this rally rests on the trend and level of interest rates,'' <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON> observed. `` While the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposal is a giant step in the right direction, we question whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> or other central banks dare relax their monetary reins.'' Analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, in issuing their 1989 forecast, predicted a further rise in interest rates before they turn downward next year. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, the firm's chief economist, said he expected the yield on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, recently hovering around 9 percent, to average 9.3 percent in the first quarter of the new year. `` Later in 1989,'' he added, `` a weakening economy and a leveling of inflation should cause a substantial decline'' in rates. At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 2,143.49, up 51.21 points from the week before.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Hit New 4-Month High On Brazil Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices soared to four-month highs Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations of reduced availabilty of sugar from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, analysts said. On other markets, coffee, cattle, pork, energy and precious-metals futures all gained; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. Sugar for delivery in March settled .55 cent higher at 11.86 cents a pound, the highest daily settlement since Aug. 5, on rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to announce a diversion of substantially more sugar cane from sugar-making to alcohol production. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has embraced the use of gasohol _ an automobile fuel made from gasoline and alcohol _ like no other country. A recent <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement to limit crude-oil production has pushed oil and gasoline prices higher, which in turn has led to speculation that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will renew its efforts to encourage gasohol use, analysts said. If the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> does indeed announce a greater diversion of sugar cane to alcohol production scheduled for release on Monday, `` obviously that would mean less sugar would be available for exporting purposes,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sugar prices had fallen earlier in the week on speculation that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> would soon emerge as a large-volume seller of sugar on the world market. `` This has really turned that situation upside down,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. Brazilian concerns also fueled a strong rally in the coffee market. It's been a dry spring so far in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest coffee producer, and fears of drought damage to the 1988-89 Brazilian coffee crop have begun to surface. Meanwhile, the weather in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the No. 2 coffee producer, has been extremely wet, hampering the harvest of the 1987-88 coffee crop, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Coffee settled .29 cent to 1.60 cent higher with March at $ 1.2727 a pound. Livestock and meat futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on bullish signals from the cash markets, including the first signs of a significant drop in hog slaughters since early 1987. Hog kills for the day totaled 337,000 compared to 339,000 a year ago, and kills for the week totaled 1.881 million vs. 1.879 million a year ago. The current figures were closer to year-ago figures than the market has seen in more than a year, and the weekly total was about 3 percent below the previous week, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Pork futures traders have been expecting a slowdown in slaughters for some time, he said, adding: `` anyone with bullish aspirations had to be licking their lips today. Live cattle settled .95 cent to 1.10 cents higher with December at 71.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to 1.08 cents higher with January at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to 1.13 cents higher with December at 41.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .85 cent to 1.23 cents higher with February at 43.25 cents a pound. Oil futures finished on a strong note at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on feelings the market is bound to rise if members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> stick by their new crude-oil production quotas. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 40 cents higher with January at $ 15.84 a barrel; heating oil was 1.42 cents to 1.80 cents higher with January at 49.50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .53 cent to 1.19 cents higher with January at 44.46 cents a gallon. Precious-metals futures followed the oil market higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 90 cents to $ 1.10 higher with February at $ 427.60 a troy ounce; silver was 4.2 cents to 4.7 cents higher with March at $ 6.305 a troy ounce. Wheat and soybean futures prices finished mostly lower while most corn and oat futures advanced slightly in subdued trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with December at $ 4.27 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.59 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.05 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with January at $ 7.73 -LCB- a bushel. Stock-index futures finished slightly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .25 point lower at 280.45. Each point is worth $ 500.

<HEAD>Minnesota Dropped For Clean Coal Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has ended negotiations with the state of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> aimed at financing one of the department's `` clean coal'' demonstration projects. Instead, the department will begin negotiations with sponsors of other potential projects in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> had proposed to join <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in an advanced ironmaking project near <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, using raw coal in a low-pollution system. Most iron production requires the conversion of coal into coke. The department said the state had been unable after a year of trying to win financial backing for its share in the project. The `` clean coal'' program requires local sponsors to put up at least half the cost of a project. The decision to end negotiations does not mean there were any technical flaws or that the state had been unresponsive, just that `` financial support was not available to allow the project to proceed in a timely manner.'' The decision will free about $ 25 million to $ 30 million in federal funds and the department said it would open negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to extend an existing coal-cleaning project sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Homer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to demonstrate the recovery of low-sulfur coal particles from a mine waste disposal pond at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; and with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to upgrade western coals by reducing moisture and sulfur content at <LOCATION> Colstrip </LOCATION>, Mont. The clean coal program is aimed at financing $ 5 billion worth of projects over five years, at least half the money to come from non-federal sources.

 <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said Friday he liked the name `` The Mirage'' so much, he paid $ 500,000 to use it for his new $ 585 million resort on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>'s announcement ended speculation that the new resort on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would carry the same name as his hotel-casino in the downtown's Glitter Gulch. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said he and others at the resort knew they had to have a new name for the new property, or the downtown Golden Nugget would become know as `` the old one'' and the Strip resort `` the new one.'' `` It did n't seem fair that this property would be called ` the old one,''' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said. The downtown casino dates to 1946, but renovations, a new tower and luxury suites have pushed the value to $ 200 million, <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said. The gaming chief said he settled on the name `` The Mirage'' because of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> theme, then had to wrestle with the problem of two other <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> motels that carry the same name. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said he went to the owners of the Mirage Motel and La Mirage, and paid them $ 250,000 each to change their name as of July 1. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said the new property will open early next December. He said he planned to be a major player in bringing boxing matches to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, joining <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> and neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> as a major promoter of the events. `` We're going to be the third player in the game,'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said he had no intention of selling his downtown property. `` It has broken every profit record this year,'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said. `` It's one of the most successful entities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Anything's for sale,'' he added, qualifying his statement. `` I did n't think I'd ever sell <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, then they came along and offered me $ 440 million.'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> sold his Golden Nugget hotel and casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices ended mixed in slow trading Friday, reflecting what credit-market strategists called uncertainty over the direction of interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond rose about -LRB- point or $ 1.25 per $ 1,000 in face amount, and its yield eased to 8.95 percent from 8.96 percent Thursday. One noteworthy development was a rise in rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes to yield more than that of 30-year bonds, an unusual shift that last occurred prior to the 1981-82 recession. But the significance of the so-called inverted yield curve remains unclear. Bond strategists said the market was influenced largely by confusion over whether or when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will move to tighten credit conditions in order to pre-empt inflationary pressure and keep the dollar stable. They said the confusion may be clarified somewhat next Wednesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release the market-sensitive monthly trade deficit figures for October. A large imbalance could hurt the dollar's value and force the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments fell -LRB- point, intermediate maturities fell \ point and long-term issues rose -LRB- point, the <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, financial information service reported. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.45 to 1,135.57. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also fell. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, lost 1.00 to 295.10. Prices strengthened slightly in the tax-exempt market. The Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was up 7-32 point at 90 as of 3 p.m. EST. The average yield to maturity was 7.90 percent, down from 7.92 percent Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 8.14 percent as the discount fell 8 basis points to 7.88 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.67 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 8.21 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.92 percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to 8.28 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 8 -LCB- percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

 Plans by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to buy half of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s refining and marketing assets could further erode the domestic oil industry and increase reliance on foreign supplies, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said Friday in asking the treasury secretary to investigate the proposed deal. `` The enormity of this acquisition causes us to believe a second look should be taken at the matter, because of its possible impact on the domestic oil and gas industry and on our ability to become energy independent,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingamon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to investigate the joint venture, named <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, on national security grounds The Saudi-Texaco deal, announced Nov. 10, would include three refineries, 50 distribution terminals, 1,400 service stations and 10,000 franchised gasoline stations in 23 Eastern and Gulf Coast states. In their letter, the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> said they believe the acquisition falls under the law enabling the government to block mergers involving a foreign interests if there is evidence that national security is threatened. The acquisition, they wrote, could `` seriously increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil, threaten the viability of the domestic oil industry and jeopardize the well-being of American consumers.'' `` The lessons of the 1973-74 oil embargo and the 1978-79 shortage taught our country all too well the economic and political consequences of reliance on vulnerable oil supplies,'' the letter said. `` What is particulary noteworthy is that 96 percent of the capacity of the three refineries will be used in refining Saudi Arabian crude oil,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` So you've got a circumstance that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has guaranteed itself an outlet for crude oil into the American market, giving them the option of lowering crude prices while earning increased prices at the gasoline marketing level. This could amount to an enormous loss to domestic producers and leave us even more dependent on foreigh oil.'' Also, he said, foreign countries are immune from our antitrust laws, `` so it's not clear we could enforce antitrust laws against this merged entity if needed to do so to protect consumers from market manipulation.'' He said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has announced a concerted effort to expand its dominance in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil markets and that its goal is to become the 10th largest seller of gasoline in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a first step.

Companies that have already adopted Statement 96 are not permitted to revert to previously applied accounting principles, the board ruled.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge ruled Friday that <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> understated the role of its investment banker during its $ 970 million offer for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and said he would issue an order halting the hostile bid. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said he would stay the order pending an appeal by <PERSON> MAI </PERSON> <PERSON> Basic </PERSON> to the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had played a much larger role in the deal than MAI Basic, which is controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, had disclosed in filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s extensive role in advising and financing the $ 20-a-share bid turned it from an investment banker into a bidder. Prime had alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> controlled the bid through a series of investment partnerships that were not disclosed in federal filings. The judge also said MAI Basic should have been more forthright about past legal problems involving <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weksel </PERSON>, who together own 43 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION>'s shares and have been named as defendants in past shareholder lawsuits. MAI Basic, a computer company based in <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said in a statement: `` While we have not yet seen the written order, we do not believe that it will in any way impede the consummation of our offer.'' Prime closed at $ 16.75, down 37.5 cents, in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Trading Friday. The bid for Natick-based Prime was made Nov. 15 and is scheduled to expire Dec. 21. Prime, which is about four times the size of its potential buyer, late last month rejected the MAI Basic offer. MAI Basic owns 4.1 percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares outstanding. Prime sued MAI Basic in federal court about one week after the takeover bid surfaced. In a separate legal matter, the two companies squared off in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, on Friday over a request by MAI Basic for a preliminary injunction against Prime's antitakoever defenses Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Maurie </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> heard two hours of oral arguments but withheld a decision on the injunction. MAI Basic maintains that Prime enacted a `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan in October to forestall a potential takeover. Prime is second to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the field of computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. It also makes sophisticated computer workstations for engineers and database management systems. Prime reported earnings of $ 33.4 million, or 69 cents a share, on revenue of $ 1.16 billion for the first three quarters of 1988. MAI Basic reported earnings of $ 18.7 million, or $ 1.25 a share, on revenue of $ 302.9 million.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, the would-be financial adviser who bilked investors out of $ 15 million to fund a lavish lifestyle of expensive artworks, luxury cars and posh homes, was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison by a judge who called him `` amoral, not immoral.'' Asking the judge to give <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, 24, a shorter sentence than the three-year term handed master Wall Street criminal <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s lawyer described him as a `` greedy young man and a product of our times.'' `` When he grew up, greed was on the ascendency,'' said the lawyer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> should n't wind up being the scapegoat of the 1980s.'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said he was imposing the stiff sentence because it was `` absolutely essential'' to send a message to those who act through `` greed and insatiable lust for despoiling innocent people.'' The high-living Bloom, whose massive swindle scheme earned him the title `` Wall Street Whiz Kid,'' pleaded guilty last March to one count each of mail fraud and securities fraud. Most of the investors he conned were friends of his parents, according to prosecutors. In a 15-page sentencing memo to the judge, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> `` victimized close friends of his parents'' and `` betrayed the trust not only of these friends but also of his parents.'' Noting that several of <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s victims had turned over pension plans and individual retirement accounts to him, the memo said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> `` took everything he could from people who loved him; in so doing, he exhibited a legal and moral depravity.'' `` I have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me,'' the short, bespectacled <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, standing with his hands crossed in front of him, told the judge. He conceded he was `` deserving of punishment'' but <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> urged the judge to show leniency because `` this is not <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> or -LRB- convicted inside trader -RRB- <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to securities law conspiracy and is cooperating with investigators, was sentenced to three years in prison last December. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, an investment banker caught in a massive insider trading scheme, was sentenced to two years in 1986. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s crime `` a bizarre aberration,'' and told the judge that a stiff sentence was `` not going to discourage the next screwball who comes along.'' But <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> concluded <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> was `` remorseless, completely lacking in conscience. He was a predator, completely insensitive.'' <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> to four years on each count and, in an unusual move, ordered the prison terms to run consecutively as spectators in the crowded courtroom gasped. `` He went on his way without any thought of the pain, suffering and misery he was inflicting,'' said a disgusted <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. `` He was amoral, not immoral.'' The judge said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> had `` cannibalized his family and friends.'' He also ordered <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> to make `` full restitution.'' No fine was imposed. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> could have sentenced <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> to 10 years in prison and $ 20 million in fines. According to prosecutors, the boyish-looking <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> used deceit and fraud to parlay a college investment club into a multimillion-dollar investment operation with about 140 clients. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who was not registered as an investment adviser, wooed investors for his now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by falsely claiming his clientele included the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family and entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. A 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate with an art history degree, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> told clients he was putting their money into the stock market when he actually was using it to pay for a lavish lifestyle that included art works worth $ 5.5 million; an $ 830,000 condominium on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>; a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach house worth $ 1.9 million; and two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> _ worth $ 200,000 Among the paintings <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> purchased with other people's money were works by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> began sending his investors bogus account statements that claimed to show their securities holdings, according to the charges. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> also was charged with using new clients' funds to pay `` profits'' to older clients. Last January, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> brought civil charges against <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who settled by agreeing to turn over his assets to a court-appointed receiver and to stay out of the securities industry for the rest of his life. Under the settlement, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> neither admitted nor denied the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> allegations but criminal charges were brought in March. Bloom waived indictment and pleaded guilty March 31 to one count each of mail and securities fraud.

 After a volatile week, oil futures prices finished on a strong note. `` The market closed at one of its highest levels in a long time,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 40 cents higher Friday at $ 15.84 cents a barrel, after falling 30 cents on Thursday during a technical selloff. The contract had been up and down throughout the week. Other contract months also gained ground Friday. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the January contract for wholesale home heating oil closed 1.42 cents higher at 49.50 cents a gallon. The contract had fallen 0.81 cent on Thursday. Traders said seasonal demand was responsible for the sharp price increase. January unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.17 cent in the previous session, settled at 44.46 cents a gallon, up 0.53 cent. <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON> said there was `` no real news, no real fundamental reason'' for Friday's rally. `` Except there's a feeling the market can work higher if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> sticks to its quotas,'' he said. In late November, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> reached a production agreement aimed at propping up sagging worldwide oil prices.
