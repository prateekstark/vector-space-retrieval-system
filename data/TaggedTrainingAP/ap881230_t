 A woman says she read a prayer book and somehow managed to stay calm while trapped nearly 18 hours in a cold elevator at the high school where she works as an accountant. `` I thought it would be nice at one point to scream, rant and rave, but that would not get me anywhere,'' <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>, 58, said Thursday. `` So I took out my rosary and started praying. I had a beautiful prayer book with me that I read most of the night. I did n't sleep.'' Finally, at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, interim superintendent of buildings and grounds at <ORGANIZATION> Wayland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in this southeast <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> city, asked <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> if she was in the elevator. `` And I said, ` Yes, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, get me out of here,'' she recalled. He did. <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> was going to her office in a new building at the private school when she stepped into the elevator around 1 p.m. Tuesday. `` The elevator did n't move, but the door would n't open,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. `` I rang the bell, I rang the bell, I rang the bell, and it did n't do me any good,'' <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said. `` From 1 p.m. to about 4:15 p.m. I rang the bell about every 15 minutes or when I heard a noise. After 4:30, I figured no one was coming. `` Hypothermia crossed my mind,'' she said. `` It was so cold. I had my coat on and my gloves. ... I used my purse to block vents in the walls where cold air was coming through.'' She kept ringing the bell. And she prayed. `` My faith kept me going and kept me calm,'' <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> was found after a police officer told a cleaning woman at the school that a buzzer had been going off at the new building, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Religion Writers Vote Swaggart Scandal Top Story Of 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defrocking of TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> after he allegedly paid a prostitute to pose naked and talk dirty was the top religion story of 1988, says a national poll of religion writers released today. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was also picked as the religion newsmaker of the year in the poll of the <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newswriter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 200-plus active members, who write for newspapers, magazines and news services. Forty-three members responded. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> stayed out of the pulpit for three months after tearfully confessing to an unspecified sin. But he refused to accept a one-year suspension imposed on him by the Assemblies of God denomination and resigned from the ministry the day his defrocking was announced in April. Another television evangelist, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, also figured in the news in 1988, but his indictment this month by a federal grand jury on charges he misused millions of dollars from his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry came too late in the year to be included in the poll. The protest campaign against showings of the controversial movie `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' ranked second in the poll. Evangelical and fundamentalist Christians denounced the film as blasphemous. Third was the election of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as suffragen -LRB- assistant -RRB- bishop of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Episcopal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>, making her the first woman bishop in the worldwide Anglican Communion. The other top 10 religion stories, in order, were: _ Two religious leaders, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, wage aggressive but unsuccessful campaigns for presidential nominations; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> elected with support from the religious right. _ Reform policies help ease some religious restrictions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as celebrations marking the millennium of Christianity there are attended by spiritual dignitaries from 100 nations. _ Scientific tests find the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, long venerated as the burial cloth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, to be medieval in origin. _ The Operation Rescue anti-abortion group sponsors demonstrations blocking entrances to abortion clinics, with some 2,000 protesters arrested in 27 cities. _ Rebel Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> consecrates bishops in defiance of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and is excommunicated. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, in a financial crisis, calls for another reorganization and hints at forming a broader ecumenical structure including <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and evangelical churches. _ Orthodox Jewish religious parties demanding controversial amendment to the Law of Return appear to hold balance of power after election in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The poll was conducted by <PERSON> Willmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorkelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, a past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newswriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Other labor leaders shun <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> and he rivals <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as a hate figure for the left, but many see the maverick union boss as a natural product of the prime minister's age of enterprise. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> is the polecat of organized labor, particularly since his electricians' union was expelled from the national labor federation, and he appears to enjoy the role. His eyes twinkle as he lauds laws that have emasculated the once-mighty labor movement since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won power in 1979. `` I'm only half-joking when I say we'll be erecting statues to the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> before the end of the century,'' he said. `` Why? Because they will have saved the trade union movement from itself.'' Labor legislation in the Thatcher decade has outlawed sympathy walkouts, forced secret-ballot membership votes before strikes are called and empowered employers to sue unions for damages resulting from illegal strikes. A revolution was wrought in British working practices, and <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s 360,000-member Electrical, Electronic, <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> joined it. In his office at the union's elegant headquarters, a converted mansion in commuter country 10 miles from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> continues the union-baiting that got him banished from the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the 9 million-member British labor federation. He is accused of splitting organized labor, making cozy no-strike deals with employers, invading the territory of other unions and, through a 1986 deal with publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to run his high-technology presses, breaking the power of newspaper production unions. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, 59, is a sharp contrast and constant provocation to left-wing leaders of old, traditional unions: <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Scargill </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, and the huge <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> with its 1,250,000 members. `` Hard times have been forced upon the unions and the way <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> has tried to solve this is through sweetheart deals with employers,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, an official of the transport union. `` A strike is always a weapon of last resort. The question is whether union officials have the right to surrender that resort.'' In September, the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expelled <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s electricians for refusing to abandon single-union, no-strike deals with a Japanese electronics company in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and a British food chain <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, unrepentant, delivered his credo in a final speech to the federation's annual conference and walked out before the expulsion vote was taken. `` Our members,'' he thundered, `` reveal an enthusiasm for the market system and its values and infuriate the sherry-party revolutionaries with their model resolutions and conference-hall rhetoric.'' He is negotiating a merger with the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which has 800,000 members and is the nation's second largest after the transport workers. If that goes through next year, the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must either take the electricians back in their new form or risk the emergence of a rival federation of the highest-skilled workers. Although <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> is isolated, at least for now, he sees himself as the smart kid on the block, the adapter to modern realities in a bleak time for organized labor. Membership in unions belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has declined from nearly 13 million to under 9 million since 1979. Nearly 50 percent of British workers belonged to unions then, but only 35 percent do now. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s background is impeccably working class. He is the son of a paper-mill timekeeper, grew up in a modest home at <LOCATION> Gravesend </LOCATION>, 20 miles east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and became an apprentice electrician at 16. He began as a leftist, he said, but moved right. Communists took over the union but were kicked out in a 1962 ballot-rigging scandal and the right has controlled it since. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapple </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s Cockney predecessor, was the scourge of the left in the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which unions founded and finance. <PERSON> Chapple </PERSON>, now a life peer sitting in the non-elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, warned his many enemies in the <ORGANIZATION> Tredes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when he retired four years ago: `` You think I'm right-wing? Wait till you see <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>.'' Experience bore him out. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> has excoriated the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for, as he put it, consorting with `` terrorists, lesbians and other queer folk.'' He has pushed single-union deals, with or without no-strike clauses that stipulate binding arbritration. Unions have made more than 30 such arrangements, mainly with Japanese electronic companies _ often after several unions vie to offer managers the most attractive package. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s alliance with <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> revolutionized the newspaper industry in less than two years. When <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> fired 5,000 production workers in January 1986 for striking against new high-tech machinery, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> and his electricians moved in to run the presses. With the production unions vanquished, the rest of the national newspaper industry quickly followed suit. `` The other unions were demanding jobs for life ... and <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said, ` Get lost','' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said in the interview. `` I do n't see how we could have acted any differently.'' `` These deals are what our members want, and that's what it's all about _ membership. We're operating in a tough environment.''

<TEXT>
 A nation known for its squeamishness about sex is paying for its prudishness with rampant divorce and abortions, and an increasingly frustrated and puzzled populace, a Soviet sex expert says. Despite a spirit of openness and a freer discussion of once sensitive subjects, philosopher <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> believes the Soviets desperately need to engage in some frank banter about the boudoir. `` Things that newspapers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> already are writing about, and which even have become sensations, are n't even known by specialists here,'' said the 60-year-old doctor of philosophy. Although the social chill on discussing sex is thawing a bit, sex is still a taboo topic in a country known for its puritanism, where even the Russian language lacks a polite word for love making. On a recent televised discussion between panels of Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students, the Americans spoke freely about the problems of teen-age pregnancy and other sex-related subjects. But when an American asked whether there were similar woes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the half-joking answer was: `` We do n't have sex.'' Evidence points to the contrary in this nation of nearly 285 million people, however. Western specialists say Soviet women average nine abortions, and the number of AIDS cases, while small, is growing. Such problems makes it necessary to deal openly with sex, said <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, who is trying to take President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost _ or openness _ behind the bedroom doors. `` If we do n't do anything ... we will create new difficulties. The stability of marriage will suffer,'' he said at a recent lecture to an overflow crowd at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s House of Actors. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> recently returned from a 3 -LCB- - month stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he visited AIDS clinics and family planning centers He told his audience that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is far behind the West in discussing sex. His frank talk goes against the mainstream, and his comments raised many eyebrows among an audience that ranged from young men and women clad in jeans to people in their 80s. With little poll data available to judge the Soviet public's attitude toward sex, the audience's questions offer some clues Most expressed concern over a perceived rise in pornography and homosexuality. But <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> said he does not consider recent sexually explicit Soviet movies to be pornographic and told the audience that homosexuality is natural for some people. He noted that right-wingers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> once condemned sex education as `` a communist plot.'' But he said that sex education is desperately needed in this bastion of communism. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> blamed Soviet authorities for the public's ignorance about sex and the resulting health and family problems. `` If a woman comes into a clinic, even a solid one in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and asks how to become pregnant, they will tell her,'' <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> said in his lecture. `` But if she asks how to receive pleasure from this, they will say ` We ca n't help you, it's not our speciality.''' Traditionally, Soviet women are expected only to be good mothers and housewives. `` Sexual pleasure was considered not important to marriage,'' he said. Today, however, Soviet women are demanding happy sex lives. There have been some changes, however. This year, after a 10-year struggle with censors, <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s book `` Introduction to Sexology'' was finally published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A new book, which he says will include illustrations of sexual positions, is slated for publication early next year. Sex clinics have been opened in several Soviet cities and the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is beginning to realize that AIDS, the high rates of divorce and abortions can not be reduced without the help of psychologists and sociologists, <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> said. This year, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Meditsinskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> decried a chronic shortage of condoms and printed a reader's letter saying some people were so desperate they were using balloons as a substitute. The same newspaper called for repeal of the law making homosexuality a crime. Although <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s talk was largely philosophical and he did not provide many specific sex tips, one woman confided to a friend afterward: `` If I had known this before, I'd be a normal person now.''

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in one of his last official acts, will undertake an international effort next week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to roll back the proliferation of chemical weapons technology. He will represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a multinational conference in the French capital that is expected to reaffirm a 1925 protocol banning the use of chemical weapons and to encourage completion of negotiations among 40 nations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> of a new agreement prohibiting production. Some 20 nations, by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimate, either have produced chemical weapons or are capable of manufacturing them. Among them the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> includes <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, whose leader, <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, is accused by the department of supporting terrorism. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> `` is one of the more recent ones, and one of the more irresponsible ones'' to reach the edge of production, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. At one time, the civilized world abhorred poison gas. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> discovered in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war that chemical weapons were effective against numerically superior Iranian forces. And some Third World countries resent interference with their chemical industries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stopped production in 1969, then resumed 17 years later on the grounds the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other potential adversaries had chemical weapons programs. Currently, chemical components and artillery shells to contain them are being produced but stockpiled separately. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last September. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during the election campaign in October that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take the lead in making sure that nations using chemical and biological weapons are punished. `` The barriers against chemical warfare, breached as we've seen during the Iran-Iraq war, must be repaired and raised even higher,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to make nations that use such weapons `` pay a price.'' Realistically, though, the 1925 protocol, to which 130 nations are parties, has no enforcement provisions. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which denied using the weapons, is one of them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a global ban in 1984 while twice casting tie-breaking votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to continue financing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production. An aide explained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt that as long as the Soviets produced chemical weapons the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should keep up. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemical weapons, then claimed to have ceased production. A foreign ministry spokesman said 50,000 tons would be stored, the rest destroyed. Officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to plan ways to restrict proliferation. So far, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the only two countries in the world to admit possessing chemical weapons. But in recent weeks the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has accused <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of having a chemical weapons plant. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a recent television interview, said the government has not ruled out a military strike against the plant. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference is expected to reaffirm the 1925 ban on using the weapons and to urge adoption of a verifiable ban on production, as well, by the 40-nation disarmament conference that meets in February in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Two other steps may be taken in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>: authorizing the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to investigate allegations of the use of chemical weapons, and some form of assistance for victims. Nearly all the 159 nations that are members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> are sending their foreign ministers or ambassadors to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` You can expect an enormous turnout,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who is involved in preparations for the Jan. 7-11 conference. Whatever declaration emerges, there is no way to enforce it, although sanctions may be discussed. And, the official said, `` there is a great allergy, particularly in the Arab world, to pointing fingers at their capabilities and their emerging capabilities. So that becomes a bit sensitive.'' Assuming the 40 nations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, which do not include <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, decide to ban the production and possession of chemical weapons, there still will be an enormous problem. `` We recognize that verification is a very complicated problem,'' the official said. `` When you are talking about not producing chemical agents, that raises all kinds of very difficult issues. Any chemical industry which can produce pesticides to kill insects can probably produce chemical agents to kill people. And that's one of the frightening parts of this whole business. They are relatively simple to construct and to make.''

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s restructuring drive eventually may enable Soviet computer makers to satisfy demand, but progress will be slow and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> can be expected to keep trying to acquire Western technology, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific advisory panel says It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should take a more focused and flexible approach to export controls on computers, especially since the existing curbs on many components and systems have become virtually unenforceable. The panel urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to concentrate instead on striving _ together with its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ to control leakage to the Soviet bloc of militarily valuable supercomputers and the most advanced computer manufacturing processes. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not afford to be complacent about its computer technology strengths or base export control decisions on an assumption of an invincible lead,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report released Thursday. Preparing the 288-page study was a 17-member committee chaired by <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, professor of management information systems and policy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is the principal operating agency of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and Engineering. The report estimated that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lags about five years to 10 years behind the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in many computer technologies. `` The lag between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is now large enough that the acquisition-diversion of certain Western technologies for direct production will help the Soviets tremendously,'' it said. Referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika or restructuring drive, the report said that `` if perestroika actually fails to bring about fundamental changes in the Soviet economy, collection efforts will surely increase. `` On the other hand, if perestroika succeeds, the Soviet computing industry may finally find itself in a position to fully meet demand, and the Soviet military may find itself getting the same kind of support from its own computing industry that it now must get by using the Western computer industry as a surrogate,'' it said. But the report added that `` the full effects of perestroika will be a long time coming, and transformation of the Soviet computer industry can not happen overnight. In the meantime, the acquisition of Western technology would seem to appear even more attractive to the Soviet computer industry as it tries to close the gap.'' On <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export controls policy, it noted that `` as the computer market becomes increasingly global, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms face increasing foreign competition, mostly from firms operating with fewer export barriers under the same CoCom guidelines.'' <ORGANIZATION> CoCom </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION>, comprising the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries except <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. `` Tighter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> controls may reflect the absence of a fully effective multilateral control effort, but there is a risk that in the computer area, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may lock the proverbial barn door after the horse has escaped,'' the report said. It concluded that `` current technological progress will make controls harder to enforce, and technological and market developments combine to make a case for a more focused and flexible control process.'' Increasingly powerful computer hardware and software, the study said, are in effect becoming commodities in world trade. `` Commodity products are available in high volume and at low cost, they may be available in multiple and substitutable forms, and they tend to be small and easy to transport,'' it said. `` These attributes make commodities vital to the economic health of the computer industry, but also effectively uncontrollable.'' The report recommended that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> publish a list of computer technologies that are commodities. The government then should promulgate a policy exempting such commodities from export controls, at least for trade among CoCom nations. On the other hand, it said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should work with other agencies to focus export control efforts on `` computer technologies of compelling military importance'' that could enable Soviet bloc countries to make substantial gains in their technology base. In particular, the report cited advanced chip fabrication lines, supercomputers and other high-performance computing systems, computer-aided design systems, and magnetic and magneto-optical materials. The study also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should involve newly industrializing countries such as <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> into the CoCom program.

 You can call him <PERSON> Shree </PERSON>. And you can call him <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s former self-styled guru of wealth and free love, <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shree </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, says until further notice that you do n't need to call him God. <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> announced Thursday he has dropped the honorific title of <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON>, a Hindi word meaning God. Many Indians resented <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> calling himself <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON> because, in <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, no mortal is equal to God. `` I have been calling myself ` <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON>' just as a challenge to this country,'' the 57-year-old who once taught philosophy in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said in the statement from his new commune in <LOCATION> Poona </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to be called ` <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON>.' Enough is enough. The joke is over,'' he said. <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> was deported three years ago from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after he pleaded guilty to immigration fraud and closed his 64,000-acre commune of <LOCATION> Rajneeshpuram </LOCATION> in central Oregon. Followers had bestowed dozens of Rolls Royces on their revered guide of Eastern religion, pop psychology and free love. After roaming in search of a new sanctuary for a claimed 500,000 faithful worldwide, he moved his cult to a six-acre commune in <LOCATION> Poona </LOCATION>, a city of nearly 1 million residents about 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. But despite Thursday's announcement, the guru did not entirely renounce claims to divinity. He told 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Poona </LOCATION>, `` From today onwards, you can look at me as ` Gautama the Buddha.' And by accepting <PERSON> Gautama </PERSON> the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> as my very soul, I go out of the Hindu fold completely.'' <PERSON> Gautama </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> about 500 B.C., renounced a title too. Born a prince, he gave up nobility to launch a new religion _ Buddhism.

 While a nearly all-male club is making its annual New Year's Eve trek up 14,110-foot <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s Peak, a group of women will be making a 1,000-foot ascent of a nearby mountain in jest of the traditional event. This year's climb will mark the 66th annual climb of <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s Peak by the AdAmAn club, which plans to set off fireworks at the summit. The group adds a climber each year. AdaWoman, a band founded in 1982, will make an ascent on Pyramid Mountain in Ute Pass west of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, light sparklers, play <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON>'s song `` I Am Woman,'' down champagne and head home for the night, organizers said. It will be the seventh climb for the AdaWoman club, which was founded almost as a lark by <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> and several other woman who train on Pyramid Mountain. `` It's really beautiful up there, and one morning we had run the mountain and decided this was the way we should start out the new year together,'' she said. The women also were prodded that year because AdAmAn, for the first time in its history, was inviting a female guest, veteran climber <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` One of the AdAmAn members said that the reason they had n't done it before was they did n't know any women who could make it,'' said <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>. `` Well, I and another of our members ran the <ORGANIZATION> Pikes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION>, so I think we can make it.'' AdAmAn historian <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, still the only woman invited, will make her fourth climb with the club this year. `` Of course, when we started this climb in 1922, you could n't have hired a woman to go with us It was n't until a few years ago that women got so they were into this type of thing,'' he said. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said AdaWoman may add a man in 50 or 60 years, if one is found worthy.

 More Americans are once again calling the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> their home, but <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> remain the favored places to settle down, government figures show. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday released its 1988 population estimates, showing that the West and parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> continued strong population growth, while smaller growth rates were reflected in the Northeast. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> appeared to be rebounding after a dropoff in population during the early part of the decade. The total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population stood at 245.8 million as of July 1, the date of the 1988 Census statistics, reflecting a 3 percent increase in population from July 1, 1985. Over the three-year period, the biggest growth rate and population loss were seen in small population states: <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was up 12.8 percent, topping the 1 million mark for the first time; and the energy-producing state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> had a 7.6 percent decline, a loss of 39,000 people, leaving its population at 471,000. The 12 Midwestern states _ where the depressed farm economy caused a population downturn between 1981 and 1983 _ had an overall 1.2 percent population increase in the 1985-88 period, the Census estimates showed. Some Midwestern states continued to lose residents, but the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as a region picked up slightly. Losses were estimated in 1985-1988 for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement, but added, `` The 1988 data indicate that the declines may be slowing, and several of these states may have grown in the past year.'' The largest state, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, had the greatest increase in population, 1.8 million people, or 6.9 percent, boosting its total to 28.2 million. Other states that showed strong growth rates over the three years were: <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 9.6 percent, bringing its total to 3.5 million people; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, 9.9 percent, to 1.1 million residents; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 8.9 percent, to 12.4 million people; <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, 7.1 percent, to 6.4 million; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, 5.7 percent, to 4.6 million; and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, 5.4 percent, to 660,000 people. Eleven states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> lost population during the three years: <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. In the regions outside the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the government found that population increased by 1.5 percent in the Northeast, including the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states; by 3.7 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>; and by 5.5 percent in the West, including the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, continued to attract residents, with a population growth rate of 8.9 percent. That boosted its population to 12.4 million.

<HEAD>Provincial Court Bans `Falcon Crest' Show As Immoral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A provincial court has ordered the television series <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crest </ORGANIZATION> off Egyptian TV on grounds it undermines public morals, according to a newspaper report. Falcon Crest began appearing several years ago on local television and quickly became a favorite among both poor and wealthy Egyptians, despite its depiction of a society generally foreign to the mostly conservative Egyptians. Television censors, for example, routinely cut kissing scenes from <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> that they consider too passionate. The TV series <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crest </ORGANIZATION>, also was widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of parliament complained it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian youth. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Wafd </ORGANIZATION>, published by a centrist opposition party of the same name, said Thursday the ruling banning the show was in a provincial court in the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Shibin </LOCATION> el-Kom. In the case, brought by a lawyer identified as <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, he was quoted as arguing that scenes in <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> are `` against morality and the constitution and incite debauchery,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wafd </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said that in finding for the plaintiff, Chief Judge <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> also ordered Information Minister <PERSON> Safwat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON>, in charge of state television and radio, to pay court costs. A spokesman for <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON> said Thursday that he knew nothing about the case. The director of Egyptian television's Channel 2, which airs the series, was not available for comment, but her secretary, <PERSON> Wafaa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON>, said she had n't heard about the case either. `` We will be showing two more episodes next Sunday,'' she said.

 Move over, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Make way, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Drugs have caught another sports star, this one named after a pub and owned by the heir to the British throne. Devil's Elbow, a 4-year-old gelding, tested positive for three stimulants after giving <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> his first winner as a race-horse owner in a $ 1,200 steeplechase at <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>. In announcing the finding this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which governs horse racing in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said there were no indications the prince had anything to do with the doping and in all likelihood would not be punished. Suspicions were that the drugs were contained in contaminated feed. But trainer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaselee </PERSON> faces an $ 1,800 fine, and Devil's Elbow, the namesake of a pub in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, that also is owned by the prince, could be stripped of the victory if further tests showed the horse was deliberately doped. The Royal Family's longstanding love affair with horses and racing was for the first time touched by the spreading stain of drugs in sports, which have claimed such stars as <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the Olympic 100-meter runner from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the all-pro linebacker from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am not aware of any other royal horse being disqualified for this sort of reason,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studs </ORGANIZATION>, the Royal Family's horse-breeding farm. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, whose career as a steeplechase jockey ended several years ago in a series of spills, was not commenting on the drug findings. The tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified friend of the prince as saying <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was `` highly embarrassed'' by the case. `` The whole business is most upsetting for him _ it'll take some living down,'' the friend was quoted as saying. Most of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s dozen national newspapers played the story on the front page Thursday with the kind of headlines usually reserved for sex scandals and ax murders. `` Charlie's Nag Fails Dope Test,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Charles Horse In Dope Shock,'' said the Daily Mail. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, using <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' formal position in the royal household, headlined its front-page story: `` Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>' First Winner Fails a Dope Test.'' Like other sports, British horse racing has had trouble recently with drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said that of an estimated 6,500 samples per year, 10-20 test positive, usually for legitimate medication administered too close to race day. Two days after Devil's Elbow won the Novice Stakes at <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> Dec. 5, the <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> leveled a record $ 31,500 fine against trainer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsworth </PERSON> after one of his horses tested positive for steroids. Steroids are muscle-builders and their use got <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> thrown out of the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Drug use in horse racing in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where no medication is allowed in race entrants, more often involves pain-killers or stimulants, such as the caffeine, theobromine and theophylline found in Devil's Elbow. <PERSON> Gaselee </PERSON> said feed from his barn had been taken away for tests and the <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that processed food, known as `` horse nuts,'' was undergoing tests, which could take up to two weeks. Nevertheless, the club said, <PERSON> Gaselee </PERSON> remained in line for punishment. `` I make it quite clear that if any substance is found in a horse, which might have impaired or improved its running, the trainer will be held responsible,'' <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairhaven </LOCATION>, the club's senior steward, said Added <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> spokesman: `` I do not know what sort of diet this horse was on. But stimulants are not permitted.'' On Wednesday, as the positive test of Devil's Elbow was being announced, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s big race of the day was the Arkle Challenge Trophy at <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>. The winner? A horse named Positive.

If a violation actually occurs, the bond could be forfeited and the person could be jailed for up to six months.

 The country's nuclear power plants reported 2,940 mishaps in 1987, a slight increase from the year before, according to an anti-nuclear organization. A report Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> said the accident figure represented incidents reported by nuclear plant owners to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and classified by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> as `` potentially significant safety events.'' The corresponding figure was 2,836 accidents in 1986, when there were 99 reactors in operation. The number of operating reactors grew to 109 in 1987, according to the report. Public Citizen, a non-profit research organization and longtime critic of nuclear power, also said Thursday that in 1987 there was a record number of more than 104,000 incidents in which nuclear workers were exposed to measurable doses of radiation. In addition, it said there were at least 430 emergency shutdowns last year and at least 492 violations of nuclear plant safety rules. The report was based on <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> data compiled and analyzed by Public Citizen. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, said in releasing the report: `` Public attention has recently been focused on the poor safety conditions at the nation's nuclear weapons reactors. `` However, in 1987, badly managed commercial nuclear plants daily threatened the safety of the public, particularly the 96 million Americans who live within 50 miles of a reactor,'' she said. Public Citizen criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> for refusing to release key safety data such as `` single-component failure'' records and a comprehensive listing of all emergency plant shutdowns. It contended that the commission's public records on safety violations are incomplete and contradictory. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he could not comment in detail on specific allegations without first having a chance to examine the Public Citizen report. `` I would say that in general the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> makes data available to the public on all safety issues,'' he said. <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> added that based on a variety of safety and operational criteria, `` the overall performance at nuclear plants, we think, is improving.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, a nuclear industry group, said in response to the Public Citizen report: `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear plants have just ended a record-breaking year, producing 20 percent of the nation's electricity `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> confirm that, year by year, nuclear plants have improved their availability and reduced the number of significant events, which are an important measure of safe operation,'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. Here are key findings of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> report: _ In 1987 a total of 430 `` scrams'' or emergency plant shutdowns were reported to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> This worked out to an average of 4.4 shutdowns per operating reactor. Plants experiencing the largest number of scrams during the year were Vogtle-1, <LOCATION> Waynesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, 27 shutdowns; <PERSON> Shearon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris-1 </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Newhill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 21 shutdowns, and Beaver Valley-2, <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 17 shutdowns. _ There were at least 2,940 mishaps at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power reactors in 1987 That was the tally of `` licensee event reports'' submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> by utilities. According to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, they provide descriptions of `` potentially significant safety events'' that `` might lead to serious accidents.'' Reactors with the highest number of mishaps were Nine Mile Point-2, <LOCATION> Scriba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, 79 mishaps; Perry-1, <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 77 mishaps, and Vogtle-1, 75 mishaps. _ In 1987 an all-time high of 104,458 incidents occurred in which workers at nuclear reactors received measurable doses of radiation _ At least 492 violations of safety regulations at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power reactors were cited by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 `` Inasmuch as <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s data are incomplete, the actual number is probably significantly higher,'' the Public Citizen report said. Plants at which the highest numbers of violations were reported include Sequoyah-1 and 2, Daisy, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, 37 violations; <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry-1, 2 and 3, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, 35 violations, and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Point-3 and 4, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, 33 violations.

 It's not <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. It's not even Plains. But the rural crossroads of <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>, which consists of little more than a country store with gas pumps, took on the look of a presidential retreat when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived with his fishing tackle. The president-elect, accompanied by a 17-vehicle entourage of security and press, stopped by Thursday to fish for bass at <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s 55-acre private lake in <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>'s partly rolling, partly swampy terrain 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. `` I have n't seen so much excitement since the milk truck turned over a couple of years ago,'' said area resident <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. `` What Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> have been to other presidents, we hope <PERSON> Pintlala </PERSON> will be for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' joked the Rev. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Pintlala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, who gathered with a dozen other people to welcome <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A few dozen more collected outside <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s guarded gate Thursday evening when the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caravan pulled out. `` Thank you all very much,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking through an amplified car speaker. `` Happy New Year to everybody.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> political ally and a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> native who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, arranged the afternoon of fishing in the former Creek Indian settlement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caught nine fish by day's end. The largest weighed three pounds, and he threw them all back. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played a joke on the press, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holding up a huge bass as cameras rolled. The fish was actually a mounted trophy from <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s home. The welcoming group, with one little girl holding high a sign that read `` Good Fishing,'' cheered as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived. The group then went to <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>'s service station, which serves as a grocery, hot dog stand and unofficial city hall for <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>. At <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>'s, a few dozen other people had gathered, thinking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would pass by the junction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 31 and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION>, which amounts to `` downtown Pintlala.'' But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> motorcade took a faster route on Interstate 65, turning into the Scott farm from another local road. <PERSON> Pintlala </PERSON>'s population is `` less than a thousand, not counting the deer and quail,'' said Constable <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON>. `` Use the word ` quail' advisedly,'' warned the Rev. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>.

 With 36.5 miles of shelves and more than 1.1 million different books, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON> thinks his bookstore offers the largest collection of titles for sale in the world. He hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> will think so, too. <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON>, 49, says he's writing the editors of the Guinness Book once he has gathered supporting evidence. And there's quite a bit of it. Four warehouses, packed with books from floor to ceiling, house <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON>'s volumes, arranged alphabetically by categories. The complex is so large that, until recently, his 49-year-old wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, used roller skates to retrieve customer requests. Guinness lists <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as the bookstore with the most shelving at 30 miles, while <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Noble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bookstore </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is listed as the largest book building with 154,250 square feet of books, said <PERSON> Sheelagh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a deputy editor for Guinness in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON> said he has 78,000 square feet of books, and more titles than any other store because he has few duplicate books, textbooks or remainders such as those sold at <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Noble and <LOCATION> Foyle </LOCATION>. Bibliophiles from as far way as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> visit his store regularly, he said. But if you want to learn how to ski or groom your pet, do n't go to <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON>'s. `` We do n't have too many -LRB- books -RRB- for the casual reader,'' <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON> said recently. `` Mostly our books are for the scholar and most are sold by mail order. We are not too concerned with what is being published now.'' Fewer than 2 percent of <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON>'s tomes were published after 1960, he said. Some of the biggest categories are literary criticism, anthropology, philosophy, theology and history. Zubal estimated he has 250 books alone about <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> and 1,000 on <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. `` We do a lot of business in World War II books,'' said <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON>. `` We think there are about 6,000 books published on World War II, and we have 3,000.'' Zubal acquires most of his books from contacts who tell him of literary estates or bookstores for sale. `` I used to hit the flea market circuit but now I let the younger guys do it,'' said the bookseller, who travels to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> several times a year to buy and sell. <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON> also owns autographed editions by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and flying ace <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickenbacker </PERSON>. While <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON> said all his books are for sale, `` there are books I mark up to scare off the fainthearted.'' He was not ready to dicker over an autographed edition of `` Finnegan's Wake'' priced at $ 3,000. `` I'm in no hurry to sell it,'' he said. `` It's money in the bank.'' Once <PERSON> Zubal </PERSON> submits his claim to <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, he will need to submit two forms from witnesses validating his claim and a color photograph. Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said editors would have to determine if his claim to have the most individual titles would merit a separate record category. `` That is always a possibility, but we ca n't make any promises,'' she said.

<HEAD>Government Foresees Another Good Year for U.S. Industry in 1989</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, helped by continued strong demand for exports, will enjoy a seventh consecutive year of rising sales in 1989, with high-technology businesses leading the gains, according to government forecasts. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday released the 30th edition of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Industrial Outlook, which each year picks the winners and losers among American businesses based on detailed analyses of market trends in 350 different manufacturing and service industries. `` Totaling up all the individual forecasts, you can see that we are looking for another positive year for the economy,'' Deputy <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said. `` Services will continue to be strong, and the majority of manufacturing industries will continue to grow, especially those producing capital equipment and exports,'' she said at a news conference where she previewed the 566-page book. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said more than 70 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing industries were expected to see higher sales in the new year, with the median growth rate, after adjusting for inflation, projected to be 2.3 percent. Those projections represented a slight drop from the current year, reflecting the belief that the non-farm economy, while not in danger of a recession, will not do quite as well in 1989, <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said. Among the report's forecasts: _ Some sectors of manufacturing will be held back by a continuing slump in the construction industry, which will depress the demand for steel and other building materials _ Industries providing services instead of goods, the fastest growing portion of the economy, will continue to do well in 1989, led by firms specializing in computers _ Aerospace, one of the largest manufacturing industries, will show modest overall growth as rising demand for civilian aircraft is offset by a drop in military orders _ Car sales will decline by about 1 percent to 10.6 million units, with the share of sales held by manufacturers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding steady at about 72 percent _ The banking industry, despite continued problems with international debts and stiff competition from non-banking financial companies, will show good growth, with assets rising by about 7 percent _ Airlines will have another strong year, with revenues rising by more than 14 percent Trucking revenues will rise 7 percent, while revenues earned by railroads will increase 2 percent. _ Health and medical services, one of the fastest growing service industries, will show a sharp 10.7 percent rise in 1989 to an estimated $ 618 billion The report said the service category with the biggest projected percentage increase will be space commercialization, where revenues are expected to rise by 50 percent to $ 2.7 billion as the commercial launch industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> begins its first year of operation. Other service standouts will be in the fields of data processing, computer services and electronic data bases, with revenues projected to rise by between 13 percent and 20 percent. In the manufacturing sector, the star performer is expected to be the metal-cutting segment of the machine tool industry, with shipments projected to rise by 13.9 percent. That reflects the boom in capital investment as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry rushes to expand production facilities to meet rising export demands. The No. 2 manufacturing industry will be semiconductors, with a projected 13.4 percent rise in shipments; followed by a 13 percent increase in paper making machinery. Paper plants are now operating at 95 percent of capacity and are trying to expand to meet the high level of demand. Many of the manufacturing sectors expected to perform the most sluggishly were tied to the construction industry. Sales of chemical preparation were projected to drop by 14.6 percent, the largest overall decrease. Sales of household cooking equipment were forecast to decline by 7.9 percent, reflecting an expected decline in construction of new homes next year. Demand for steel products are forecast to fall by 6.9 percent in 1989, reflecting a drop in demand for steel girders in construction. The Industrial Outlook can be purchased for $ 24 beginning next month at the government's 21 regional bookstores.

 A bomb exploded in a crowded neighborhood in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state today as police tried to defuse the device, killing at least five people and injuring 20, authorities said. The dead included a police inspector and two constables working to detach the bomb, which had been placed in a tin box and attached to a bicycle parked in a central <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> neighborhood, authorities said. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred at 7:30 a.m. But police said they suspected Sikh militants waging a 6-year guerrilla war against <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu majority for a separate homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a prosperous farming state bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. According to a police spokesman, an anonymous caller warned authorities of the bomb.

Two men, a Sikh and a Hindu, also died. Twenty others, including several children on their way to school, were injured, the spokesman said. At least 10 were in serious condition, he said. Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, but they are a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Hindus comprise more than 80 percent of the country's population. Sikh militants, claiming discrimination by the Hindu community, have been demanding an independent nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982.

<HEAD>Most Farmers Met Contracts Despite Drought, USDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The summer's devastating drought caused relatively few farmers to renege on contracts for advance sales of corn, soybeans and wheat, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a survey of 325 elevators, or warehouses, in 13 Corn Belt and spring wheat states showed farmers would default on less than 1 percent of their contracts. `` Only about 1 percent of these elevators expected that losses from farmers failing to meet contract commitments would exceed 10 percent of the elevator's net worth,'' the report said. The report was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in this year's Disaster Assistance Act, which provided aid to farmers hit by the drought and hot weather during the spring and early summer months. Drought raised commodity prices sharply and left many farmers with less grain and soybeans to deliver than they had counted on when they entered into forward contracts early in the year. `` Many would have liked to get out of their contracts, if that were possible, because market prices rose above the contracted prices,'' the report said. `` Some farmers produced less than they had sold forward and faced buying out their contracts at a loss.'' If farmers defaulted, that would leave elevators or other buyers to absorb the losses. The report was sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> but has not been distributed generally by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. A copy was made available Thursday to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the information was based on a telephone survey of the 325 elevators in September. The report said the survey results also were consistent with information obtained in field interviews of elevator managers, telephone interviews of bankers and brokers, and from state grain marketing specialists. `` Severe drought and the associated grain and soybean price increases hit farmers who priced forward in two ways,'' the report said. `` Those who hedged by selling futures were the first to be affected. To meet margin calls during the period when prices increased, these farmers had to either tap financial reserves or obtain increased credit.'' But the study found in a `` small-scale survey of commodity brokers and bankers'' that farmers and their brokers and bankers successfully weathered the sharp commodity price increases and the resulting calls for greater margins, or deposits, that occurred in June and July. `` For farmers who entered into cash forward contracts, the financial problem hit when it became necessary to buy back contracts in lieu of making delivery,'' the report said. More than half of the elevators surveyed had forward contracts with farmers for corn, soybeans or wheat produced in 1988. The contracts covered about 15 percent of the corn, 22 percent of the soybeans and 7 percent of the spring wheat that these elevators bought this year. According to the survey, the elevators indicated that more than 95 percent of their outstanding forward contracts with farmers likely would be fulfilled as originally negotiated, with between 1 percent and 2 percent renegotiated, and less than 1 percent in default. The remainder were uncertain. Officials had expected higher rates of default and renogotiation, but the report said many farmers realized the possible intensity of the drought by early June and curtailed normal contracting activity. `` As a result, farmers incurred fewer contract obligations than they might have incurred if the drought had not become apparent until later in the season,'' the report said. Weather also was important during that period, the report said. Many areas, particularly in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, received rain in late July and early August, which improved yield prospects in those areas. In those cases, improved yields helped farmers meet contract obligations, compared with the uncertainties of only a few weeks earlier. The 13 states included an eastern Corn Belt region of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and a western Corn Belt region of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Experts Say Armenian Nuclear Plant Must be Reinforced or Shut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> should be strengthened against earthquakes as quickly as possible or closed, experts were quoted as saying in an official report. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday that specialists hurried to inspect the plant near <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, after the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed thousands of people. They concluded that the plant was not damaged but needed reinforcement against earthquakes `` within the shortest possible time'' or it should be closed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The report follows an announcement by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear power officials last week that six nuclear power projects were scrapped because of earthquake danger or because of tougher standards. New rules were imposed after the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster in April 1986 killed at least 31 people. Speculation abounded after the earthquake earlier this month that the plant near <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> was damaged. The facility lies near a geological fault. Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Dec. 12 that the plant would be shut in two years. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> story, quoting <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, mentioned no deadline.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is pledging an all-out effort to bring those responsible for the `` savage and tragic'' bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 to justice. `` What we want to do is find out who did it and bring them to justice,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement Thursday before flying here from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to continue a two-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation. When they arrived in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, the president and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were greeted by the mayor of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, entertainer <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, and his wife. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will be guests until Monday at the palatial desert home of publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> in nearby <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirage </LOCATION>, continuing their custom of attending a New Year's party there. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> then plan to return to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to spend a few more days in the Bel Air residence that will be their home after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends on Jan. 20. They are scheduled to fly back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jan. 5 for their final two weeks in the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> airport was his first since British authorities announced more than 24 hours earlier that they had determined the crash was caused by a bomb. The crash killed 259 people in the air _ mostly Americans _ and 11 on the ground. `` I think you all know that I have been following quite closely the details of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 tragedy, and now that we know definitely that it was a bomb, we're going to make every effort we can to find out who is guilty of this savage and tragic thing and bring them to justice,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, echoing comments made by officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` is studying and making recommendations as to additional things we can do at airports to provide security for those who travel.'' Asked whether he thought the bombing was the work of terrorists, the president said, `` I ca n't comment on that. It seems to savor of that, but we're going to have to have more details, and we're doing everything we can to find them and working in connection with other countries on that.'' British investigators announced in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Wednesday they have `` conclusive evidence'' that a bomb, not structural failure, caused the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> jumbo </ORGANIZATION> jet to break up Dec. 21 over southwestern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Finally, Christmas Trees Are Back As Attitudes Soften Toward
Religion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Christmas trees have reappeared in homes and social clubs after a long absence, the latest sign of a softening in the attitude of the officially atheist government toward the Roman Catholic church. `` I considered it a tradition that could n't be erased,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliva </PERSON>, who teaches religion at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> and also edits a newsletter on church issues. At a social club, a pine tree adorned with Christmas lights sits a few feet from the statue of one of the martyrs of the Cuban Revolution. But the great majority of the Christmas trees are found in private homes and occupy an out-of-the-way place invisible to passers-by. This Pennsylvania-sized nation of 10 million people, the least religious of any in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, branded Yuletide celebrations as a `` bourgeois prejudice'' after the 1959 Communist takeover, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. One reason: The government felt the manpower needed for the winter sugar harvest should not be diverted by holiday celebrations. That problem has become less acute with mechanization. Last year, several Cubans displayed a Christmas tree, and the old tradition picked up considerable momentum this year. Putting up a Christmas tree can be a chore since none is sold commercially and often they must be dug up from wooded areas, no small task in a country with few private cars. In addition, ornaments generally are available only if they were stashed away _ and not discarded _ when the government began discouraging Christmas observances. Several Cubans said Christmas always had been considered more of an occasion for family gatherings and gift-giving than a religious festival. Still, even the limited Yuletide observation is a far cry from a few years ago, when the only acknowledgement of the holiday were the signs in stores reserved for foreigners: `` December is gift-buying month.'' This was a subtle attempt by the government to earn dollars by getting foreign visitors to buy Christmas presents in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> authorities have become much more accommodating attitude toward the church as part of an effort to improve the country's image abroad As an example, he said the government has allowed 30 new priests to immigrate to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> this year, the largest number since the revolution. President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also said there will be no limit on the number of foreign nuns allowed to immigrate. In addition, there have been hints the government is negotiating with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> for his first visit to the island. But the more flexible government attitude toward the church has not always been met by reciprocal gestures from church leaders. Six weeks ago, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cespedes </PERSON>, the general vicar of the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>, expressed concern about the `` falsity, deceit, apathy, and dishonesty'' that permeate social life in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. There is no disputing, however, the more relaxed government stance toward the church. In the early 1960s, for example, the government looked on the church as a hotbed of anti-revolutionary sentiment and expelled 600 of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 800 priests. Students were taught atheism and only in 1979 was religion made a part of the university teachings. Now, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said, `` the campaign to instill with atheism has diminished. There is more flexibility.''

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, back home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a hunting and fishing vacation, said he was `` fairly close'' to making his two remaining Cabinet-level appointments and ready to focus on his first 100 days in the Oval Office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended a four-day vacation Thursday with a successful bass fishing outing on a private lake in <LOCATION> Pintlala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. He caught nine fish, the largest a three-pounder. Today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was having a private meeting with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nominated as the new ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to meet with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, a job <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once held. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` fairly close'' to naming his energy secretary and his drug czar, the only two Cabinet-level posts still vacant in his new administration. According to sources, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who was energy secretary in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration and defense secretary in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations, was among a number of candidates <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was considering for the energy post. On Thursday in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, before heading to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters his top priorities were to `` finish the Cabinet, start fleshing out the secretary and undersecretary levels,'' and then start making `` definitive plans for the first 100 days'' of his new administration, which begins after his Jan. 20 inauguration. Before he left <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>, where he hunted quail on a friend's ranch for three days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened retaliation, if possible, against those who planted a bomb on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed Dec. 21 in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people on board <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did this, if you can ever find them.'' But the vice president refused to specify how he would retaliate, and he said it was unlikely terrorism could ever be stopped completely. `` It is almost impossible to guarantee there will never be another terrorism act,'' he said, though he suggested that improved intelligence and cooperation between nations would help. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his friend, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, founder of Bassmasters, each caught nine bass in four hours of fishing, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, has decided to take another short vacation before the inauguration: two days fishing in <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> about 75 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who did not have an exact schedule for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the fishing trip could take place over the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> holiday Jan. 16. This weekend <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, are going to the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Cacotin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, leaving on Friday and probably returning on Monday, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Navy Denies Eagleton Accusation Of Stonewalling On Base Closings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Base Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, denying an accusation by a member of a commission that compiled recommendations for military base closings, said it cooperated with the panel's review. In the recommendations issued Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lost six installations, three of which had not yet entered service, compared with five major bases lost by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 26 bases and 52 housing units that would be partially or wholly closed. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> who joined the 12-member commission part way through its seven-month review, said `` the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> stonewalled, and got away with it.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ultimately gave its cooperation. The Army begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said in an `` additional view'' at the close of the 88-page final report released by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Base Realignment and Closure. For the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` intransigence paid off. When the new secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of trimming the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, he should most certainly start with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ` refused to play' this time; it should be obliged to next time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>'s criticism `` We feel we did cooperate with the commission and clearly answered whatever questions the commission had,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>'s comment may be more a measure of the mood of the three services than their willingness to eliminate facilities, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. One Army officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>'s statement recalled the phrase `` the dumb, the devious and the defiant _ the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> being the dumb, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> devious and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> defiant.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers argued that unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, they eliminated many facilities employing thousands of people during the 1970s. Those facilities included the <LOCATION> Quonset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Glynco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Three of the six <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> facilities nominated by the commission for elimination were part of the home port program, and construction on them either had not started or was not complete. They included the Naval Station at Hunters Point, the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the Naval Station at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base to be eliminated, the Puget Sound Naval Station in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, is an administrative center 35 miles by automobile from another homeport, at <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The commission recommended moving administrative facilities from the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> to nearby <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where a homeport is under construction. The sixth <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> facility recommended for closure is the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, which the commission called `` unsafe and inadequate to support modern health care ... The hospital can not be modernized.'' None of the affected Army or <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases was critical, and most employees would be transferred, those services said. The Army stands to lose the most bases, including a major training center, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to be placed inactive status, affecting 3,140 military and 1,516 civilian employees. Also picked for closing were <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, with 1,319 military and 1,681 civilian employees; and the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> offices would close in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, with 2,140 military and 3,150 civilian employees. An Army spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, said he saw `` no unwarranted closures on the list.'' `` On first look, it seems that they have done their homework,'' he said. `` Sheridan, the Presidio and Dix have appeared on lists from time immemorial ... If we do n't need them, we should get rid of them.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, said that service `` fully supports the commission and its charter to bring about more efficient use of defense resources.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> maintains a military force of 607,000, said <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>. Of those, 15,743 would be relocated. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has a civilian work force of 264,348, of whom 5,086 would be affected. The commission recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> close five of its 94 major bases: <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Most of their functions would be taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Sheppard AFB in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, March AFB in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and Mountain Home AFB in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases affected, only <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> has strategic bombers, and the report said its B-52s are `` programmed to retire.'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> is one of six <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> bases. <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> is largely a training base. The F-4 tactical fighter wing at <PERSON> George </PERSON> is to be retired. FB-111 bombers located at <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> are being moved. The base is considered vulnerable to surprise attack from submarine-launched cruise missiles.

 A proposal that 34 major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases be closed brought warnings of economic woe from disheartened local officials and merchants, but there were sighs of relief around installations spared the ax or slated for expansion. `` I think it will be devastating _ 50 percent of our employment at least has to do with <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION>,'' Mayor <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> <PERSON> Podagrosi </PERSON> said in rural <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The training center, with 2,133 military and 1,035 civilian jobs, was one of the military bases recommended for closure in the report issued Thursday. But church bells pealed in <LOCATION> Enid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, when officials learned <ORGANIZATION> Vance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> was unaffected by the plan, and officers cheered at <ORGANIZATION> Myrtle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> when they learned it would stay open. `` Without question, we are very pleased,'' <PERSON> Enid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. In all, the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure recommended closing 86 facilities, including 52 military housing units, partially closing five others, and revising the roles and staffing levels at 54 others. If the plan is carried out, the commission estimated, the government would save $ 693 million annually and $ 5.6 billion over the next two decades. While 58,500 military and civilian employees would lose their jobs or be transferred, other bases would get 37,850 new jobs or assignments. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> stands to lose the city's third largest employer if the <ORGANIZATION> Presidio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base is closed as recommended. The base, one of the loveliest spots in the city, employs about 3,000 civilians and 2,700 military. `` For 112 years, the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> has been an integral part of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It was here before <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was a city. It's been a very good neighbor ... an important part of our economy,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>. Under the 1972 federal law that established the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, all but 36 of the Presidio's 1,490 acres would become part of the popular park, which includes coastal land both in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> north of the Golden Gate. `` -LRB- Closure -RRB- would be bad. We get a lot of business from the base. We would really feel it,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, manager of a Travelodge motel only a few yards from the Presidio's main gate. `` Nobody likes to see business go down the drain, and that's what's happening,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, owner of Il <PERSON> Forno </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzeria </PERSON>, across the street from the main gate of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> The base has about 2,000 civilian employees and 2,000 military employees, including about 1,000 full-time soldiers who direct 140,000 reservists from seven states. `` Nobody likes to lose their job,'' said <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghini </PERSON>, mayor of neighboring <LOCATION> Highwood </LOCATION> for the last two decades. `` But look ... the federal government has a job to do. It's time we put a stop to all this waste.'' The mood was somber in shops around <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The commission recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest basic training site be reduced to `` semiactive status'' and that its complement of 8,300 permanent military and civilian jobs be cut by more than 4,600. ` I am very worried,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziotas </PERSON>, as he leaned across the counter of the Palace Restaurant, which he has owned for 24 years. `` I'd have to close down, because 65 percent of my business comes from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>. I hope our politicians will be able to do something.'' But what was bad news for some communities was welcome news in others that will gain jobs as a result of the closures. In <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a naval base being built would receive fleets previously assigned to ports in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, which were recommended for abandonment. `` I'm glad to be off the hook,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, mayor of the community 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` Ingleside will move forward in the right direction.''

<HEAD>Satirical Sex-and-Politics Shows Pack Athens Theaters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Politics and sex, the mix that has rocked Greek theater for 2,400 years, is finding new life in satirical shows that mock Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and his relationship with a former flight attendant. Greeks are packing the capital's theaters to laugh at satires of the 69-year-old socialist premier, who is carrying on a public relationship with 34-year-old <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> while his governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is besieged by financial scandals. Public affairs _ sexual and political _ have been favorite topics for Greek comedians since the playwright <PERSON> Aristophanes </PERSON> made the combination a smash hit in the 5th century B.C. This year the writers did n't need much imagination. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s heart operation in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last September inspired the title of a popular revue, `` Post-Aorta <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>,'' written and directed by <PERSON> Lakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazopoulos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s top satirist. <PERSON> Lazopoulos </PERSON> asks innocently at each show: `` If a newcomer to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> saw <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would he think? `` That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street,'' comes the answer. Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> embracing advertises `` Little Dimitra's Sweetheart'', a take-off of a classic Greek folklore play, `` The Little Shepherdess's Sweetheart.'' In the show, an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> housewife is asked whether the premier's pre-election pledges of political and social change have been fulfilled `` <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> has made one change OK. He changed his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman for a Greek,'' she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic applause. Three months ago, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said he will divorce his 66-year-old American-born wife <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, but no proceedings have yet been started. The blonde Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> has been divorced twice. Six political revues are playing over the holiday season. According to box-office figures, the shows are grossing up to $ 37,500 a week, twice as much as the most successful drama in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The socialists banned censorship when they came to power in 1981, and the satirists say they're not afraid of libel prosecution _ even for the bawdiest jokes about <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>. `` I feel really free. If I could n't say the things I say I would suffocate,'' said <PERSON> Lazopoulos </PERSON>, 31, who was acquitted in 1987 on charges of slandering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s head of state, President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON>, in one show. `` Greeks have no other way to let steam off. If they could n't laugh at their problems, they would explode,'' <PERSON> Lazopoulos </PERSON> added According to critic <PERSON> Eleni </PERSON> <PERSON> Varopoulou </PERSON>, the current shows' mix of satirical sketches, monologues, songs and dance is styled after French revue and German cabaret. `` But the acidity of the satire is what characterizes the Greek revue,'' she said. Other favorite targets range from family relations to the inadequate public <PERSON> Varopoulou </PERSON> said the harsh Greek satire is n't aimed at making people think, but at soothing and relieving them `` so that by understanding their problem they exorcise it.'' The revues used to be staged like ancient comedy or modern musicals, with a glamorous chorus line and expensive costumes, but the trend is toward less glitz and more realism, <PERSON> Varopoulou </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lazopoulos </PERSON> says he prefers simple staging, but notes the Aristophanic tradition is still going strong. `` I find we have the same attitude against authority as <PERSON> Aristophanes </PERSON>. We can never match his writing but we can try to match him in not being afraid to criticize,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips Against Yen In Last Trading Day Of Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar slipped today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, ending the year's final trading day at 125.90 yen. After opening at 125.75 yen, down 0.28 yen from Thursday's closing, the dollar inched up but failed to regain its Thursday level It closed at 125.90 yen, down 0.13 yen, after ranging between 125.75 and 126.00 yen during the day. Dealers attributed the dollar's losses in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to its decline on overseas markets Thursday. A dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> described trading as `` very thin'' ahead of the three-day New Year's holiday starting Saturday. After beginning the year in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Jan. 4 at 120.45 yen, its lowest level since modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s, the dollar stayed mostly between 120 and 130 yen in the first half of the year. However, in the second half it fluctuated between the low-120 yen and mid-130 yen levels. After peaking at 136.75 yen on Sept. 2, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency began declining to a low closing of 120.88 yen on Nov. 25. Since then it has remained generally within the 120-126 yen range. Currency dealers said more stability is expected in exchange rates in 1989 unless President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes drastic changes in his economic policy from that of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` But unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> succeeds in trimming its twin deficits, the general tendency will be toward a weaker dollar against a stronger yen,'' said a dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> will reopen Jan. 4.

 Former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized in guarded condition with possible congestive heart failure or pneumonia, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who contends he is too ill to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment on racketeering charges, entered <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for the second time in three weeks. `` They -LRB- the attending physicians -RRB- have diagnosed him as a possible congestive heart failure or pneumonia,'' said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> nursing supervisor <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, was listed in guarded condition. A leading <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporter, said a priest administered the last rites to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, but a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman could not provide confirmation. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is `` very, very seriously ill,'' said the supporter, Friends of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> President <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON>. `` We are preparing a telegram to send to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asking them to let him -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- go home. That is his dying wish.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> said he did not know if a priest had administered the sacrament of the sick, formerly known as extreme unction. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was brought to the hospital by ambulance at 4:55 p.m., said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said he was with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> when he was taken to the hospital, but said he did not know why the decision was made to return <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. `` You'd better ask the doctors,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview earlier Thursday. `` All I know is he is in serious condition.'' He would not elaborate. However, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' private physician Dr. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON>, asked if his patient's condition was serious, replied, `` We do n't know yet.''

A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, on Oct. 21, on racketeering charges.

Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> later went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to plead innocent to the charges and is free on $ 5 million bail. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed he was too ill to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. His arraignment has been postponed indefinitely. The Marcoses fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986 following his ouster in a civilian-military revolt.

 Some of the 34 major military bases that would be closed under a federal commission's plan have served the military for decades and played a vital role in the country's defense over the years. They include: _ <ORGANIZATION> PRESIDIO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ARMY </ORGANIZATION> BASE _ Founded by the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> in 1776 on a hill now overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> has been a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base since 1846. The Presidio is now the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which controls <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> activities in 12 Western states. _ FORT <PERSON> SHERIDAN </PERSON> _ Located in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> is a graceful cluster of tan brick buildings that resembles a college campus. It opened in 1887, on 600 acres of land donated to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, who wanted federal troops nearby _ reportedly after a riot a year earlier. It is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Recruiting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> FORT </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DOUGLAS </LOCATION> _ The 119-acre Army installation was built east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes from Indians and keep an eye on Mormon settlers. It is a collection of parade grounds, barracks and other brick and whitewashed buildings, some dating from the 1920s and 1930s. _ <ORGANIZATION> BROOKLYN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAVY </ORGANIZATION> YARD _ The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighting ship was built in 1798 in what is now the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>. The government bought the yard in 1801 where it built vessels until the 1960s, employing as many as 70,000 people during World War II. Work on the Civil War ironclad Monitor was done there, and the battleships <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> were built there. The city eventually took over most of the yard. _ ARMY MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY _ The lab in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is the successor to the <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arsenal </LOCATION>, commissioned by President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> during the War of 1812. During its heyday, the arsenal was a major weapons maker, turning out cannons during the Civil War. The arsenal was closed in 1967, leaving the much smaller materials lab. _ <ORGANIZATION> PEASE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FORCE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BASE </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> opened in 1956 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and has been home of the <ORGANIZATION> 509th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bombardment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, whose predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> 509th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, dropped the bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mayor Barry Says He May Take Drug Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> admitted visiting an acquaintance suspected of drug involvement `` caused some embarrassment'' for the city but said he was innocent of wrongdoing and would be `` extra, extra careful'' to avoid appearances of impropriety in his personal life. The city's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, meanwhile, said Thursday that his office had decided to conduct a full investigation of the incident, in which the mayor visited a former city employee at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel just as police were preparing to attempt an undercover drug buy from the man. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in today's editions, quoted an unidentified source as saying the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> may join the federal investigation. Police have turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> results of an internal probe into why two detectives were stopped from attempting a drug buy from former city employee <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> after <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> turned up at <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room. The incidence occurred a week ago. Earlier this week, federal prosecutors had said only that they were reviewing what police investigators had found. But on Thursday, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said his office `` is conducting a full investigation of this entire matter.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, through spokesmen, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. On Thursday he called a news conference to answer questions `` around the controversy'' and he vigorously denied using or seeing drugs in the hotel room. `` I believe that one is innocent until proven guilty,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` But since last Thursday, I have been tried, convicted, sentenced and doing time, by some members of the media.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has acknowledged making several visits to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, whom he described as an acquaintance, but denied any involvement with drugs. Asked in a separate interview on <ORGANIZATION> WJLA-TV </ORGANIZATION> whether he would submit to a drug test, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> responded, `` I would do anything necessary to get this issue behind us.'' He said he would discuss it with his doctor `` and he'll tell me what to do.'' Asked if that meant he would take the drug test if his doctor approved, the mayor said he would, `` absolutely.'' However, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said earlier that no purpose would be served by such a test since `` he does n't do drugs.'' The police investigation, according to sources, was focused on whether <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was involved in any drug activity, why the mayor was in the hotel, and why the police officers did not search <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room until after he had checked out Friday morning Hotel employees, police sources said, initially had complained that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had offered drugs in return for sex. `` The public needs to know what happened,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` I still have demanded and call for a complete investigation and a complete disclosure of this report so this city can get on with its business.'' At the beginning of the news conference, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> promised to provide details on his relationship with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, but he revealed only that he met <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> when <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> worked for the district government. The mayor refused to answer reporters' questions after finishing his remarks. While city employees applauded <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> as he marched from the council chambers, others were not impressed with the mayor's comments `` He had an opportunity to talk to the nation, and he missed that opportunity,'' said <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. `` There were a lot of unanswered questions.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s latest controversy refocuses scrutiny on his personal life. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is married, acknowledged last year he once had a `` personal'' relationship with a convicted cocaine dealer, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. However, he denied buying cocaine from her or using drugs with her, and denied reports she had been paid hush money. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had been jailed on contempt charges three years earlier after refusing to testify before a grand jury. Officials say the case remains under investigation.

 Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an early and outspoken critic of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons plant, has died of complications from heart surgery. He was 59. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> died Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb, his son, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was forced to resign as <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health director in May 1981, following his publication of studies showing a higher incidence of cancer in areas of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> counties close to the Rocky Flats plant 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> sued numerous county officials over the firing. He received a $ 150,000 settlement in January 1985. `` They fired the messenger for the message,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, the attorney who represented <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the case. `` They killed off the community's public health director for proving that the community had a major illness. `` To me, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was truly a great man ... His death is a tragedy in that it's too early.'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` accomplished a great portion of his mission which was to revitalize the people's right to live in a safe setting.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s supporters said the government is now starting to acknowledge points he had been making for years. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> recently compiled a modernization report which calls for improvements to the nation's nuclear weapons facilities through the year 2010 According to a summary of the $ 250 billion <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan, <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>' recycling buildings would be upgraded between 1990 and 1997 to continue operating safely as the plant is gradually shut down and relocated. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> recently had been doing consulting work on the effects of nuclear radiation, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. He wrote and published articles, including a Dec. 18 column in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, headlined `` Rocky Flats: <ORGANIZATION> Death </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'' `` If the nation is to be properly protected, all studies of nuclear contamination and associated health effects should be conducted primarily by independent scientists who are insulated from cynical retaliation,'' he wrote. The Sims, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, native received his medical degree in 1965 from <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. He also held a master's degree in public health from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> He became <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health director in 1973. Following his resignation, he spent five years as a medical officer with the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, S.D. He recently returned to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. As controversy surrounding Rocky Flats built over the past four months, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> appeared and spoke at almost every public forum. He also served as a colonel in the medical corps of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> from 1970 until his death. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, and three sons.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wants to launch a peace initiative within two months and will seek <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s help in finding non-PLO Palestinian negotiators, an aide said today. Also today, the mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said he proposed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> pass a resolution calling for a truce to end the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising. `` I spoke about a U.N.-sponsored resolution like the one that stopped the Iran-Iraq war, and on condition that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ... releases all prisoners jailed on security charges and reopens universities,'' Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said in an interview. About 5,000 Palestinians are in jail, including about 1,600 held without trial under administrative detention. Five Palestinian universities and 16 two-year colleges are closed. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> made the proposal in a meeting with Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceaucescu </PERSON> two weeks ago. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said he asked that the proposal be passed to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has not yet responded. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>'s statement came as Palestinians debated the possibility of a conditional truce as a prelude to elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 1.7 million Palestinians live under Israeli military occupation. The debate is taking place in advance of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s expected unveiling of a plan for starting Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the premier hoped to start his peace initiative within two months _ about the time <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is expected to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. In an interview, <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was agreeable to talks being launched by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also envisioned a `` major role'' for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in helping find Palestinians that would be acceptable to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied reports that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would broker the process or that the superpowers would formally guide the negotiations. He said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> insisted on direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. `` If the two superpowers call on neighbors to negotiate that's all right but the talks would be direct talks,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said The <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Thursday the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan proposes an unofficial understanding that Palestinian negotiators be chosen or appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> but not belong to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> institutions or have a terrorist past. Officials have declined comment on the report. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said choosing Palestinians was the `` internal business'' of the Arab side. `` We only insist that there should be no <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> people or people identified with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, was summoned to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and met Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> today amid reports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was planning to present new proposals to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> soon. Both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, and his political rival <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have hinted that their coalition government will propose holding <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> elections as part of a peace package. As a condition for any such concessions, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> insist that Palestinians end the violence in the occupied lands. Since the Palestinian uprising broke out in December 1987, 339 Arabs and 14 Israelis have been killed. In the past, clandestine leaders of the uprising and prominent Palestinians above ground have called for elections, but the latest underground leaflets and a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee both opposed the Israeli proposals. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor at An <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said the election idea was another Israeli attempt to find an alternative to recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Why stall and lose time and try to escape the realities of peacemaking,'' he said. `` I think we should tell <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that instead of introducing such ideas you should face the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Khazmo </PERSON>, Palestinian publisher of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bayader </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siyassi </ORGANIZATION> magazine in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, noted that of the Palestinian officials elected in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> municipal elections in 1972 and 1976, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deposed nine mayors and deported three others. `` Even if we say yes to the elections who will guarantee that the Israelis will not interfere in such elections?'' he said. Despite such doubts, some Palestinians have given conditional support to the idea. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, proposed balloting be held in three stages: a referendum on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of independence, municipal elections and selection of representatives who could serve as a link to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` These Palestinians can serve as a bridge -LRB- with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- if they are allowed to go back and forth -LRB- to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> -RRB- and carry messages,'' he said. The Israeli concept of elections has not been clearly defined. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aides have suggested elections would choose a new leadership to talk with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about a settlement. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aides suggest elections would choose only an administrative council as part of a Palestinian autonomy scheme. The liberal daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Palestinian willingness for a truce had been conveyed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats by leading figures in the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Transcript of Pentagon Briefing on Base Closings Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a condensed transcript of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing Thursday on recommendations by the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary's commission on military base closings Participants were Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV and commission co-chairmen <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. RIBICOFF: We believe the results reflect a balanced report to eliminate unnecessary installation capacity without restricting the flexibility of our national security managers during future mobilizations, contingencies and changes in the international political environment. The recommended changes reflect an opportunity to improve the nation's defense position. EDWARDS: We would like to take this opportunity ... to thank the department and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for this opportunity to participate in a unique effort, which will not only save taxpayers dollars, but also improve our national defense posture. During the course of developing our recommendations, we used improvement in military value of our domestic base structure as the preeminent consideration. Our report presents an opportunity to reduce training costs in terms of manpower, overhead costs and fuel, to improve command and control, to consolidate training and improve economies of scale, and to remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense managers. Add to these improvements an opportunity to eliminate some future military construction costs and to save almost $ 700 million a year in base operating costs with a 20-year net present value of $ 5.6 billion. Despite these improvements, we do not anticipate any substantial socio-economic disruption to the communities that are closely linked with bases recommended for closure. In terms of environmental impact, we see little negative impact from these recommendations, and in many instances, improvement for the natural surroundings. RIBICOFF: There are 145 installations affected. There are 86 for closure, five for partial closure, 54 bases have been realigned. The estimation is $ 693 million saved per year in base operating costs and $ 5.6 billion to be saved over 20 years on the net present value. ... There are about 20 major ones. EDWARDS: I guess generally you would look at the <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> area _ <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION>. Generally, you would look in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION>. Generally, you would probably look at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> national capital region area which would include <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, <PERSON> Belvoir </PERSON> and Holabird. You would look at perhaps <ORGANIZATION> Pease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. I guess those are the big areas. RIBICOFF: It goes from page 52 to page 69 -LRB- in the report -RRB-, and I think you will find that to be a very accurate explanation of the rationale and what is happening to those bases. EDWARDS: -LRB- Fort -RRB- Dix -LRB- <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- is going into what we call `` semi-active status.'' There will be a group of probably 500 or so people there who will maintain it, have it available for Reserve activity, have it available for active duty training from time to time, have it available in the event troops are brought home from some part of the world. It will be there to support <ORGANIZATION> McGuire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- and -RRB- the naval station at <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>. We broke down all of the military facilities into various categories. And in our breakdown, <PERSON> Dix </PERSON> came out at the bottom of the list in a category where we had excess capacity _ basic training, advanced individual training and these types of things. We have moved those kinds of activities from <PERSON> Dix </PERSON> to various facilities in the country, some to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, some to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leonard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, some to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> And in the process, we moved some out of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bliss </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, so all of it becomes compatible. What we've tried to do is bring training areas together to the extent that we could, where we could justify it. Q. You mentioned in your opening statement that you did n't expect any of these -LRB- communities -RRB- to be adversely affected by this. I think a lot of the communities will find that hard to swallow. EDWARDS: Of course they will. I said `` substantial socio-economic impact.'' Of course they will have a hard time swallowing it. ... There are some areas where the impact is obviously larger than others. But we have a section in here ... that deals with ways in which communities can help themselves when they feel this kind of impact. The Office of Economic Adjustment in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a great ability to move in and help a community work out its problems. Where possible, we have not moved troops across the country but next door, in the same state or in an adjoining state. Q. Perhaps you could tell me what sort of thinking went into your decision to close the Presidio in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>? EDWARDS: The Presidio sits in the middle of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> or thereabouts, and it ca n't grow. It ca n't do any more than it's doing There's no way it can expand. It's prohibited by laws of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other laws as far as expansion is concerned. It's in a high-value area, and the operations at the Presidio can be done by and large most anywhere.

 Q. To what extent does the property value of these bases that you've chosen play a role in your decision ... and how many total jobs are we talking about here being lost? EDWARDS: The first thing we looked at was military value, without a doubt. I mean, that was our touchstone. And if a base had military value, then we did n't bother it. If the base was lacking in military value, then it became a candidate to look at. We obviously did not ignore cost savings. We used ... as our guideline a six-year payback, as set out in the charter. And so if a facility did not meet the six-year payback, then it's not in our list. In some instances, we looked at estimates as to what we could sell the property for, but it was not the cornerstone of our activity. Q. How about the jobs question? EDWARDS: I do n't know whether we actually totaled all that. You'll see a column that talks about personnel out and personnel in, both military and civilian. And I think if you'll ust run your finger down the column to the area you're looking for, you'll see the impact. Q. Is this the end of it, in your mind? Or can a year from now a similar commission come back and recommend a similar number of bases? I mean, a $ 5.6 billion savings over a certain number of years is rather insignificant when you consider the total defense budget. RIBICOFF: We think the basic responsibility should be in the hands of the secretary of defense. There should be an ongoing study to see what changes should be made in the bases. We've recommended that there should be a high-level, small group of people to go over this with the secretary of defense, but I would hope that there would n't always be a commission like ours that would be necessary to do the whole job over again. The training is altogether different with the new technology. We're going to have to acquire larger tracts of land. Many of the present bases are limited because they have been surrounded by large urban areas and their effectiveness has been destroyed. So I think the country is going to have to take a good, hard look, and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, as to what future training will have to be for future wars and the changes that are going to take place. Q. Can you tell us what the up-front costs of closing and realigning these bases are? EDWARDS: Well, let's see, the <ORGANIZATION> Najavo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, just to pull one out of there. It's going to cost $ 11 million to make that move. But it will pay back in annual savings $ 3.05 million. And so it's going to take us four years to recover that initial cost of the move before we start making annual savings. But then they are annual savings forever. Q. As two former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, how do you think ... the reaction on the Hill will be to this? EDWARDS: I believe the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, favor this exercise taking place. There's no question that many congressmen and senators are going to be upset when they see this list, especially if it affects -LRB- their -RRB- community. I would anticipate, from my own general conversations ... from the time we were appointed to the present, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will accept it. Q. There are some lawmakers, especially from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who have already argued that the ... the state has been unfairly hit here. Your reaction to that? EDWARDS: A lot of the activity in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that is reported in here has to do with <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON>. They are both encroached by air traffic congestion from the <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> airport. They ca n't train adequately because of that problem. They both have major problems in attracting high-technology employees because of the activity in that area in the civilian sector. And we felt that we really just had no alternative but to deal with that. Mather -LRB- Air Force Base, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB-, they are a good distance away from their training area. They have to fly over 150 nautical miles just to get to the area where they train their particular aircraft and pilots. We have moved them into <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where there is an electronic training range right there. ... I like to think there's a rationale to what we've done. RIBICOFF: I think they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- recognize the great changes that have taken place in training with the present type of equipment and the present time of aircraft and what has happened in the urban areas, and they realize that changes have to be made. And <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ... is the fastest growing state in the Union, when it comes to urban encroachment and the elimination of open spaces that air forces need. Q. What happens if the list is rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? Will you gentlemen start over? EDWARDS: We are a one-shot, unique kind of an organization. When we hand this report over, we are finished.

 Q. Congressman -LRB- Les -RRB- <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> -LRB- D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- suggested that there was a loophole in this whole procedure and that funds had to be appropriated annually to close these bases and, by use of that loophole, bases could be prevented from being closed Did you address that question and what did you do about it? EDWARDS: There is a problem, because the proceeds of the sales of these facilities will go into the fund to carry out the purposes of this law. And those proceeds are not going to start coming in on Day One. It's going to take a while to come in. And so we have recommended in this report that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in -LRB- fiscal 1990 -RRB- appropriate $ 300 million to put the first money in the fund so we can start the process. And obviously, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refuses to appropriate enough money to get ... the process going, then it's going to be very difficult Q. It's often said that certain bases have remained open over the years for political or pork barrel reasons. Did you find any evidence of that in your study? And how far have you gone to eliminating it, if that's the case? RIBICOFF: I do n't think there was any influence or any attempt to protect pork barrel bases. I do n't think that was taken into account at all. I do n't think anybody on the commission felt any pressure. We looked at these bases seriously. We looked at all the figures. We spent a lot of time in discussion. Each and every base was voted on unanimously, with the action taken. EDWARDS: You should understand first that we simply did not start with a list. ... We started with a set of criteria which we applied to all 4,300 installations in this country. ... And we took those as we found them. Q. There are four states that are missing _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, all home states of the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Appropriations Committees. Were there no bases in those states worthy of closing? EDWARDS: That's certainly not by design. We did take a little something out of <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, I recall. I do n't believe we touched <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, I'm going to bet, does n't have a whole lot of military in the first place. ... We had to deal with bases where we found them. Q. Could you please elaborate on some of the personnel changes that are going to take place at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION> and some of the other bases that are getting increases of people? RIBICOFF: We found that certain missions were split between a number of bases _ they did n't make any sense _ when they should have been consolidated and put in one base. And what we did in many instances, we just do that, and especially when you talk about <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>. ... You will find a shift from one fort to the other, one base to the other, which will make it more effective, more efficient, and be able to do a much better job with their mission. Q. I wonder if you had the opportunity to pass judgment on the value of strategic home porting, to see whether dispersion of ships offers protection in the nuclear age, or whether it's really just a way of building local political support for various naval tasks. EDWARDS: I do n't know anything that was discussed more than strategic home porting. ... We concluded that our job was not to deal with force structure. That's the military's job. ... Our job was to try to deal with that force structure as we found it, and try to accommodate it to the facilities that we were working with. And so we had to live with the fact that there's going to be a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Maybe there never will be ... but we do n't know that. So we had to look at the home ports with an idea where are you going to put that other 150 ships that are building up from the 450-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. And we concluded that we could justify some home ports, most of them. Q. If it were not for political constraints, could you actually ... expand your list? Are there a lot of other bases you consider still vulnerable or could be effectively closed? EDWARDS: The biggest constraint ... is the six-year payback constraint. We found a lot of facilities that had 10-year paybacks, 12-year paybacks, even 20-year paybacks, where we could have made some major savings over a longer period of time. But we were constrained by our charter, which had a six-year payback. RIBICOFF: Once you got over the six years, we had to stop. I think wisdom and better planning would have been more meaningful if we were n't stuck with that six-year payback. Q. In other words, some of these places survived because of their inefficiency? EDWARDS: No, I think it may cost a lot of money to move one facility into another base and have to build all-new construction, and your payback just simply wo n't make it.

 RIBICOFF: It just goes to prove that there's still a lot of work to be done, and it should be ongoing. And I would hope the next secretary of defense would take this job very, very seriously. ... There's money to be saved. And with tight budget restraints, you're going to have to save it wherever you can for basic important purposes in the defense establishment Q. Some of the bases are under construction, such as the naval station in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. What's the rationale for closing that? The state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has already spent $ 8 million building a highway to it. EDWARDS: My recollection is that we could save $ 8 million a year forever. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- We concluded that <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> was primarily a reserve center in the home port plan, that <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> had only had one oiler and one minesweeper, and that they could be moved to <LOCATION> Engleside </LOCATION>, so that we would put together in one place in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> the carrier, the battleship and the support ships. That's the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Then on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, you would have the Pascagoula-Mobile-Pensacola complex. So you'd have two complexes on the Gulf instead of whatever they were. Q. Some of the bases have been on hit lists. Things have changed over the years. The base that led to the obstructing legislation was <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. What has changed over the years to make that cold-weather base, which was considered obsolete in 1977, necessary now? REP. EDWARDS: I ca n't give you chapter and verse, because it did n't come through on our six-year payback. ... One of the things we had to deal with was the fact that a lot of the bases that were along the coast, such as <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, the airplanes that would go in a base like that are better centrally located in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the time it takes for the Soviets or some enemy to get a missile lobbed in. And you do n't need them right up on the front lines anymore. Q. Did you at all assess the impact on defense contractors that support these facilities? EDWARDS: We did not. RIBICOFF: No. Q. I could not find <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- anywhere. Who saved it? EDWARDS: Me. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- I personally went to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> to look at it. And I saw the moat and ... the old historic buildings. ... I also saw what would amount to around $ 900 million in cleanup costs to get rid of the old shells that had been lobbed over on part of that fort for the last 200 years or however long it was. I also saw the cost of building new facilities to house all of those people _ 3,000 or 4,000 people as I recall _ and it just did n't even come close to our six-year payback. It was more like a 20-year payback at best. And in part because there's no real market value for that property. It would become, perhaps, a museum one day. ... I do n't know any developer in his right mind who would want to go in there and buy that property

<HEAD>Americans, Vietnamese To Excavate Remains Of Giant Ape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American scientists today said they will join Vietnamese archeologists in a remote cave outside <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to search for remains of the largest known ape _ a 9-foot primate that became extinct 200,000 years ago. The excavation, planned for Jan. 4-28, is being billed as the first field research project involving scientists of the two countries since the beginning of the war in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. Paleoanthropologist <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciochon </PERSON> said he and three other Americans would join about 10 Vietnamese scientists at the limestone cave where remains have been found of the `` Gigantopithecus,'' an ape known only from sites in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Despite some earlier research by Vietnamese, East German and French scientists, very little is known about the giant, which is related to the orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla. Only jawbones and teeth of the animal have been uncovered but <PERSON> Ciochon </PERSON> said the team hoped to find more remains in the cave, 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, which served as a weapons depot and bomb shelter during the Vietnam War. `` One thing we know about it is that it was very big,'' <PERSON> Ciochon </PERSON> told reporters. It was probably a four-footed, vegetarian animal weighing about 770 pounds that became extinct 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, the Americans said. There is speculation early man may have hunted the ape to extinction. The team hopes to establish relationships between `` homo erectus,'' the direct ancestor of modern humans, stone tools used by early man and the giant ape since the remains of all three have been found in the area of the cave. <PERSON> Ciochon </PERSON>, from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, said the Americans were bringing in special rock saws and generators for the excavation. He said these would be turned over to Vietnamese counterparts when the Americans returned home. Two Vietnamese scientists are to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later, bringing fossils from the excavation site. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which is sending a team to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to film a documentary on the excavation, is the main backer of the expedition. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have no diplomatic relations, informal exchanges have increased the past two years. However, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> permits far more American academics, journalists and others to visit <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does Vietnamese to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ciochon </PERSON> said members of his team had visited <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988 for preliminary surveys. <PERSON> Ciochon </PERSON> said research on the Gigantopithecus in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been hampered by site disturbances: remains of the ape have been ground up to be sold as medicine. In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he said, this practice does not exist and the potential of finding substantial fossil remains is considerable. Other American members of the expedition are Ms. <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semendeferi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Government Recaptures Outposts After Bloody Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government forces have recaptured a strategic area from <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> insurgents after three months of fighting that claimed at least 444 lives, a government spokesman said today. The government launched its offensive at <LOCATION> Methawaw </LOCATION> on Dec. 16 and retook the three outposts on Christmas Eve, spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told a weekly news briefing. The Karens, probably the strongest of the dozen guerrilla groups fighting the government, claims to control most of the 1,350-mile frontier with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. This ethnic minority group has been fighting for greater autonomy since 1949. Until government forces first captured it in 1984, the <LOCATION> Methawaw </LOCATION> area served as a key transport and communications route for the Karens. In that area, they also acquired funds for their insurgency by taxing those responsible for the smuggling of narcotics between <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The Karens seized three of the five government outposts there last September but the government then sent in large numbers of reinforcements. The spokesman said the two sides fought 85 `` major battles'' and 145 other engagements in three months. The area is on the west bank of the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> separating <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, and 130 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He said 240 government soldiers, including 12 officers, were killed and 922 wounded. The spokesman said the bodies of 204 rebels had been counted as of Saturday. Seized from them, he said, was a large amount of automatic weapons, hand grenades and ammunition.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans hearings early next year to discuss lifting a World War II-era regulation that bars apparel manufacturers from employing seamstresses in their homes. The department planned to publish in today's edition of the Federal Register an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as the first formal step for lifting the ban, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a deputy assistant labor secretary in charge of enforcing the prohibition. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the action last October after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> won approval from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget office to remove homework prohibitions in five other apparel fields effective Jan. 8. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will hold hearings on the proposal in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Feb. 22-23; in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on March 2-3; and in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on March 8-9.

<TEXT>
 Racial strife involving African students has spread to a second Chinese city, with Africans at a university in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> protesting rumors they were carriers of the disease AIDS. About 65 Africans attending <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> have stayed in their dormitory since Monday, boycotting classes and demanding to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a student from <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> said. He said university officials have blocked attempts to leave the eastern <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> city. The student, speaking on condition of anonymity, said university officials had implied they were carriers of the fatal disease AIDS. `` They treat us like criminals,'' he said. Further details of the dispute were inpeded by poor telephone connections. University officials were not available for comment. <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> is about 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, scene of five days of anti-African demonstrations stemming from a Christmas Eve fight between African students and Chinese. Chinese officials have isolated about 140 African students and other foreign sympathizers in a remote guest house outside the city to protect them from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> demonstrators demanding Africans responsible for injuring 11 Chinese be brought to justice. The Chinese side has refused the Africans' request to leave <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, and only those students who agree to return to their schools are being allowed to leave the guest house. Almost all the Africans say they fear for their safety and will not return to the city. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s leading daily, ran a front-page story today for the second straight day expressing understanding for the anger of the Chinese youth and saying, `` The troublemakers, a minority of foreign students, will be punished.'' `` Africans come from developing countries and are struggling,'' the article said. `` This is not easy ... but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not forgive those students who break <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s law.'' The story also appealed for calm, and quoted professors from <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` We must n't turn a school's problem into a social problem. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiju </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that no Chinese would be punished for breaking windows and destroying property at the African students dormitory during the Christmas Eve brawl. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said seven or eight Africans were being investigated for their involvement in the fight, which began when Africans refused to register the names of their Chinese girlfriends they were taking to a campus party. A Palestinian student in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> said today that Chinese who visited the guest house the previous day had been told seven Africans, the same `` troublemakers'' referred to by <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, had been separated from the other foreign students. There are an estimated 1,500 Africans from 40 nations studying at Chinese universities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has long provided scholarships for Africans in solidarity with developing African states, but social tensions, which Africans attribute to ingrained racial prejudices against blacks, have occasionally flared out into violence between the Chinese and Africans.

 Chicago-born <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said today his family has received permission to emigrate and that he would finally be leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time in more than a half-century. `` There's no feeling yet.

The long struggle came to an end when <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law received word she would be allowed to join the rest of the family in emigrating. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, his wife and son received exit visas in 1975 but his daughter-in-law was not given a visa, so the family decided not to leave. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>'s case has been the subject of negotiations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviets for years and its resolution was another in a series of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> moves to improve the country's human rights record. Numerous prominent refuseniks, or Jews denied permission to emigrate, have been allowed to leave since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in March 1985. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, a 77-year-old Jew, has not been out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since his parents, ardent American Communists, brought him here in 1931. His parents left the American Depression behind to help build the new <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but in 1937, his father disappeared in one of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s bloody purges. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, who still holds <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship, served with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during World War II and afterward became an announcer and translator for Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I have news now,'' an excited <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said in beginning the phone call. He explained that he was numb after learning his family could leave. `` They drag it out so long. It's been 13 -LCB- years. They try to drag it out. The main thing now is to try to be calm and not to forget anything, which is hard.'' His 29-year-old son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, said he was not very excited. `` I have no special feelings,'' he said. `` Perhaps in some time I will feel happy, but now perhaps it's shock. I ca n't say I am happy but I can not say I am not happy.'' The younger <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said he was probably reserved because he was worried about friends who are having trouble emigrating, and who are not getting the support like his family did from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said his wife, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurukht </PERSON>, had telephoned <ORGANIZATION> OVIR </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency that handles emigration matters, on Monday and Tuesday. A deputy chief of the office said she would be allowed to join the family in emigrating. A postcard confirming the verbal notification is expected to arrive next week, and then the family plans to fly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. After getting settled in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the family plans to make their first trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to visit friends. The latest in a series of snags that held up Ms. <PERSON> Shurukht </PERSON>'s emigration was that her mother refused to sign a form saying her daughter did not have any financial obligations to her <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said the mother apparently has now signed the form.

<TEXT>
 A political analyst says <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' third-party bid for mayor may wind up accomplishing the very things he hoped to avoid _ splitting the black vote and returning a <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to city hall <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> announced Thursday that he was withdrawing from February's Democratic primary to run in the general election as the candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Harold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which he created and named after <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first black mayor That leaves Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' chief black rival, in a primary showdown against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor and son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for more than two decades. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> repeatedly said he was not endorsing <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in the primary, but urged supporters to `` do whatever they can do to defeat <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>,'' who according to early polls is the front-runner among announced candidates. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> may ultimately regret both positions, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, author of a biography of the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and a veteran political observer. `` He urged black voters to keep away from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Then he made repeated references to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> as though he were somehow evil ... and that all whites, by implication, were somehow ` the enemy.' `` On the one hand, he weakens the very cause he purports to support _ a black mayor for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. On the other, he's galvanized the -LRB- white ethnic -RRB- opposition,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 45, was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s floor leader in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and has tried since the late mayor's death to portray himself as heir to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s legacy as a reformer. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 54, was chosen to succeed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by many of the same <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members who were <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest opponents. He and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> have waged a costly struggle for the loyalty of the black community. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said some believed <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> should have withdrawn from the primary `` because it is clear from all the available evidence I am the choice of an overwhelming majority of our coalition. `` But as he has refused to do so, I will make that move _ secure in the knowledge that I am at once serving, uniting and leading our great coalition on a course that will result in a historic victory,'' he added. The <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> camps expressed little surprise at <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' move Thursday `` Mr. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has said all along that what's important are the issues _ crime, education and health _ not who's in or who's out or what the numbers are,'' said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>. `` Mayor <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> did not expect <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' endorsement in the primary and he'd have been surprised if there was one,'' said a <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> spokesman who refused to be identified. `` The mayor felt all along the important thing was to remove the onus from both himself and Mr. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of splitting the black vote,'' the spokesman said. That was everybody's greatest fear and that has now been removed.''

<HEAD>Students Return To Capital After Fleeing Military Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty-six students who fled <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military crackdown flew home today, and authorities allowed a one-month extension for thousands of others to return from the Thai border region Government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told reporters the government had extended its deadline from Saturday to Jan. 31 for the students to return. A Burmese air force plane brought back the second group of students since the government announced all students who fled after the Sept. 18 military coup and had sought haven could return without retribution. A group of 80 students arrived in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Monday from a special transition camp in the northern <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> city of Tak, near guerrilla-held border areas. Among the second group was <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Myint </PERSON>, 20. His elder brother had returned on Monday, and at that time their father made an emotional plea for the return of his other son. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Myint </PERSON> wept when he asked a reporter about his father, and was told of the plea. He said he did not accompany his brother earlier because, `` I was skeptical about the government's intention. I am now convinced that it is genuine, and we are safe to be back in our country. I am sure others will also return. We heard on the radio about the receptions here.'' Another student, <PERSON> Hkun </PERSON> <PERSON> Thaung </PERSON> <PERSON> Myine </PERSON>, said he felt sorry for his colleagues left behind, some of whom he said `` may have difficulties in escaping from the rebels.'' Thai officials said 19 other students remained in the camp in <LOCATION> Tak </LOCATION>, including some whose departures were delayed because they were waiting for friends and relatives still staying with Burmese insurgents along the border. They estimate 7,000 students remain along the border. University students led massive nationwide demonstrations for democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> until the new military authorities crushed the protests. Many of the students found jungle life too harsh or said the guerrillas mistreated them. The protests prompted the resignation in July of Ne Win, who overthrew a civilian government in 1962 and led <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s only political party since then. In August, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in 26 years, declared an end to a multiparty state and promised elections He was overthrown by army Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> a month later. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> also has promised elections but has not issued a date for elections. The agreement to repatriate the students was reached by <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> army chief who on Dec. 14 became the first high foreign official to visit <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since the coup.

 Rain drenched the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and snow spread from the <LOCATION> Cascades </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today as much of the nation from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the central Plains enjoyed fair weather. More than 2 -LCB- inches of rain fell Thursday at <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, as snow caused major problems farther inland. A blizzard forced <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> authorities to close part of Interstate 84, stranding holiday travelers along a 170-mile stretch of the highway. Blowing snow reduced visibility to near zero, prompting the state Highway Division to close the freeway about 9:30 a.m. Thursday. Troopers patrolling the nearly deserted highway reported continuing poor conditions 12 hours after the freeway was closed. Local officials said about 50 people spent the night at the local armory, 60 to 75 stayed at a local Baptist church, a dozen stayed in a local crisis action center, and an unknown number of private homes were opened to travelers. <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, received 3 more inches of new snow Thursday evening, leaving 8 total inches on the ground thus far. Snow and freezing rain advisories continued for the Cascade mountains through the night. Up to 10 inches of new snow was expected in the higher Cascade passes; freezing rain in the lower passes. Snow spread into western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and gusty winds up to 81 mph also hit western and central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Clouds and isolated rain spread across southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and snow showers were scattered in the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and northern Great Lakes region. Snow showers also lingered in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. High pressure dominated from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> into the central Plains, providing fair weather. The nation's high Thursday was 84 degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Myers </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, both in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Today's forecast called for rain in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, snow in the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and northern parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>; showers and thunderstorms from eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> across the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; snow showers in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

 A college lecturer was cleared of charges he made a bomb threat on an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight after an 11-year-old boy admitted he wrote the note and left it on the aircraft, says an apologetic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Charges against <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Canning </PERSON>, a lecturer in literature at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>, were dropped Thursday after the boy told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he wrote the note. Canning, 40, found the note on an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner Tuesday, gave it to a flight attendant and was arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s top <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> agent, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, said he `` regrets any inconvenience and embarassment suffered by Mr. Canning.'' `` However, the investigation fully warranted the arrest of Canning, which occurred after consulting with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said Canning, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> doctoral candidate, could not be reached for comment because he was driving home to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> when the charges were dropped by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. He had been released on his own recognizance the previous day. Canning had insisted all along that the note fell into his lap from his seat tray while lunch was being served on the flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. He handed the note to a flight attendant, who notified the pilot. The plane was diverted to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> and was searched for about four hours with bomb-sniffing dogs. The boy came forward with his parents Thursday, and admitted writing the note during a flight to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earlier Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Beldon </PERSON>. The note was put on the pullout tray before it was stowed away, he said. The note said: `` Read this. There are guns pointed at you. If you want to live, read the letter underneath and do what it says. This is a bomb scare. Read this. PS If you do what the letter says, and have everyone else do it, you will live. PS If you do n't, you are history!! There are bombs planted all over this airplane and there is a gun pointed at your head. Take your wallet and throw it in the aisle now.'' At the time of the arrest, federal agents said there were similarities between Canning's handwriting and the note. Agents determined that the boy sat in the seat later occupied by Canning, <PERSON> Beldon </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> declined to prosecute the boy. Canning's attorney, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Twohig </PERSON>, had said the arrest resulted from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> confusion. `` I'm glad they've cleared up their confusion,'' he said Thursday. Asked if the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last week might have affected the way this case was handled, <PERSON> Twohig </PERSON> said: `` Sure, everybody was jumpy. `` I just hope that people who read about this and hear about this are n't discouraged from reporting things,'' <PERSON> Twohig </PERSON> said. Canning has said he almost withheld the note.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell in early European trading today, losing more than 1 cent against the British pound. Gold prices were mixed. Trading was thin on the last business day of 1988, giving some transactions an exaggerated effect on rates, foreign currency dealers said. `` The market is already semi-closed,'' said one dealer in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Banks have only skeleton staffs on duty and are limiting business to postition-squaring and to serving corporate customers with some last-minute requirements, he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.13 yen to close the year at 125.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.42 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday: _ 1.7798 West German marks, down from 1.7875 _ 1.5065 Swiss francs, down from 1.5125 _ 6.0795 French francs, down from 6.0975 _ 2.0118 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0190 _ 1,313.00 Italian lire, down from 1,314.50 _ 1.1910 Canadian dollars, down from 1.191225 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8015, Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 409.50 a troy ounce, up from $ 408.25 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Pepperidge Farm To Remove Tropical Oils From Crackers, Cookies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who spent $ 2 million to pressure the food industry into making healthier products says he's pleasantly surprised by <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to stop using coconut oil in crackers and cookies. `` Ultimately Pepperidge Farms will have saved thousands of lives,'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said Thursday. Coconut oil is a saturated fat that raises cholesterol levels. People who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of clogged arteries that can lead to heart disease. <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it would stop using coconut oil in numerous products, including its popular `` Original Goldfish,'' in response to `` strong consumer concern.'' `` Frankly, I'm surprised, because <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> has a multimillion-dollar undertaking on their hands to change their products,'' said <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, founder of the Nebraska-based National Heart Savers. Pepperidge Farm will have to come up with new recipes for more than 50 brands of cookies and crackers, said <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, whose group has campaigned against products using tropical oils. `` We must find oils that will proximate tropical oils in terms of performance in the baking process, flavor, texture, mouth-feel and shelf-life stability,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, president of the Norwalk-based company, said in a statement issued Wednesday. Coconut and palm oil are popular with food manufacturers because they help extend the shelf life of food products, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. Many products advertised as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help cholesterol form after consumption, he said. Coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat than lard. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> placed advertisments in newspapers in October depicting nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods, but are `` poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats. A 65-year-old multimillionaire who nearly died from a heart attack in 1966, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> has spent $ 2 million to pressure food industry giants into making healthier products. His father and a brother-in-law died of heart attacks.

 Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is producing chemical weapons at eight plants and organizing chemical warfare units to help maintain superiority over South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, officials said today. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> disclosed for the first time that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was producing chemical weapons, including poison gas, at eight cities, including Sinhung and <LOCATION> Sinuju </LOCATION>. Chemical weapons would probably be used to knock out <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces as part of lightning attacks if the North invaded, officials said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 42,000 troops based in the South under a defense pact. The report, part of an overview on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and North Korean military forces, said the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> also has six storage sites for chemical weapons and three research and development centers. Storage centers are located near the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> border for possible use in a war, the report said. Chemical weapons factories are based in the north of the country, with many close to the Chinese and Soviet borders, it said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were aware of reports of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s chemical warfare capability, but declined to comment further. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had formed chemical warfare units and attached them to infantry regiments, officials said. The North is expected to eventually deploy chemical, they said. The North is also producing Soviet-designed `` Scud'' and `` Frog'' missiles with ranges of up to 180 miles that could be used to deliver chemical warheads, officials said. The officials could not say when chemical weapons might be deployed by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. They noted that the North had been developing chemical weapons since the 1960s. South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have anti-chemical warfare gear, such as gas masks and chemical warfare suits. The two governments decline to say if they deploy chemical weapons in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> reportedly possess battlefield nuclear weapons, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> refuses to confirm or deny the reports. The South Korean report noted that <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is making advances in building up its defenses and expects to end the North's military superiority by the start of the next century. But it said that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> still has a substantial edge in troops and weapons and was producing large numbers of tanks, artillery pieces, rockets and other weapons. North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been conducting talks aimed at easing tensions, but the bitter rivals have hundreds of thousands of heavily-armed troops poised along their border. The two nations were formed after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces ended the Japanese occupation at the end of the Second World War in 1945. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950, prompting the bloody three-year Korean War.

 Reporter <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> has revealed that the late <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was the confidential source for his best-selling insider's look at the high court, `` The Brethren.'' In an interview published in the February issue of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter said he was willing to identify <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> because the former justice is dead. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> died in 1985 at age 70. `` I'm revealing his name now, for the first time, because it's worth showing that there really are sources, people do talk,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said `` It's not some reporter's imagination or some letter that comes in the mail with no address, typed on a standard typewriter,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. `` You have relationships, you nurture them and they pay off.'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> at a party in the spring of 1977. `` The Brethren'' was published in 1979. Although <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> was willing to identify his main source for `` The Brethren,'' which he wrote with reporter <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, he told <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> he was not ready to identify `` Deep Throat.'' `` Deep Throat'' was the key informer <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> used for their Pulitzer Prize-winning articles uncovering the 1972 Watergate scandal in Post and for their subsequent best-selling book, `` All the President's Men.'' `` As you know, I'm not going to discuss the identity of Deep Throat or any other of my confidential sources who are still alive,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> turned out to have `` real intellectual disdain'' for former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> and former Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, both appointees of President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s animosities became clear as he worked on the book, and were probably the reason <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> allowed him to have a behind-the-scenes look at the high court. `` What also came across ... was <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s contempt for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. `` He felt that what had happened with <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s -LRB- <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> -RRB- and my Watergate reporting was very important for the country and for journalism and for subduing this rightist movement in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, tamping it down and saying ` Whoa.

 Eleven people were killed and 20 others injured when an explosion blew up a house where illegal fireworks were being made, police said today. About 10 people were making firecrackers and sparklers late Thursday in a house in this town 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> when two barrels of powder ignited, destroying the residence and four others in the neighborhood. The explosion, heard several miles away, triggered a fire that damaged five other homes before authorities could extinguish the blaze. Police said five of the dead, including three who were dismembered, were killed instantly, while the rest died in nearby hospitals. Such explosions are annual occurrences in <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION> province, the center of the country's flourishing but illegal fireworks industry. Two similar accidents killed 15 people last year. `` I am appalled by this kind of destruction,'' said Bulacan Gov. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagdanganan </PERSON>, who visited the scene early today. <PERSON> Pagdanganan </PERSON> said the explosion occurred only about an hour after he warned <LOCATION> Bocaue </LOCATION> authorities to crack down on the industry, outlawed in the mid-1960s after a series of deadly explosions and fires.

 Two French girls held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for 13 months by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist group rejoined their father and went into seclusion today in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Their hometown, meanwhile, prepared a homecoming celebration. The long journey home took <PERSON> Marie-Laure </PERSON> <PERSON> Betille </PERSON>, 7, and her sister <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, 6, by boat from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, where they were turned over to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials and flown to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> late Thursday. Their hometown of <LOCATION> Ollioules </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION>, set up welcoming banners and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flags on its streets today. Mayor <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaud </PERSON> said the town would give the girls a belated Christmas celebration. Left behind in the hands of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Palestinian guerrilla organization, was their mother, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>; a baby sister born in captivity; and five Belgians also seized aboard the yacht Silco off <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Their captors, who have been blamed for numerous terrorist attacks, said the girls' freedom was a gift to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from the children of the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. French newspapers today suggested the release was a propaganda ploy by <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to improve his image at a time when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has raised concerns about an alleged chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The Palestinian kidnappers are backed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Marie-Laure, <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON> and their father, <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> <PERSON> Betille </PERSON>, arrived in a French government plane at a secluded military base near <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. They were then taken to a hospital for checkups and then to a secret location for sleep. The girls, dressed in dark robes, their shoulders draped with plaid Arab scarves, had been reunited with their father hours earlier in the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Betille </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Massiani </PERSON>, said Thursday night that the children had said nothing of their detention, `` talking only of their boat trip.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve, and on two occasions they were reported freed and en route home. The Palestinian group has ties to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> ... welcomes this humanitarian gesture in appropriate measure,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It thanks foreign authorities who contributed,'' it added without elaboration. A statement in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said the girls' release was `` a gift to the French authorities ... in the name of the children of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, the children of the Revolution of the Stones on the occasion of Christmas and New Year.'' <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said Saturday the girls would be freed following a call from <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. In the following days, he said they were en route home. But when there was no sign of the children, the initial suspense turned to confusion and despair for relatives who spent the Christmas weekend in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> seeking the children's release. There was no immediate comment from the children's relatives about their arrival. A later dispatch by the official Libyan news agency reported a call from <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to `` liberation movements'' to free all hostages. `` Once again, I ask the Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the rest of the liberation movements in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to respond to my appeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holy occasion,'' <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` Holy occasion'' was apparently a reference to Christmas. Fatah-Revolutionary Council announced the capture of the hostages in a yacht off the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Nov. 8, 1987. It accused the captives of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a charge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the family has denied. The group has been blamed for dozens of hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it broke with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1976. Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, who is separated from the father of Marie-Laure and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in a recent videotape that she is pregnant again. The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian factions.

 When baggage and wreckage from the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash was sent to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halstead </LOCATION> for forensic tests, some experts said they believed even more strongly that a bomb destroyed the plane. They knew that <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON> meant the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>'s leading bomb experts would be entering the investigation into the Dec. 21 crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 Their work at the country's main center for developing explosives and armaments proved crucial when it was determined that a bomb caused the crash, and could help determine the bombers as well, experts said Thursday. `` The tests were crucial in clinching the cause, i.e., that it was a bomb,'' said a spokesman from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, whose Air Accident Investigation Branch is heading the crash investigation. Working closely with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, mainly civilian experts at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halstead </LOCATION> will continue tests on wreckage from the plane, he said. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halstead </LOCATION> is the high-security headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION>, the government's center for research on defense projects ranging from new weapons to bridges and computers A <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to comment in detail about the explosives experts among the 2,500 civilians and 200 military at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halstead </LOCATION> and three other sites operated by the establishment. Explosives work centers around <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halstead </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Sevenoaks </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It's a high-security installation, which is very expert in matters of explosives and armaments research,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, a professor and terrorism expert at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` Their reputation is extremely high,'' he said in an interview, adding that Fort Halstead experts would have worked closely with experts in the Scottish town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, which bore the brunt of the crash, to get a `` broader picture'' of the crash. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON>, air transport editor of the respected aviation journal <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said that when investigators announced they were taking a suitcase and pieces of wreckage to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halstead </LOCATION> for tests, he knew they were looking for `` symptoms of an explosion.'' Investigators said the tests found residues of explosives in two parts of a `` luggage pallet'' _ the metal rack in the baggage hold in which luggage is stored. But they said they still did n't know where the bomb was planted and how it was brought aboard. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON>, head of research at the privately funded <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrorism </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said establishment experts would probably next try to find out where the bomb was planted and what type of bomb was used as a clue to identifying the bombers. `` Many terrorist groups have a particular type of favorite explosive they use,'' he said.

 A bomb exploded today near a newsstand in a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb, and police said they suspected ultra-Orthodox militants were trying to block the sale of papers they consider pornographic. The bomb exploded in Ramat Gan, causing no injuries but minor damage to a store, and police demolition experts dismantled four bombs in nearby <LOCATION> Bnei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said. She said different types of bombs were used, but that at least one was a firebomb. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio described it as a firebomb equipped with a timer. <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said no group claimed responsibility, but police suspect it was the work of ultra-Orthodox militants. `` The bombs were all found in places where secular newspapers are sold,'' <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said. Ultra-Orthodox Jews object to pictures that show unmarried men and women together, or women in revealing clothing. The deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Bnai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, said the attempted bombings were the work of `` disturbed people'' and were not sanctioned by the religious community. `` According to our past experience, when the police did catch somebody, they were disturbed people who saw the bombings as some kind of a religious commandment,'' he said. Last August, five bombs were placed near newsstands in <LOCATION> Bnei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION>. Three of the bombs exploded, causing minor damage but no injuries, and two were dismantled by police. The ultra-Orthodox Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> party condemned the latest bombing attempts, saying they violated Jewish scriptures. `` Violence is not the way of the Torah,'' the party said in a statement. `` We are convinced that it was done by radicals rejected by the Orthodox public.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> says her father was apparently trying to relieve her of the hardship of caring for a handicapped child when he killed his 2-year-old grandson, then took his own life. `` He was the kind of person who did n't want to be burdened in his own life and did n't want me to be burdened by my child,'' Ms. Day said Thursday. The <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department found the bodies of 75-year-old Hollis Day and little <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> on Wednesday night in Day's locked <PERSON> Jeep </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> Grandfather and grandson had been missing since Tuesday morning. The bodies were found on wooded, family-owned land 50 miles from the Day home. The gun lay near the bodies. Both had been shot in the head. Ms. <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said she began worrying a few hours after finding a note that read, `` Gramps and <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> have gone bye-bye together.'' `` He was having dreams, you know, of he and my son floating off into the air and reliving all these things in the hereafter _ the ... hunting and skiing and fishing trips,'' the 40-year-old woman recalled. Her father had greeted her with an extra warm hug when she woke up Tuesday morning, and told her that she was a wonderful girl and mother, Ms. <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said. She asked him to take care of <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> while she packed up Christmas gifts to head home for <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and then learned the two had taken off together in Day's vehicle, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> hastily wrapped in a coat and hat over his pajamas. Ms. Day, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> and the boy's father, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON>, had been visiting her parents. She found the note and, a few hours later, the tenor of its words suddenly merged with what her father had been saying in recent months, and it hit her: `` Bye-bye'' meant eternity. She called police, indicating a suicide was possible. `` At this point, the evidence appears consistent with a homicide-suicide theory,'' <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. Day, the retired president of a clothing company, had been scheduled for cataract surgery Thursday, and he was `` very very disturbed about my child's condition,'' she said. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, her only child, suffered from a mild form of cerebral palsy, and was considered developmentally disabled, Ms. <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said. `` When you have a handicapped child, they're a little bit more work and he thought that having a child like that would be a total altering of my lifestlye that he did n't want to see imposed upon a daughter that he loved dearly. But it was n't in my wildest dreams that he'd do this.'' But her son was `` doing just fine,'' in a hospital therapy program, she said. `` He was beginning to walk and talk ... He was a gregarious, outgoing, happy, loving, affectionate child. He was a beautiful child. ... He would have been walking eventually. ... He was not retarded _ he was a slow learner.'' With more sadness than anger, she said her father was probably just trying to help, but had been losing his ability to think rationally.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> is returning to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> some fragments of nine ancient paintings because curators have concluded the art was stolen from a 15th century B.C. tomb. The museum bought the paintings from an art dealer in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, in 1978 for an undisclosed sum and they are not considered archaeologically significant, museum officials said Thursday. The artifacts probably will be returned in the spring after a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> comes to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to supervise packing and shipping, said Museum Director <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shestack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shestack </PERSON> ordered research into the paintings last year, after the museum's Egyptian art department expressed suspicions about the legality of their origin. The museum decided to return the artifacts voluntarily because they apparently were stolen, smuggled out of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and sold into the art world, museum officials said. The fragments came from the Theban tomb of Minnakht, an official in the period of Thutmose III, and date to 1450-1420 B.C., said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, the museum's acting curator of Egyptian and ancient Near Eastern art. The tomb is located in the Nobles Tombs at <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Thutmose was considered the greatest pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, known for conquests that extended <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to the banks of the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the fourth cataract of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in what is now the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The fragments depict men and women bearing offerings, but most of the figures are only partly preserved, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said. The largest fragment is about 1 foot long and 10 inches high. The <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> dealer who sold the objects to the museum has since died, <PERSON> Shestack </PERSON> said.

 A plan to close 34 of the nation's major military facilities won the endorsement of key congressional leaders and appears headed for success. In fact, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> armed services committees, say they would like to see even more obsolete bases closed. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., pledged to work hard to ensure that the plan is not blocked by lawmakers concerned over jobs lost in their But Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., said 12,000 jobs in his district would be threatened, and urged his colleagues to oppose the base closing plan `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is about caring for human beings as we're attempting to establish the national defense, clearly there'll be a broader base of support than just those members whose districts are affected,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has until Jan. 15, five days before he leaves office, to approve or reject the entire package of recommendations, which were presented to the Pentagon on Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Base Realignment and Closure. There appeared little doubt that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> would back the proposal enthusiastically. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> then has to buy or reject the whole package, and initial comments suggested it would accept the commission's proposals despite hometown appeals from areas which would lose bases. In all, the panel, led by former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, called for closing 86 facilities, including 34 major installations and 52 military housing units. It also proposed partially closing five bases and changing the role and manpower levels at 54 others. The cuts would save an estimated $ 693 million annually and $ 5.6 billion over the next two decades. That's a small fraction of the total <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget of about $ 300 billion a year, but the closings could set a precedent. `` I think this ought to be a continuous source of study by the new -LRB- defense -RRB- secretary,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> endorses the package, it will go to the White House for the president's signature unless both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pass resolutions specifically rejecting it. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> drafted the law creating the complex procedure, which was designed to reduce political pressure to keep the bases open. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was vacationing over the holidays and had no immediate reaction to the recommendations, but spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> endorsed them. An Army spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, said he saw `` no unwarranted closures on the list'' of bases. `` If we do n't need them, we should get rid of them.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said their only objection was that the list was too short. `` I would have liked to have see more,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> called the list `` too modest'' and said it could have been up to about 30 percent longer. Neither specified which other bases could have been included. The two states hardest hit by the closures would be <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would lose <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases, a future <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base at Hunters Point in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION>, headquarters for the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> would lose <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, an Army base. `` How can we justify closing military bases in our own back yard when we do n't even consider a single one of the 1,500 overseas <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities for the same treatment?'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on readiness `` The overseas bases ought to be looked at first to make sure the need is still there,'' echoed Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democrat. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francicso </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said the commission's recommendation to close the Presidio would have `` very grave consequences'' for the city Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Democrat, said closing the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> `` will have a significant effect on the economy.'' The base is the third-largest employer in the city and has an annual payroll of $ 600 million, she said. Although most objections to the report came from politicians representing affected localities, there were hints of internal wrangling in the Pentagon. One member of the commission said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had `` stonewalled'' to avoid the heavier cuts experienced by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lost six installations, three of which had not yet entered service, compared with five major air bases lost by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 26 bases and 52 housing units that would be partially or wholly closed. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> who joined the 12-member commission part way through its seven-month review, said `` the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> stonewalled, and got away with it.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ultimately gave its cooperation. The Army begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said in an `` additional view'' at the close of the 88-page final report. For the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` intransigence paid off. When the new secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of trimming the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, he should most certainly start with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ` refused to play' this time; it should be obliged to next time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>'s criticism `` We feel we did cooperate with the commission and clearly answered whatever questions the commission had,'' said <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers argued that unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, they eliminated many facilities employing thousands of people during the 1970s. Those facilities included the <LOCATION> Quonset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Glynco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

 Women for the first time outperformed men on a fitness test required for entrance into the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police academy, following court-ordered changes that placed greater emphasis on flexibility than raw strength. <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records showed 77 percent of the female candidates passed the fitness exam between August and October, compared o 66 percent of the men. The test was revised in May 1987 after 75 female recruits who failed the old exam charged it put too much emphasis on upper-body strength and did not reflect the physical demands of police work. The new test implemented as part of an out-of-court settlement stresses flexibility and endurance. Men and women also must meet different standards and are measured against national averages for people of the same age and gender. The new tests were administered between August and October to 13 women and 113 men vying for 25 openings at the police academy.

 A masked man jumped into a bank delivery van today and drove it away, dragging a guard for 50 yards and fleeing with more than $ 2.5 million in Japanese currency, police said. The heist outside the <LOCATION> Taiyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> branch in the western Japanese city of <PERSON> Suma </PERSON> was the second-biggest cash robbery in Japanese history, officials said. The thief got into the van after it pulled up to the bank and the crew prepared to make a delivery of cash, checks and promissory notes, <ORGANIZATION> Hyogo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said. Police said the middle-aged man was familiar with the locks used in the vehicle, and that a man of the same general build had recently been seen loitering near the bank. `` The driver stepped out of the van for a second to close the rear door ... and the man jumped in and started the engine,'' a police official said. `` When the driver heard the sound of the engine, he rushed to the driver's seat and grabbed the steering wheel, but the robber pushed him back and drove away,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The driver, <PERSON> Shigetoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Oe </PERSON>, 53, held on to the window of the vehicle and was dragged for about 50 yards. Police said he was not injured. The van, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was found about two hours later abandoned in a grassy parking lot less than a mile from the bank with four empty cash boxes inside, the police official said. The van had carried 320 million yen, or about $ 2.54 million, and about $ 1.4 million in checks and promissory notes, police said. It was the second-largest cash robbery in Japanese history, police said. In 1986, a group of men wearing motorcycle helmets drove off in a cash delivery truck containing 333 million yen, about $ 2.64 million at current exchange rates.

 Gunfire killed two people and wounded 28 during demonstrations over steep price increases and demands for an end to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civil war, a senior official said today. Demonstrators took to the streets for a fourth consecutive day today, even though the government canceled the price increases because of the protests, and a general strike continued to paralyze much of the country. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Fatih </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdoun </PERSON> reported the shooting incident, saying `` an unidentified gunman'' caused the casualties when he opened fire on protesters near Cabinet offices Thursday. <PERSON> Abdoun </PERSON> gave no details. Other reports conflicted with his account but did not mention casualties. `` The action in the streets is taking on a definite anti-government flavor,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who closely follows Sudanese affairs from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital. `` It looks like the government is in serious trouble,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` There is a lot of talk about a coup attempt coming out of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> ... There is complete political chaos.'' A crisis caused by an air traffic controllers' strike appeared to have ended today. An air traffic controller in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, closed since Wednesday night as part of the general strike, was reopened around 11 a.m. Two news dispatches received in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on Thursday reported shooting near the Cabinet offices. The timing of the reports indicated there were two separate shootings. Neither mentioned casualties. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in an early afternoon dispatch, quoted the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying Sudanese police opened fire on demonstrators when they refused to disperse after being told that an emergency Cabinet session had rolled back the price increases. Reports said demonstrators also were chanting slogans calling for government action to implement a tentative peace plan. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a Khartoum-datelined report Thursday night that shooting occurred shortly after dark in the Sudanese capital, `` especially near the headquarters of the Council of Ministers.'' Commissioner <PERSON> Abdoun </PERSON>'s version of the shooting conflicted with the Sudanese agency's report on the source of gunfire, and it was impossible to tell whether he and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> news agency referred to the same incident. Another version came from the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which based its reports on the Sudanese Ministry of Information. It said one person was reported injured Thursday in `` generally peaceful'' large-scale demonstrations in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, some at the university. Sudanese police used tear gas and `` warning shots'' to disperse the protesters, it said. Strikes and demonstrations were prompted by a government decree on Monday increasing sugar prices by 500 percent and cigarettes by 50 percent, and imposing a 15 percent sales tax on all commodities. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s Cabinet met in emergency session Thursday morning and revoked the price increases. The Cabinet also considered the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from the governing coalition Wednesday night The Unionists held the second-largest number of ministerial and parliamentary seats after <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The party quit the government to protest the price increases and <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s failure to act on a tentative peace accord that a <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> leader negotiated last month with rebel leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> did not submit the accord to the Cabinet or the <ORGANIZATION> Constituent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s parliament, for endorsement because he feared that would prompt the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to leave his coalition.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganhdi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> held their second private meeting today as they sought to end four decades of friction between their countries. Sources said the meetings, which have overshadowed a summit involving seven south <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nations, have been amicable and productive. `` They're getting along famously,'' an Indian source said. `` Their meetings are going well,'' said another Indian official. Both demanded anonymity. The leaders met following a regular summit session with the leaders of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The fourth annual summit of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> comes only four weeks after Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> took office following <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first free election in 11 years. The summit has kindled hopes of closer ties between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, historically antagonistic nations. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> spoke warmly of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in his speech at the opening session Thursday night. `` I am particularly happy to be here when the people of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have elected you, Madam Prime Minister, to lead your great country forward to peace and prosperity, rooted in democracy. ... We rejoice in the prospect of friendship and cooperation between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said. After the 2 -LCB- - hour opening session, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, met privately over dinner with Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and her husband, businessman <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s session this afternoon was to last up to two hours _ much longer than those she scheduled with other visiting leaders. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> are to meet again Saturday after the summit ends. Although Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> did not refer to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in her inaugural speech, she said last week that continued animosity between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> did not serve the interest of their peoples. The two countries have fought three wars since they were partitioned in 1947 upon the demise of British colonial <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Relations have further been strained by a border dispute over <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, which was split between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> when the subcontinent was divided. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> claims part of the territory in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Protesters have demonstrated daily in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s claim <PERSON> Sardar </PERSON> <PERSON> Qayyum </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, president of the Pakistan-controlled part of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, said the protests `` have mobilized Kashmiris on this side of the cease-fire line and have shown our integrity and solidarity with those suffering on the other side.'' Other areas of friction between the nations include fears of each other's nuclear capabilities and claims that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has supported Sikh separatists who have killed 2,400 people this year in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s border state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied the charges. So far, Pakistani and Indian officials have declined to comment on the prospects of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> visiting <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> soon. She has said her first foreign trips will be to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. She is expected to make a pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, site of Islam's holiest shrine, in January, but no date has been set for a trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Today's summit session was at <LOCATION> Daman-e-Koh </LOCATION>, a white-domed retreat on a hillside overlooking <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Police with rifles stood at intervals of 20 feet to 150 feet. Other uniformed and plainclothes guards stood in clusters, on rocky outcrops and among the trees and thickets. The security was a reminder of the region's potential for violence. Both <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Sri Lankan President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> have escaped unhurt from assassination attempts in their capitals, while <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> was the target of an unsuccessful coup less than two months ago. Another participant, former Gen. <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1982, although a yes-or-no referendum subsequently proclaimed him president. The other summit participants, King <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and King <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangchuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, rule through hereditary succession. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s avenue to power through popular election followed the death of President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, who in 1977 overthrew her father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was subsequently convicted in a murder case and executed. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 35 others were killed Aug. 17 in an explosion that destroyed their aircraft over <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Officials blamed sabotage but could not say who was responsible for downing the plane.

 A senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official today marked the 10th anniversary of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> appeal for peaceful reunification with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> by renewing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s proposal for direct talks with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Nationalist government `` We hold that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Kumomintang -LRB- Nationalists -RRB- should establish contacts and start negotiations at an early date on the basis of equality,'' Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> said. `` We can talk about the reunification of the country, or carry out consultations on the concrete issues concerning the relations between the two sides.'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> was speaking at a forum of 300 senior party and government leaders held to commemorate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` message to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> compatriots'' issued on Jan. 1, 1979. The message called for the peaceful reunification of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with the mainland and proposed direct transportation and postal links as a first step toward easing tensions between the two nations. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in a report on the forum, said the 1979 message signified a historic turning point in relations between the mainland and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has since then called for direct political and trade contacts and has said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> can keep its current political and economic system if it rejoins the mainland. The Nationalists, who fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after their defeat to the communists in 1949, have rejected all proposals for direct contacts with the mainland. However, in the past year the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government has eased travel and trade restrictions with the mainland. More than 400,000 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents have traveled to the mainland in the past year, and indirect trade is estimated at $ 2.4 billion in 1988, up from $ 1.5 billion in 1987. `` Such changes are in accordance with people's wishes and the overall tendency of this historic development is therefore irreversible,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said. He also expressed concern about Taiwanese advocates of independence and those on the island who are in favor of `` two Chinas'' or `` dual recognition'' concepts. Reunification is in the interests of both sides, he said. `` This will not only help the whole country to quickly become prosperous, but will also help maintain sustained development on the island, which can then enjoy the prestige of the great motherland.''

 Three-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> hesitated only briefly when his mother awoke him and asked for help that may have saved her life. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, 29, said Thursday she began feeling sick Tuesday afternoon and woke up early Wednesday morning in severe pain and paralyzed, hemorrhaging from a ruptured fallopian tube. She called to <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, who was sleeping on the couch, and in a barely audible whisper urged him to telephone for help. At first <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> stood in disbelief, and assured her she could go to the doctor the next day. After convincing her son that she could n't wait, Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> made a zero out of her thumb and index finger and the youngster followed her instructions to dial the number, she said. `` I told the operator, I told her that my mommy was sick and that she wanted daddy to come home,'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> recalled. When the operator asked where <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> worked, the pre-schooler said he replied: `` Arkla Gas. In the ` puter room. The operator, who the Pendletons still are hoping to identify, telephoned <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> and notified <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, who summoned an ambulance to their home. Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> handled the telephone conversation like a pro. `` He never got nervous,'' she said. `` He was just as calm as though I asked him to do it all the time.'' There was every reason to panic. Doctors said Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> had lost three pints of blood and was close to death. `` If I'd have laid there much longer, I'd have been gone,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, who is expected to return home from <ORGANIZATION> Schumpert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in three days.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in another step designed to reduce the chance of air sabotage, soon will propose a computerized security system to tighten control over access to planes, the agency's director said today. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the agency has drafted a proposed rule that would require workers to carry a computer-coded card that would be coded to allow only authorized employees near aircraft during maintenance and servicing. He was not specific as to when the proposal would be released. In addition, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive issued Thursday governing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline flights from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> called for `` very dramatic restrictions'' on access to baggage once it is inspected. `` Not only the passenger will not have access, nobody will,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' The directive issued Thursday will require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to look inside every checked bag, by eye or X-ray, at airports in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Passengers should expect longer check-ins, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. The stepped-up security comes in the wake of the bombing of the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. The carriers also will have to make random visual inspections of a percentage of hand baggage, with the bag being emptied and the empty bag X-rayed, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said he was `` not at liberty'' to say what percentage of hand luggage would be inspected or how it would be selected. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told reporters the stricter security measures `` are based on the practices of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> _ the best in the world,'' and `` far exceed existing international standards.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, the Israeli airline, has never had a bombing aboard one of its aircraft. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> did not mention some El Al practices, such as the testing of baggage in a decompression chamber and the close questioning of passengers about their personal lives. In 1986, an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> guard questioning a passenger, the unsuspecting girlfriend of a terrorist, found a bomb in hand luggage at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the new rules would take effect in 48 hours. Much of the new routine already is in place but is n't required to be followed all the time, he said. `` The balance between security precautions and passenger processing has been basically upset,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. Asked why similar new measures were n't being required in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he replied, `` The threat appears to be more international in scope. We are encouraging our carriers to be more vigilant domestically.'' At the 103 airports affected in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the new precautions `` may well result in passenger delays and inconvenience,'' such as `` check-in earlier, perhaps as much as an hour.'' President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, vacationing in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Thursday, threatened retaliation against the bombers of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did this _ if you can ever find them.'' But the vice president refused to discuss specifics of retaliation, and he said it was unlikely terrorism could ever be stopped completely. `` It is almost impossible to guarantee there will never be another terrorism act,'' he said, though he suggested improved intelligence and cooperation between nations. Here are the other principal provisions of the new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requirement: _ Parcels shipped through passenger ticket counters also must be X-rayed or physically examined _ Passengers may not have access to checked baggage, and additional measures will be required to keep other people from unauthorized access <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> did not say what they would be. _ Airlines must make a `` positive match'' of checked baggage to actual passengers, keeping unaccompanied bags off the plane If a passenger leaves at an intermediate stop, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of civil aviation, the passenger's baggage would have to be taken off in accordance with the already required `` reconciliation at the transfer gate'' of the passenger and baggage manifests. _ The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is accelerating by six months the delivery of thermal neutron analysis devices which are capable of detecting all known explosives, even those that are transparent to X-rays such as the plastic explosives favored by terrorists Under the accelerated program, the first unit will be in operation next summer and the last of five, perhaps six, will be operational by the beginning of 1990. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said it had not been decided where to place the thermal neutron equipment. _ The agency's security inspection staff will be increased by 35 percent, from 550 people to 670, over the next 20 months <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the agency believed training of airline security employees was adequate. She said the agency had no estimate of what its new requirements would cost the airlines. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers, said the airline industry will comply fully with the new security initiatives. `` However, more must be done than simply placing additional security requirements on the airlines,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` The government itself must become more directly involved in meeting the threat that international terrorism presents. `` We believe the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should assign more of its security personnel to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. And we believe the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should impose the same security requirements on foreign airlines which serve the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as it imposes on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines,'' he said.

 Here are some facts about <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LAND _ <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> covers 98,766 square miles, slightly larger than <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. It a federation of six republics: <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, including the autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bosnia-Hercegovina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>. The capital is <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> occupies the western part of the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, with a long coast on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. About half the country is mountainous. A rich plain in the north and northeast, drained by the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION>, is the most fertile area. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is bordered by <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the north, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> in the east, and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> in the south.

<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s population of just over 23 million includes about 30 different nationalities. Serbs account for about 36 percent and the Croats for about 20 percent of the popoluation. Other Slav groups are the Slovenes, 8 percent; and the Montenegrins, 3 percent. Ethnic Albanians, who live mostly in the tense province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, make up 9 percent of the population. An ethnic category known as Moslems accounts for another 9 percent. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s ethnic diversity has been a source of strife for centuries. The official languages are <LOCATION> Serbo-Croatian </LOCATION>, Slovene, and Macedonian. An estimated 41 percent of Yugoslavs are Orthodox, 32 percent Roman Catholics and 12 percent are Muslims.

 THE ECONOMY: After President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s death in 1980, the economy has deteriorated sharply, revealing the shortcomings of the `` self-management'' system officially giving workers the say in running enterprises. In practice, Communist-dominated state planning and widespread corruption have caused serious problems. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> now has a $ 21 billion foreign debt, 250 percent inflation and 15 percent unemployment. Mounting worker discontent has led to more than 1,000 strikes in 1988.

<TEXT>
 HISTORY: For about five centuries, much of the land that is modern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was under Ottoman rule, shaken off in 19th century uprisings. In December 1918, a Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, including <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hercegovina </LOCATION>, was formed. During World War II, the Nazi invaders were fought both by royalists and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> partisans under <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who then became <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s undisputed postwar leader. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> broke with Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1948, and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> became a nonaligned communist country. Some of its present problems are attributed to the system bequeathed by Tito, including annual rotation of key offices and a weak federal authority. The state-run press and Yugoslavs themselves have become increasingly outspoken and liberal as the mounting social and economic problems have dented the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> and his entire Cabinet quit today in the first resignation by a federal government since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took power after World War II. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he stepped down because it refused on Wednesday to pass an economic law needed to ensure continued support from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for the debt-ridden country. The resignation could signal further liberalization of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s one-party system as the ethnically divided country struggles to solve unprecedented social and economic woes. Mikulic represented a hard-line faction within the party and his resignation indicated that more reform-oriented forces are gaining the upper hand in the party leadership. But the resignations also represent an attempt to shift blame for the crisis away from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the premier and his 31-member Cabinet. Parliament and the nine-member federal presidency now will likely consult on who will form a new government. In his speech, broadcast live on <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> refused to accept blame for the country's economic problems, including a $ 21 billion foreign debt, 15 percent unemployment and annual inflation of 250 percent. After the 35-minute speech, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> refused to take up an option to discuss the resignation, in effect accepting it. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic problems were inherited `` from past decades'' and that it was unrealistic for his government `` to resolve them in only two and half years.'' <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> began a four-year term after succeeding <PERSON> Milka </PERSON> <PERSON> Planinc </PERSON> as premier in May 1986. `` It is more honorable for the government to resign than to be blamed for all of the country's ills,'' <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said. In recent days, leading politicians criticized the government's economic policies and state-run dailies had called for Mikulic's immediate `` Poisonous arrows are being aimed at the government,'' <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said. He said the Cabinet decided to resign after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday refused to pass a law that would have imposed curbs on public spending. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said the law was needed to ensure continued support from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that agency insisted on austerity measures limiting public spending before agreeing in June to grant <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> a one-year standby credit of $ 416 million. About $ 260 million of that credit has been used, according to official estimates. The loan was crucial to help <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> meet payments on its foreign debt and reach separate agreements for loan rescheduling with other Western banks and governments. The Communist Party daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister as saying <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to pass the law `` destroys the standby arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> ...'' In a bid to overcome the deteriorating situation, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted a new law Thursday to stimulate private enterprise, liberalizing rules for establishing private businesses. The law was adopted `` for the first step toward market economy,'' the state news agency said. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has had a record number of strikes this year, with workers protesting low wages and declining living standards. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> survived a potential vote of confidence in May, when deputies from the liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> failed to gather support from the other four Yugoslav republics to vote out the government. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s reputation has been tarnished further by a corruption scandal involving hundreds of officials in his native republic of <LOCATION> Bosnia-Hercegovina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> also has been wracked by unrest among its various ethnic groups. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> is an economist who served as a presiding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 and 1979 under the late leader <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. Although he rejected blame for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic problems, observers said his decision to step down was at least partly intended to placate <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million citizens, who are increasingly angered by falling living standards. Although <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> has been accused of incompetence, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s complex federal system also has hindered a solution to its economic problems The need for unanimity by the country's six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces on all federal matters means that key decisions are often watered down to ineffective compromises.

<TEXT>
 A caller claiming to represent the Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, which last week said it blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, telephoned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news agencies today and threatened more action. The anonymous male caller repeated the claim of responsibility and said that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deports <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, son of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` there will be another present in the New Year for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Speaking in a Middle Eastern accent, he read a brief statement to The Associated Press in broken English and hung up, refusing to answer questions. `` In the name of the God and Islamic revolution and <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, we are very pleased to succeed the Pan Am attack,'' he said. `` We are very concerned with the recent activities of the <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We demand <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to throw him out of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or else there will be another present in the New Year for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it received a similar call. An anonymous male caller telephoned the AP on Dec. 22, the day after the jumbo jet crashed in southern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and leaving 11 missing and presumed dead on the ground. British officials later concluded that a bomb downed the plane. He said it was in retaliation for the shooting down of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in July. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the plane was mistaken for an Iranian fighter. All 290 people aboard were killed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and terrorism experts said it was unlikely that the group actually was responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bomb. The group previously claimed responsibility for a July 1987 car bombing in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that wounded <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir-Parviz </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> resistance and a former <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister under <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, who was ousted in the 1979 Iranian revolution. The shah was denied permanent sanctuary in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and, suffering from cancer, shuttled with his family from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> before being granted asylum in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, where he died. The family moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984. His son <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, whom exiled supporters now call the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, lives at an estate in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, with his wife, <ORGANIZATION> Yasmine </ORGANIZATION>.

 Six current or former police officers were among 18 people indicted in a towing scam that allegedly bilked at least 600 people from 1982 to 1987, authorities said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 51, chief of the department's auto theft unit, was charged with six counts of conspiracy, perjury and writing a false police report, according to indictments returned Thursday by a <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury The suspects allegedly participated in several schemes to tow legally and illegally parked cars and overcharge owners when they came to retrieve them, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON>, a spokesman for District Attorney <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>. The grand jury handed up 1,500 charges in the indictments, which capped a two-year investigation. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> vowed to continue probing police corruption. `` The public should be outraged that a group of people conspired to literally take 600 to 800 cars off the street with no authority, in total violation of the rules and regulations,'' he said. `` I think it's time to look at the whole towing industry.'' Also indicted were three other police officers, one <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> police officer, one former police captain, two employees of the city's abandoned car division, two former inspectors at the state Registry of Motor Vehicles, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the owners of two city garages. The defendants face charges including larceny, concealing stolen motor vehicles, perjury, conspiracy and insurance fraud. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantin </PERSON>, 40, who was indicted on 535 charges, have been suspended without pay, police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Two other indicted officers, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, 44, were placed on administrative leave pending a departmental hearing, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said one alleged scheme profited from the different charges levied on cars towed by police and those towed by the <ORGANIZATION> Registry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, which charges more to drivers to retrieve cars. He said police would tow a car that was parked illegally but the defendants would tell the owner the car had been towed by the registry `` and pick up the extra money.'' Another scheme, <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said, would be to tow a legally parked car, and wait several weeks after the owner reported it stolen to collect daily storage charges _ often up to $ 600. The indictment does not say how much money was lost.

<HEAD>Woman Admits Plot to Overthrow Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A self-styled revolutionary admitted in federal court to taking part in bombings and bank robberies as part of a campaign to overthrow the government. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucier </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, 32, admitted Thursday to three of the charges she faces with four remaining defendants in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial that is scheduled to start Jan. 9. `` I want this over with. The evidence that convicted me in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> will convict me here,'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said at a two-hour hearing in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> court. `` I do not want to go through this again. I want to know what's ahead for me.'' Manning, already serving 15 years in her 1986 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> conviction on bombing charges, said she plans to seek her high school equivalency diploma and learn a skill in prison. She faces another 60 years in prison and $ 60,000 in fines on the latest charges. Manning pleaded guilty to racketeering, conspiring to racketeer and seditious conspiracy, but was allowed to invoke the <LOCATION> Alford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doctrine </LOCATION>, in which the defendant does not admit guilt but enters the plea to take advantage of a plea-bargain offer. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> fought <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s petition, saying there was no plea agreement and such a plea was not in the public interest, since it `` eliminates a potential avenue for discovering now-decaying and extremely usable dynamite'' that the group is alleged to have used. He argued that only some of 1,166 sticks of dynamite have been recovered. `` This would leave about 390 sticks of dynamite and water gel explosives and 84 blasting caps, at a minimum, unaccounted for.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> allowed the change in plea after ensuring that <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> knew which rights she was forfeiting. The three-count indictment charged her and the other four remaining defendants with engaging in a conspiracy to rob banks and bomb military offices, defense contractors and other institutions from 1976 to 1985. A <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> courthouse worker lost a leg and 21 other people were injured in one 1976 bombing. All but one of the defendants are serving jail sentences for previous convictions on other charges related to the bombings and robberies.

<TEXT>
 A Lebanese magazine today reported that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were negotiating secretly for the release of British hostages believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists. But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said on condition of anonymity that the report in the weekly Ash-Shiraa was `` absolute nonsense.'' The magazine, citing an unidentified `` well-informed source in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' said the talks were `` expected to result in the release of the British hostages soon.'' There was no independent confirmation of the report.

 A group of 23 Polish sailors has asked for political asylum after fleeing the same two vessels that brought 13 other <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> sailors who landed here in January with the same request. The latest group of sailors set foot here Tuesday after disembarking from the fishing trawlers <LOCATION> Kunatka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laskara </LOCATION>. On Thursday they began the formal process of applying for asylum. Some of the men carried shore passes as they entered the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in the city's <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section. They told patrons and staff that they wanted to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. City Hall officials and representatives of Polish-American groups met with the seamen to discuss the process. City immigration consultant <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON> interviewed them and prepared their asylum applications. `` They have to show they have well-founded fears of persecution if they were to return to their country,'' she said. Most of the men are married, and many have children. Hopeful that asylum will be granted soon, the men say they are also hopeful that they can be reunited with their families. The Polish sailors who jumped ship in January were granted asylum in April under a process the federal government considers expedited, Ms. <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who has served in the Cabinet under three presidents, is among nearly a dozen people rumored to be in contention for the post of energy secretary in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> would fit the president-elect's desire for someone with a nuclear background to tackle the department's massive cleanup and modernization at its 17 weapons plants in 12 states. At least 10 other names still were circulating around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s rumor mills Thursday. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s was a new name as a possible selection, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office sources identified him as a top contender. Two other candidates, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and former congressman <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, also remained in leading contention. Now a consultant and staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary under President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and was dismissed from that job President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. His resignation was one of a handful President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> accepted in 1979 after demanding resignations from the entire Cabinet and top echelons of his administration. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who was traveling Thursday, was let go by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> because of budget differences and, according to one account, because he presumed to lecture the president, a congressional veteran, on how to deal with a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had known for decades. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> had the misfortune to be energy secretary when the Iranian revolution triggered gasoline lines in much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ lines many analysts, including the current secretary, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, believe were the result of price and allocation controls in effect at the time and no longer on the books. An economist, <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> has strongly supported nuclear power. When he was a member of the old <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, he took his family to witness a nuclear weapons test in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to show his confidence in the safety arrangements. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who represented a chemicals and refining-intensive district around <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, is a lawyer whose unsuccessful campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 was hobbled by the collapse of crude oil prices. He has campaigned for the secretary's job. His selection would be taken as a sign of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s concern for the domestic oil industry, which lost 150,000 jobs in the price collapse. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has no particular nuclear background, but got his start at <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> reviving the nearly abortive `` superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program in 1983, and presided over a quintupling of the program then and as administrator after 1985. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nuclear concern brought two Democratic names to the surface: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutch </PERSON>, undersecretary in <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s days at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and now provost of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and now chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Herrington </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Facility Safety. Other names mentioned are: _ <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON>, deregulation-oriented chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and former assistant energy secretary for administration _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the candidate backed by Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ Retiring Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who has been opposed by <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> _ Former Gov <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt.

 Israeli troops shot and killed three Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> over the last two days, the army said today. An army spokesman also said 1,194 Palestinian schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> will be shut for a week because of increased student violence. Two of the deaths in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> took place Thursday night in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Zeitoun </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. He said the two Palestinians were shot when they tried to escape after being ordered out of their house. The two were suspected of throwing firebombs, he said. `` They were ordered to come out,'' the spokesman said. `` Then they tried to escape and were shot.'' He said one suspect died at the scene, another died in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hospital and a third was captured unharmed. The violence continued today with one Palestinian killed and nine wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> as army-imposed curfews confined at least 160,000 Palestinians to their homes in refugee camps and towns. An Arab reporter said the army broke up a protest that followed noon Moslem prayers in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhhod of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said soldiers used clubs, rubber bullets and live ammunition. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalim </PERSON> <PERSON> Behid </PERSON>, 22, was shot in the lung during the disturbance and died at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Five Arabs were wounded by gunshots, and a 4-year-old boy was hit in the head with a rubber bullet. The army confirmed Behid was killed by army gunfire, and that four Palestinians were wounded in the Sheikh Radwan clash. `` After prayers, they raised the Palestinian flag and threw stones,'' the army spokesman said. He said troops opened fire to disperse the crowd. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, three Palestinians were wounded, among them a 35-year-old woman hit in the abdomen, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. In the <LOCATION> Jabalya </LOCATION> refugee camp, a teenager was wounded. The deaths raised to at least 342 the number of Palestinians killed in the year-old rebellion against the 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Fourteen Israelis have also been killed. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military administration announced a weeklong closure of all Palestinian schools because of `` numerous incidents of disturbances by students,'' a spokesman said. The measure, which takes effect Saturday, prevents about 300,000 Palestinian school students from attending classes. Schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were closed by the army Feb. 3 for nearly 10 months. Authorities gradually reopened the 1,194 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools in December but made studies conditional on a halt to student violence. Army officials say schools often become focal points for violent demonstrations in the uprising. For that reason, four universities and 16 junior colleges in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> have been shut indefinitely. Palestinians have protested the closure, with educators arguing that students were losing the discipline for study.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Official To Lose Car Rental Franchise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A car rental company said today it will take a franchise away from a member of a right-wing town council that has reinstated hard-line segregation laws. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Waal </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rent-a-Car </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that his company would sever its ties in February with <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, operator of a Budget franchise in <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> is a member of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won control of councils in <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION> and dozens of other towns in municipal elections on Oct. 26. The councils in <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, both industrial towns on the eastern edge of the greater <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> region, have reinstated `` whites only'' status at parks and other public facilities that had been opened to all races in recent years. The actions have been widely condemned, not only by anti-apartheid groups but also by the government. However, the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has given no indication it will repeal the Separate Amenities Act, which allows racial segregation of local facilities. `` We do not believe that Mr. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s views and those of his <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> colleagues represent the outlook of the silent majority of <LOCATION> Brakpan </LOCATION> voters,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Waal </PERSON>. `` While the separate amenities legislation that is being enforced was put in place by the government, it appears these measures were dying an evolutionary death until the stance taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' In another development, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, a politician who has irked the government with his defiant tactics, says he has accepted an invitation to attend the inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> told the annual congress of his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that he would attend the inauguration during a three-week trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He will miss the opening of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 1989 parliamentary session on Feb. 3. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls the mixed-race chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which also has chambers for whites and for Asians but excludes the black majority. Anti-apartheid activists criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for deciding to join the newly expanded <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, but in the past 18 months <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward the government. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Germany Seeks To Avoid Trade War Over Hormone-Treated U.S. Meat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today to avoid an all-out trade war in a dispute over hormone-treated meat. But the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> should not reconsider its refusal to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat products containing growth hormones, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Westdeutscher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio. He said the ban `` is not any form of discrimination because the same rules apply to all of us, and the decision is based on health policies.'' American officials are threatening to impose $ 100 million worth of trade sanctions on European food products starting Sunday because of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to accept American meat containing growth hormones. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said on Tuesday that the sanctions, which would effectively double the price of European food imports, would go into effect unless the meat restrictions are lifted. The use of growth hormones on livestock is prohibited in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, although a number of scandals involving illegal hormones have rocked the meat industries of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other European nations in recent months. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> urged that no countermeasures be undertaken by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions are imposed. He said the two sides should try to resolve their disagreement through the framework of the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> should try to defuse the dispute in talks with the American government at the same time. European and some American consumer groups say the hormones, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers use to make cattle grow faster, are hazardous to human health. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says the quantities are miniscule compared with the amounts of the same hormones produced by the human body. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approves only three kinds of hormone treatment _ estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. It banned diethyl stilbestrol, or DES, 10 years ago after it was proven to be cancer-causing. Use of DES by European cattle growers led to a scare for Italian consumers in 1980, when hundreds of children showed signs of early sexual development such as breast growth. Residues of DES were also discovered in residents of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, prompting a consumer movement that led to European-wide legislation against hormone-treated meat.

 A plaque marking the apartment house where <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> lived for 30 years was gone this morning, one day after a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> directive struck a new blow at the legacy of the disgraced Soviet leader. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced Thursday that the names of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and a later leader, <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>, will be expunged from every town, school and factory christened for them and even from their former homes. The decision was the latest attack on the 18-year legacy of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. It added <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to condemn the corruption and stagnation of their rule The plaque at 26 <LOCATION> Kutuzovsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who lived there until his death in 1982, a distinguished figure of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government and the world socialist and workers' movement. At the opposite end of the building, a tray under a plaque to <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s successor and a mentor to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, was full of artificial roses and tulips. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet parliament and the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, `` decided to drop the names of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> from all factories, administrative regions, institutions of learning and organizations named after them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In addition, memorial plaques will be removed from the houses where they lived,'' it said. `` The latest decision was in response to numerous letters and appeals to central party and state agencies and to newspapers.'' An announcement read on the evening TV news show <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name will be removed from a factory and region of the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s power base, and from a scholarship at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>'s name will be removed from towns in the republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, and from squares and streets in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. Renaming cities, neighborhoods, streets and factories is one of the ways Soviet officials have rewritten history in their 71 years in power, indicating which former officials and ideas are in favor. Many names associated with dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, his close associates and <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> have been removed in recent years. A movement also has developed recently to restore prerevolutionary names to many cities and areas. In January, authorities removed <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name from a city, town squares and a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood and blamed the former leader for fostering a period of cronyism and complacency. The city of <LOCATION> Brezhnev </LOCATION> about 500 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was returned to its previous name, <PERSON> Naberezhnye </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelny </PERSON>. The Soviet press increasingly has criticized <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who ruled from 1964 to 1982. Historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said a weakened and senile <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> ruled for six more years after being revived from a `` clinical death'' in 1976. In July, the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s survivors would be stripped of unearned privileges and left only with retirement benefits they earned with their own labor. <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> ruled only for 13 months after <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> and was ill most of the time. He died in March 1985, making way for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Few things were named for <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> after his death, indicating the low esteem in which he was held. In November, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced that a passenger liner that was to have been named for <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> would be given a different name.

 A group of former rose queens will take the second ride of their lives, getting carried in style in a horse-drawn carriage float in the 100th annual Tournament of Roses Parade. `` I can not believe I'll have the chance to relive the magic and excitement I experienced as rose queen 59 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsted </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthis </PERSON>, 80, who wore the 1930 crown. Some of the former queens who gathered for a luncheon honoring them Thursday will ride in a handcrafted carriage pulled by a matched team of black horses on a carriage float titled `` A Rose Queen is Forever.'' Parade officials said it was the first time such a group of former parade queens have been brought together to ride on their own float. This year's rose queen is <PERSON> Charmaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shryock </PERSON>, a 17-year-old <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> resident. The <ORGANIZATION> Westridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> senior is planning a career in communications. The parade's grand marshal will be <ORGANIZATION> Shirley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION>, who also led the parade 50 years ago when she was a 10-year-old film star. Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, star of such film classics as `` Heidi'' and `` Curly Top,'' made more than 40 films, sharing the spotlight with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>.

 A strong earthquake rocked the northeastern coastal city of <LOCATION> Jayapura </LOCATION> today, panicking residents but causing no serious damage, the official <LOCATION> Antara </LOCATION> news agency reported. The quake, measuring 5.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, occurred at about 9:30 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Antara </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the earthquake sent many city residents into a panic, particularly those working on the upper floors of tall buildings. <LOCATION> Antara </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Setianto </PERSON>, provincial chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the quake's epicenter was about 60 miles from <LOCATION> Jayapura </LOCATION>, the capital of <ORGANIZATION> Irian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaya </ORGANIZATION> province. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, the news agency said. An earthquake measuring 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause serious damage in populated areas. Every increase of one number in the scale indicates a tenfold increase in the magnitude of the quake.

 A gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty salon during a bungled robbery attempt had released all but one woman today as police sealed off a three-block area, authorities said. No shots were fired and no injuries were reported. The gunman negotiated undisclosed demands with police, Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> said. `` He is talking, so that's always a good sign,'' <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> said. The camouflage-clad man carrying a handgun took eight hostages at about 3 p.m. Thursday in the Possibilities beauty salon but soon released four people, including a young boy, police said. One woman was freed about 2:30 a.m. today and two others were released shortly after 8 a.m.. One woman remained in the salon, police said Authorities declined to say why the women were released, and did not release the names of the freed hostages or the woman still being held. Police Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> identified the gunman as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Police sealed off about three blocks in every direction. Residents wishing to leave or enter the area were being escorted by police, Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwald </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest who spoke with police about the gunman, said the man was `` not irritated.'' `` The man is not really upset.

 A truck cab plowed into a line of cars at the end of an expressway, causing a fiery, chain-reaction crash that killed four people and injured 10, police said. `` Apparently, ... the -LRB- truck -RRB- driver had been driving too many hours and fell asleep,'' said Master Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. The truck, driven by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Warrenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was in the northbound lanes where the Edens Expressway turns into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 41 in this northern <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb when the crash occurred at about 9 p.m. Thursday, <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> said. The stop light at the end of the expressway had just turned green, so the seven cars involved in the accident may have been moving a few miles per hour. The four people killed _ two men and two women _ were in the first car hit by the truck, <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> said. The identities of the victims have not been released. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleb </PERSON>, 31, a manager at <ORGANIZATION> Timbers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charhouse </ORGANIZATION>, a restaurant just west of the highway, said he saw the accident from the building where he works. `` The truck rolled over on top of two cars. It looked like a fire in the middle of the truck. At first it was small, but it grew very fast,'' he said. `` Flames engulfed two or three cars.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoxie </PERSON>, the general manager of the restaurant, said he helped rescue the truck driver. `` The driver kept saying, ` I hope they get out. I hope they get out,''' <PERSON> Hoxie </PERSON> said. Hall was in fair condition today at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> said. Another man was in fair condition with a rib fracture and eight others were treated and released. No charges had been filed in the case, <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>American Legion Recruiter Turned in Phony Registrations, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An American Legion commander allegedly signed up 200 phony memberships, including a former German soldier and several dead people, to win a Recruiter of the Year award, a newspaper reported. Costa <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, who was named the state Legion's top recruiter in June, may have bought his way to the top, according to a report detailed in Thursday's editions of The Orange County Register. A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page report signed Dec. 5 by state Cmdr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffanic </PERSON>. The state <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> awarded <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> its Recruiter of the Year award at its <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> convention after <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> submitted 801 new memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention. But the investigation found just 18 of the 801 applicants paid dues by check, while <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> wrote about 25 checks to the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> post for $ 8,250 from his own account. The report concluded, `` The question arises, was this an attempt to simply buy a large roster of members? If so, it would constitute an ominous attack on the integrity of The American Legion itself.'' It recommended charging <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> with violating the organization's rules by using `` unorthodox and erroneous'' recruiting methods <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> faces expulsion from the Legion, <PERSON> Steffanic </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, 67, declined to discuss the report. The investigation began after the Legion's national headquarters received inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the American Legion Magazine. The report said one of the letters was from a disabled man who had never served in the military, while another was from a man who had been a soldier in the German Army during World War II and was a prisoner of war in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Investigators found 205 apparent phony memberships, according to the report. Some of the people contacted did not know <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, and denied wishing to join or being eligible to join. Many were dead, the report said. The report said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was unable to explain why his membership applicants said they never agreed to join. To be eligible, applicants must have been discharged honorably from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and have served in World War I, World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> expanded its search today for six crewmen missing from a Bermuda-bound container ship that sank in rough seas and gale-force winds in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, leaving two seamen dead. `` We continue the search as long as there's a chance of finding them alive,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON> said Thursday night. `` We have n't found the second life raft'' from the ship. Three crewmen were plucked from the sea Thursday after the 254-foot <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> sank Wednesday night. A fourth was found dead and a fifth died on the way to the hospital. Two of the rescued men were transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <LOCATION> Tamaroa </LOCATION> and were helping searchers with information on what happened to their ship, <PERSON> Arbogast </PERSON> said. The victims were remembered at a ceremony today in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, as friendly men who went out of their way to help others. The <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON> had visited the port weekly. `` We are full of admiration for every one of the seafarers who have worked. ... We know how important the spirit of cooperation is to them,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Crafton </PERSON>, maritime chaplain and <LOCATION> Episcopal </LOCATION> priest. `` A seafarer is a brother to every other seafarer.'' At first light today, two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 airplanes, one <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 airplane, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> P-3 Orion airplane, two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jets, two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter joined the search, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharlacken </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> sank about 160 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> and 200 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> when its cargo shifted in weather that was `` nothing short of horrendous,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said there was hope for the missing crewmen because the ship went down on the edge of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, where warm currents mix with frigid <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> waters. Two of the rescued crewmen did not suffer serious hypothermia. The ship's captain was American and the crew was a mix of nationalities, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Meyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the ship's agent in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> The <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermuda </PERSON>, registered in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, made a run to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> every week, and had left <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Tuesday night with a cargo including food and building materials, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Powerful winds hit the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Wednesday as a cold front moved swiftly through the area and out to sea. Around 7:10 p.m., the ship's cargo shifted. The captain issued a distress call, then called back a few minutes later to say he was abandoning ship, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The ship capsized and began to sink within five minutes of the order to abandon ship, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, who spoke to one of the survivors. The men took to two life rafts. Rescuers began searching a 700-square-mile area for survivors but were hindered by heavy rains, 40 - to 45-mph winds and 25-foot seas Shortly after midnight Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet spotted three people in the water waving flashlights. Sailor aboard the merchant ship Eagle pulled two men from the water, but the third `` slipped from his life jacket, fell back into the water and was not seen again,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The two survivors were treated for mild hypothermia. Around 4 a.m., a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> frogman from a helicopter rescued two men drifting in the water without life rafts. They were flown to <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, but one man was pronounced dead, apparently of hypothermia, a hospital spokeswoman said. The other man, identified as <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Macio-Lopez </PERSON>, 35, was treated for hypothermia, spokeswoman <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. At first light Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot spotted what appeared to be a man waving from a life raft. But when rescuers reached the raft, they found nobody. Three hours later, rescuers spotted another man but, because of choppy seas and floating debris, could not get close enough to tell if he was alive. By the time a rescue helicopter reached him four hours later, the man was floating face down.

<HEAD>Contract Awarded For Databank On Medical Malpractice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials today announced the award of a $ 15.9 million contract to establish a nationwide data bank to store information on doctors and dentists who are either disciplined or sued for malpractice. The idea, contained in legislation passed in 1986, is to provide a way for hospitals and state medical licensing boards to avoid being duped by doctors and dentists who have run into trouble elsewhere and try to set up practice in a new state. Each state maintains its own licensing procedures and the legislation authorizing the data bank does not attempt to tell states who they should or should not license or hospitals who they should or should not hire. Information in the data bank will not be available to the general public. The intent is to wave a warning flag at state licensing boards and health facility employers so they can check further into a doctor or dentist's record and then make their own decision on the merits of each individual malpractice charge or disciplinary action. The five-year contract was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> UNISYS </ORGANIZATION>, an information systems company with corporate headquarters in <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The data bank is expected to become operational this coming summer. The contract calls for the project to receive $ 3 million in the current fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 30.

 An Iranian intermediary has approached the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offering to reopen diplomatic talks between the two countries, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is holding out for `` a substantive, up-front'' proposal, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Friday. `` It must come from someone in a position to make decisions,'' said the official in explaining why the department was cool to the offer, which was channeled through an Iranian-American professor. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the unidentified scholar, who teaches at a small college, was approached by an Iranian who has a low-level job in the foreign or justice ministry in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants seized and sacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy, taking the Americans there hostage. Most were held for 444 days before being released. Currently, there are nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, all held by a pro-Iranian group, according to the department's counter-terrorism office President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1985 secretly approved delivery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to encourage moderation in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government and also to try to facilitate the release of captive Americans. The Congressional and public uproar that developed when the purchases became known in 1986 prompted the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to insist on a public discussion with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` Given our past experience in dealing with people who purport to represent the Iranian government, it's clear we need to speak to someone openly and up-front, someone in an authoritative position,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. Several indirect overtures from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were received in the past and did not produce a substantive diplomatic dialogue between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is able to talk indirectly to the Iranian government through a number of foreign countries, including <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 A military tribunal today found the son-in-law of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> guilty of taking bribes and abusing his office, and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who served as first deputy interior minister during <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s years in power, systematically took thousands of rubles of bribes instead of enforcing Soviet laws, said the judge, army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Marov </PERSON>. The verdict came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> struck a further blow at the legacy of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, accused of fostering a period of corruption and stagnation, by ordering that a memorial plaque be removed from his former home and that all factories and schools still named for him be renamed. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> originally faced the death penalty in the sensational trial that began Sept. 5 on charges that he had accepted bribes of more than $ 1.1 million. But during the trial the court threw out some charges and reduced the amount of bribes he was accused of taking to $ 145,000. Prosecutors had recommended a 15-year sentence. The 52-year-old <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> in 1971, stood throughout the entire 3 -LCB- hour procedure at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, staring calmly at the judge and two lay assessors. He did not react to the announcement of the verdict and sentence, and declined to talk to reporters afterward. But his lawyer, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, said the court's decision showed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is on the way to a society based on law. `` You can agree or disagree with the sentence, but in substance the throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutors is indisputable,'' he said. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> was tried along with eight other former government officials from the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. One of the eight was aquitted and the case of another, former <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> Interior Minister <PERSON> Khaibar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyayev </PERSON>, was turned back to prosecutors for further investigation. <PERSON> Tashtimur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakhramanov </PERSON>, a former deputy interior minister, who was acquitted, took a seat in the audience after the court pronounced him a free man. He broke down and cried, and nurses clad in white came to assist him.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> paid a record $ 20.2 million fine today for failing to meet the government's fuel economy standard for its 1986 model luxury automobiles, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the biggest fine the government had ever collected for gas-guzzling cars. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the German manufacturer's 1986 models averaged 21.3 mile per gallon compared with the government standard of 26.0 mpg. Mercedes may be liable for an additional $ 5.5 million fine for the 1985 model year under a preliminary decision by an administrative law judge, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The company is allowed to appeal that ruling. In the 1985 model year, the requirement was 27.5 mpg and Mercedes cars averaged 23.6 mpg. Federal law requires manufacturers and importers to pay a $ 5 fine for every car sold that falls one-tenth of a mile per gallon below the government's standard. They may earn credits for surpassing the standard and apply the excess to model years that violate the rule. Mercedes had no credits for 1986. The $ 20,214,700 it paid was $ 235 a car for 86,020 cars. Credits reduced the 1985 liability from about $ 18 million, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. Telephone calls to the <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, office of the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary and its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers went unanswered

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native who came to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> almost 60 years ago said Friday he and his family had won their 13-year fight to leave, ending one of the most mixed-up Soviet emigration cases. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Gita </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, have been trying to emigrate since 1975. At one point in the battle, the family got as far as the entrance ramp of their plane when Soviet officials stopped them, claiming Mrs. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> had access to state secrets in her job as a chemist in a geology institute. `` There's no feeling yet. It's just a big mess thinking of all the things we have to do,'' the 77-year-old <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, a Jew, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They drag it out so long. It's been 13 -LCB- years. The main thing now is to try to be calm and not to forget anything, which is hard.'' <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> and his family plan to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but he said they did not know yet when they will leave. After settling in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said, the family will go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to visit friends. Resolution of the case was another in a series of Soviet moves under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to improve the country's human rights record. Many Jews who were refused permission for years have emigrated in the past year and a half. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a teen-ager in 1931 with his parents, who were Russian emigres and ardent communists. His father died in <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> was disenchanted with the country to which he came to help build the first communist power, but he was stuck. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> was called up to fight in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during World War II, where a Nazi grenade cost him the sight in his left eye. He later served as a translator and announcer for Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> holds <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship, as does his son by virtue of <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>'s birth and residence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The family was stripped of its Soviet citizenship in 1975. That was when they were stopped at the entrance ramp of their plane. For 10 years the Soviets refused to let Mrs. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> leave. Their belongings have remained in a warehouse in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ever since. In the mid-1980s the family received final permission to leave, but <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> had a new problem. His son's new wife, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, is a Soviet citizen and her mother refused to sign a financial waiver allowing her to go. The family refused to leave without <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, and mother and daughter have not been on speaking terms for many years. The <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> case has been high on the list of U.S.-Soviet human rights cases for years. Officials reported several times that it was solved, but new problems cropped up. `` I have news now,'' an excited <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said, starting his telephone conversation. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, who has a 2 -LCB- - year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son, said in an interview that the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials about five days ago that her mother finally had signed a release allowing her to go She said she called the Soviet Visa and <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, OVIR, on Friday, and that Deputy Director <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Karakulkov </PERSON> had confirmed that officials received the signed waiver. She said she expects to receive official notification in the next several days. `` I'm sure there was pressure on my mother,'' <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> said. `` They called her into OVIR several times.'' She said she did not know why her mother finally signed the release and `` in no circumstances'' would call her to find out. She said many Jews remain behind in `` hopeless'' situations because their relatives refuse to sign waivers permitting them to emigrate. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 29, said he had `` no special feelings.'' He said he worried about friends who want to emigrate but do n't have the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on their side, like his family did. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who met with <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, credited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the decision to allow <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` I've worked on hundreds of Soviet emigration cases over the years, and this has been the toughest and the most frustrating,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Makanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I do n't believe it would have been settled without President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s direct involvement. It's also a hopeful sign about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s struggle with his own bureaucracy. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> loves his hometown, and we're going to give him a grand tour when he comes back.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> has agreed to put <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> and his family up free of charge when he returns. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a boyhood dream was to stay a night and `` live like a king'' in the old <ORGANIZATION> Steven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, which is now the Hilton. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> told <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>: `` We're trying to make plans. We just want to find a small quiet town, someplace green, no hurly-burly. I hope I can find work.''

<HEAD>African Students Say Authorities Charge They Have AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NANKING, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Racial conflict between African and Chinese students was reported in another city Friday, and more than 60 Africans were sequestered in a dormitory to protest allegations by authorities that they have AIDS. The incident at the <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> took place against the backdrop of continued anti-black demonstrations in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, where Chinese students are demanding that African students involved in a Christmas Eve brawl be punished. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayuk </PERSON>, a student from <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, said the problems in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, 143 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, began Dec. 23 when a university operator started telling all incoming <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> callers to the foreign students dormitory that all African students were infected with AIDS. African students asked the university for an explanation but were not satisfied by a meeting with a university official, `` so we began our boycott,'' <PERSON> Ayuk </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, a school finance officer came to the dormitory and students locked him in the office of the gatekeeper, <PERSON> Ayuk </PERSON> said. The official escaped through a window at 5 a.m. Thursday after nine hours in captivity when the African students were asleep, he said. <PERSON> Ayuk </PERSON> said he believed the Chinese were prejudiced against all foreigners, but most strongly against Africans. He said the Africans had been given a nickname in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>: `` aizu bing,'' the Chinese words for AIDS. A student at the agricultural college from the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> was sent home in November after he tested positive for AIDS, but all the other African students have tested negative for the disease, <PERSON> Ayuk </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has so far escaped the AIDS epidemic, requires all foreigners who live in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to undergo a test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. An African student at <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, said police were not allowing other African students to leave the city. `` Today I wanted to go to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> but I was n't able,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dujo </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>. `` The police are preventing us from buying tickets.'' Another African said he believed the Chinese were using the fear of AIDS to restrict contact between Africans and Chinese. `` They ca n't stop the contact between us and the Chinese,'' said the student from <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We have many very good, deep friendships so what they're doing is using this to scare off the Chinese.'' <PERSON> Ayuk </PERSON> said hot water had been turned off in the dormitory and the canteen was closed. He said students were cooking in their rooms with what little food they had. There are an estimated 1,500 Africans from 40 nations studying at Chinese universities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has long provided scholarships for Africans in a show of solidarity with developing African states, but social tensions, which Africans attribute to ingrained racial prejudices against blacks, have on occasion erupted into violent incidents between the Chinese and the Africans. In <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> on Friday, about 140 African students continued to be held at a guest house of a chemical fiber factory outside the city. City authorities forced the Africans to the guest house Monday night, ostensibly to protect them from angry Chinese mobs. They have rejected the students' requests to leave <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. During demonstrations Saturday and Sunday, thousands of Chinese threw rocks at African students and destroyed property in their dormitory rooms. The Chinese have demanded the Africans be brought to justice for allegedly starting a fight on Christmas Eve at <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in which 11 Chinese were injured. <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Chunsheng </PERSON>, vice director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jiangsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, said Friday the incident was under investigation and that about seven African students would be punished. He said the Africans were not cooperating in the investigation. `` They've locked their doors in the guest house and we ca n't get in to talk with them,'' he said. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiju </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said on Thursday that no Chinese would be punished for the clash and subsequent anti-black demonstrations. As of Friday evening, the streets of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> were quiet for the first time since the initial clash Saturday. On Thursday, seven Africans and one student from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> left the <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> under police escort for the train station, where they traveled to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, said a student from the <LOCATION> Comoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. He would only identify himself by the name of <PERSON> Bourhane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bourhane </PERSON> said the Africans, from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, were not involved in the incident, but felt endangered in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and wanted either to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or study in another city.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Government Plan to Put 9,000 Blacks In Homeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge Friday blocked the government from proceeding with plans to place 9,000 rural blacks under the jurisdiction of a tribal homeland against their wishes. The ruling came hours after President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> issued a proclamation that the Braklaagte community would become part of the nominally independent homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> on Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> T.T. <PERSON> Spoelstra </PERSON> blocked immediate implementation of the proclamation and gave the government until March 7 to show why its plan should n't be invalidated. The leader of the Braklaagte community, Chief <PERSON> Pupsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebogodi </PERSON>, contended in court papers that his people faced hardship and discrimination if they were incorporated into <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. They live in a farming area about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. The community has voiced opposition in the past to the <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> government and has sought to retain South African citizenship because of advantages in seeking employment. Residents feared that if they were incorporated into <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, they would be victimized unless they became citizens of the homeland. The intended incorporation was part of the government's longstanding and controversial policy of locating various black ethnic groups in self-governing or nominally independent homelands to reduce the proportion of blacks to whites in the rest of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> This policy suffered major defeats in court twice in 1988. The country's highest court, the Appeal Court, ruled in April that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> acted without authority when he incorporated the 120,000-member community of <LOCATION> Moutse </LOCATION> into the adjoining, semi-autonomous homeland of <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. The incorporation provoked widespread violence in <LOCATION> Moutse </LOCATION>, where most residents do not belong to the <LOCATION> Ndebele </LOCATION> tribe that predominates in <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION>. In August, the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> provincial <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected a government plan to place <PERSON> Botshabelo </PERSON>, a vast black shantytown, under the jurisdiction of the Qwaqwa, an impoverished homeland 180 miles away. A three-judge panel said the merger would not promote the political development of <PERSON> Botshabelo </PERSON>'s estimated 500,000 residents. <PERSON> Zach </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON>, leader of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the attempt to excise Braklaagte from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` After the abject failure of the homelands policy during many years ... it is almost incredible that as 1989 opens, the government should yet again be forcing South Africans against their will to become inhabitants of one of these places,'' he said. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> is made up of seven separate pieces of territory in north-central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It has an estimated 1.7 million residents and covers 18,000 square miles. Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> appointed his second justice minister of the week Friday as his scandal-buffeted government lurched toward the end of what commentators are calling a gloomy year in Japanese politics. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had to reach outside the world of politics to name a new justice minister, picking <PERSON> Masami </PERSON> <PERSON> Takatsuji </PERSON>, 78, a former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice with experience in drafting legislation as a bureaucrat in the 1960s and 1970s. On Tuesday the prime minister appointed <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, a 76-year-old member of parliament, to the justice portfolio. But <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> lasted only 60 hours _ said to be a postwar record for short <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> tenure _ as it became known he had received donations for years from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is investigating on suspicion of bribery. At the root of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political gloom is the scandal involving the Recruit conglomerate, whose founder sold unlisted shares of a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and business leaders. The share prices more than doubled when they were publicly listed in 1986, and the holders made fat, tax-free profits when they sold. The Recruit scandal has been dubbed the top story of the year by Japanese media, rivaled only by the similarly downbeat story of the illness of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, who has been bedridden with intestinal hemorrhaging since Sept. 19. `` The year 1988 was an indescribably gloomy one for Japanese politics, and one that calls for much soul-searching,'' commentator <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Tada </PERSON> wrote in Friday's <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Times. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leadership `` is deeply tainted by money power. An editorial Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SHimbun </ORGANIZATION>, another newspaper, said the just-concluded session of parliament `` showed Japanese politics at its ugliest and most corrupt.'' As <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> gave up the justice portfolio Friday, some opposition leaders and analysts said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> should resign his entire government and call elections. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who had appointed <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> Tuesday along with a new Cabinet in a drive to restore public confidence in government, did not immediately comment on the major setback. Instead, the outgoing and incoming justice ministers spoke to reporters. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> apologized and said he had n't known until Wednesday that Recruit had been giving money to his political support organization since 1976. `` However, as minister in charge of clearing up the Recruit problem in the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration, which is trying to heighten trust in government, it is regrettable that I received donations from Recruit,'' he said. The scandal now has brought the resignations of 18 public figures _ including two <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members _ since it hit the front pages last summer. Business leaders, top bureaucrats and news media executives are among the casualties. After <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s donations from Recruit became known, three other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> also said the company had donated to them, making it apparent that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> would have to go outside his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to find a justice minister untainted by Recruit money. <PERSON> Takatsuji </PERSON>, who served on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from 1973 to 1980, said he had no connection at all to the Recruit firm. `` I do n't really have anything to say about Recruit,'' <PERSON> Takatsuji </PERSON> said. `` My attitude toward it is no different from that of the people in general.'' Public approval of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government has slumped badly since he became prime minister in November 1987. A <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper poll in December showed his approval had dropped from 30 percent to 18 percent, and a <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> poll showed his approval rating down to 35.9 percent from 54.8 percent three months earlier. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> himself has a Recruit link since an aide and a relative profited from shares in the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, but he says he was not personally involved. His popularity also has suffered from the railroading of a controversial tax reform through the Diet, or parliament. Some analysts expect <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will face further setbacks if there are arrests in the Recruit affair and as the opposition uses the scandal to try to block passage of the budget in the Diet. `` Since <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had advocated the importance of public consensus ... he and his administration should resign as public support goes lower,'' said <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuoka </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Komazawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Despite the polls, many analysts think the Japanese are inured to shady practices under the governing conservatives, who have held power for all the postwar years except for 10 months in 1947-48. `` The Japanese take it for granted,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalera </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think they may be rather blase about this.'' The pervasiveness of shady money was shown in a report issued Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which estimated that Japanese firms had spent $ 456 million in 1987 on such `` shady expenses'' as illegal political donations and back-door rebates to other firms. The figure was a record, up 24 percent from the previous high in 1984, the agency said.

<HEAD>Soviets Allow Lithuanian Bishop To Resume Duties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet government will allow Lithuanian Bishop <PERSON> Juliajonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Steponavicius </PERSON> to resume his official duties after nearly 28 years of internal exile, <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Steponavicius </PERSON>, appointed by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1957 as apostolic administrator for the Lithuanian republic's capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, was exiled to northern <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in 1961 for refusing to collaborate with Soviet authorities. The bishop has rejected Soviet invitations to return to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> because the offers did not permit him to resume his official duties as head of the city's archdiocese, according to an official of <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>'s Lithuania-language section. This latest offer is without restrictions, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The radio aired a broadcast in Lithuanian on Thursday night about the Soviet decision. The offer to <PERSON> Steponavicius </PERSON> comes just two months after the Soviets decided to return the <ORGANIZATION> Vilnius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, which was converted into a state art gallery in 1950, to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. To celebrate the cathedral's return, the first Mass at the cathedral in 30 years was held for 20,000 worshipers in October. A Lithuanian in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> with close contacts in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> said the permission for <PERSON> Steponavicius </PERSON> reflects both the Soviet government's need for popular support as it pursues its reform policies as well as `` pressure'' from popular ethnic movements that have been testing the Kremlin's tolerance President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of openness has allowed Lithuanians and their Baltic neighbors to air their frustrations about limits on religious practices under Soviet rule. About 3 million of the 4 million Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> live in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, which has a population of 3.5 million.

 A sophisticated device with two separate detonating systems is believed to have triggered the bomb that brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, killing 270 people, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The newspaper said crash investigators believe the first trigger was a barometric device set off by altitude. This activated the second trigger, an electronic timer, to make the bomb explode an hour later, it said. Terrorists developed the double detonator technique after some airports started putting cargo through pressure chambers that would detonate pressure-activated bombs before they got on the plane, The Times said. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, where the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight originated aboard a different plane, uses the pressure chambers, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. On Wednesday, The Times was the first to report that investigators concluded a bomb was responsible for the crash. The formal announcement was made hours later. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 crashed Dec. 21 in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, en route from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. All 259 people on board were killed and 11 people on the ground were missing and presumed dead. So far 241 bodies have been recovered. An anonymous male caller claiming to represent the Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, which last week said it blew up the plane, telephoned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news agencies in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today and threatened more action. He repeated the claim of responsibility and told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deports <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, son of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` there will be another present in the New Year for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Last week's caller said the group attacked the plane in retaliation for the shooting down of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in July. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and terrorism experts said it was unlikely the group was responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> explosion. As a worldwide hunt began for the terrorists who planted the bomb, passengers using American airlines at four British airports underwent questioning Thursday and had their baggage X-rayed in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> orders. British police today started security checks of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport. But a spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael-Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, said there were no indications of security lapses that could have allowed the bomb to be smuggled aboard at the airport. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, Scottish police, the British anti-terrorism squad and West German police also are investigating. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s airport security chief, <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanstein </PERSON>, said today that luggage handlers and other ground personnel were being checked. He did not elaborate. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered visual or X-ray inspection of all checked bags on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines at 103 airports in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the change `` far exceeds international standards'' and is based on practices of the Israeli airline <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION>, which has never had a bombing. Officials said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is rushing delivery of devices that are capable of detecting all known explosives, including plastic explosives. Check-ins proceeded smoothly at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but passengers were quizzed about who packed their bags, when they were packed, whether the bags had been out of their sight and whether strangers had given them parcels to carry. Their checked-in baggage was fed through X-ray machines and then bound with a tough plastic strip to prevent them from being opened en route to the planes. Some luggage was also hand-searched. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischacker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, who was catching a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he flew to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed. `` What worries me a lot is the fact that they did n't have all this then,'' he said, gesturing to the X-ray machine. The security directive was issued hours after Wednesday's disclosure that a bomb brought down the jumbo jet The security directive took effect at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airports near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prestwick </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The airplane's nose cone, which had lain in a field outside a church near <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, was moved today to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 The new government, grappling with its first crisis, has begun work on an economic program aimed at restoring public confidence in the shekel and ending a speculative run on the dollar. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was expected to ask the Cabinet on Sunday to approve the outlines of an economic recovery plan that will be the most comprehensive since the emergency anti-inflation program of 1985, analysts said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported Friday that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was considering a $ 600 million cut in government spending, an increase in fees for government services, a reduction in subsidies for food and other necessities, and an end to automatic cost-of-living salary increases for workers. The Cabinet also was expected to approve a further devaluation of the shekel, perhaps as much as 10 percent, the radio said. The new government, a coalition of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that is similar to the previous government, was installed Dec. 22. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is the former foreign minister. The government has spent the past week trying to stem a massive buying binge of foreign currencies by the public and large financial institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, on Tuesday devalued the shekel 5 percent by adjusting the exchange rate to 1.680 shekels to the dollar from 1.599 shekels. On Friday, the central bank halted all foreign currency trading to stop further speculative buying. The markets are expected to reopen Tuesday after the New Year's holiday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, the bank's governor, predicted on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that once the new economic program is adopted, `` the public will calm down and the markets will stabilize.'' In the three days before trading was stopped, Israelis responded to rumors of an impending devaluation by purchasing $ 285 million worth of foreign currencies, mostly dollars. They apparently hope to sell at a profit after the shekel is devalued. The Israeli economy faces other major problems, including an industrial slump, rising budget deficits and inflation approaching 20 percent a year. <PERSON> Efran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, chairman of the economics department at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, noted that when the government introduced its last emergency program in July 1985, prices were rising at an annual rate of 440 percent or more. `` We do n't have hyper-inflation anymore,'' he said. `` But the government's idea now is the same _ not to do things unilaterally but to get some kind of agreement, a social contract.'' This will require support from <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's massive labor federation, which represents about 80 percent of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s workforce But Histadrut General-Secretary <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessar </PERSON> said Friday that workers ca n't be expected to relinquish their cost-of-living guarantee unless they are assured of other compensation. Union workers now get automatic pay increases equal to about 70 percent of the inflation rate. But he added, `` This does n't mean we do n't want to be partners in a comprehensive plan.''

<TEXT>
 Air terrorism has spawned a grisly `` arms race'' between the security establishment and the ever-increasing sophistication of the terrorist arsenal. As bomb-detection machinery has grown more refined, explosives have become easier to conceal. As one security gap closes, terrorists find another. Because of lack of personnel and the expense of operating X-ray equipment, `` we are always at least two steps behind the terrorists,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orrell </PERSON> of the British flight engineers' union said Friday, eight days after a bomb blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and leaving 11 on the ground missing and presumed dead. But other experts say the quest for terrorist-proof air travel has reached an outer limit beyond which it will become prohibitively expensive or make flying unbearably uncomfortable. When air terrorism became a problem in the late 1960s, authorities responded by transforming airports into fortresses. It now is routine for all passengers to go through metal detectors while their hand luggage is X-rayed. Airlines especially at risk, such as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION>, search all luggage by hand. At <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> airports, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> terrorist threat makes it necessary to frisk not just the passengers but everyone else coming into the terminal. Airlines insist that each piece of luggage match its passenger, assuming that no bomber would travel aboard the targeted plane. So terrorists have resorted to duping unwitting passengers into carrying explosives onto planes. Passengers are regularly warned to accept no baggage they have n't packed themselves. The search for suspicious objects has become much harder with the advent of plastic explosives that give off virtually no detectable odor. They are malleable enough to be shaped into a souvenir or rolled wafer-thin to fit inside a suitcase lining. Detonators now are small enough to fit into a suitcase lock. Moreover, the age of the metal-free handgun is looming. According to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, such a gun has been developed in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and will be extremely hard to detect on X-ray screens. `` The sophistication and miniaturization of explosives has become quite worrisome,'' <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON> said in an interview. According to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON> of the respected journal Flight International: `` It's an arms race.'' Bombs can be connected to barometric detonators that respond to altitude changes. Airports have hit back by putting baggage through simulated pressure to set off such bombs in safety. The terrorists, in turn, have come up with a double-device: the pressure detonator goes off safely, but it activates a second timer that will detonate the bomb in the air. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that this method was believed to have been used on Flight 103. <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON> is optimistic that within two years, a highly advanced explosives detector will become operational. Now being tested in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laboratories, the machine bombards objects with thermoneutron rays that detect telltale nitrogen vapors. But to cover the vast amount of baggage moving through large airports, it will have to be small, mobile and able to distinguish explosives' vapors from those given off by aviation fuel, said <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON>. He said the biggest security hole now lies not in the terminals where passengers arrive to catch flights but on the tarmac where the planes are parked. Security, he said, is difficult to impose on the hundreds of airport workers swarming about the tarmac. Many of the menial jobs are held by low-paid immigrants who are vulnerable to bribery and whose background is unverifiable in a security screening. `` We can put all the screens in place to check passengers and luggage, but there's still the problem of direct access to aircraft by people who are there to clean planes, fuel them and put food aboard,'' he said. The weapons used in the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner by Iranian extremists this year were probably smuggled aboard in catering trolleys in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON> said. `` A huge amount can still be done for security, but the fact that it's possible does n't mean it's feasible,'' <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> is unique, he said, because `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a nation operates in some respects under siege, under military conditions, and all its citizens accept that. So its airline has to act in many respects like a military operation.'' El Al passengers have to check in three hours before takeoff, their baggage is hand-searched, and the slightest irregularity in a travel document can mean a polite but lengthy interrogation about the passenger's origins, work, family, friends and purpose of travel. If another airline used such tactics on passengers, <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON> said, `` I suspect they would n't keep on flying with you for very long.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> has never had an aircraft bombed. But an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 was hijacked over Italian airspace by three armed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> on July 23, 1968. All passengers and crew were freed over several days after the plane landed in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>.

The children's mother, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, five Belgians and a baby sister born in captivity remained in the hands of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, backed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> The group, suspected in numerous cases of terrorism, accused them of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Doctors at a <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> hospital said Friday the girls were in good physical and psychological health. The children and their father attended the town party in <LOCATION> Ollioules </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION>, before leaving for a vacation at an undisclosed location. The French press welcomed the return of Marie-Laure and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>. But it gave equal space to what the conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> called `` nausea'' at the motive for the release. `` At the close of this ignoble drama ... there remains an after-taste of bitterness,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> `` today wants to play the role of Father Christmas.'' The girls' freedom is widely viewed here as <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s effort to boost his image at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, alleging <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has a chemical weapons plant, issued threats of a military strike. `` This gesture by the colonel is not gratuitous when, once again the object of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> threats, he urgently needs to fine-tune his image as a ` reasonable' man of state ...'' commented the daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>. The press also noted a renewed effort by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to improve relations with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which reduced diplomatic activity with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in April 1986. French officials said no conditions were made for the the release of the girls. The only exchange, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> quoted officials as saying, was allowing <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to make a nice gesture. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve. Once freed, Fatah-Revolutionary Council, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said the girls were a `` gift to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'' from the children of the year-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. They were taken captive Nov. 8, 1987, when the Silco, a sardine trawler turned yacht, was seized off the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to the captors' announcement. There have been reports the boat was actually seized off the coast of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, highlighting the mystery that has surrounded the hostages from the start. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> quotes French intelligence sources as suggesting the Belgian hostages may never have left <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and that the girls may have arrived there long before the official announcement Thursday. The hostages, who have received little public attention over the past year, have been referred to in the French press as the `` forgotten hostages.'' The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian factions. They include nine Americans. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who was abducted March 16, 1985.

 A semi-truck driver was arrested today after he raced through morning rush hour at speeds up to 90 mph, ramming his rig into at least 25 other vehicles, police said. At least two people were seriously injured. `` People said he was just pushing people off the road,'' a police dispatcher said. Sheriff's deputies chased the Peterbilt tractor-trailer rig for about 30 miles before he pulled into a rest area on Interstate 35 near <LOCATION> Devine </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. A group of citizens there surrounded the driver until officers arrested him. Police found a small amount of cocaine in his rig, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> trooper <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Milikien </PERSON>. The man was taken to the <LOCATION> Medina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail in <LOCATION> Hondo </LOCATION>. The first hit-and-run incident was reported shortly after 8 a.m. on Interstate 10 near Comfort in <LOCATION> Kendall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> trooper <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON>. The trucker sideswiped a vehicle driven by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Etlinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boerne </LOCATION>, who was run off the road.

The trucker `` was running between 85 and 90 and he -LRB- Etlinger -RRB- could n't catch him,'' <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON> said. The truck eventually hit at least 18 cars in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and seven elsewhere, police said. Many vehicles were sideswiped and rear-ended.

<HEAD>Mercedes-Benz Pays Record $20.2 Million Fine for 1986 Gas-Guzzlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> has paid a record $ 20.2 million fine because its 1986 cars guzzled too much gasoline, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The luxury German automaker was fined because the 86,020 cars it sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1986 model year fell 4.7 miles per gallon short of meeting that year's required fleet average minimum mileage, 26.0 mpg, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, spokesman for the agency. The law requires a fine of $ 5 for every tenth of a mile per gallon that the standard is missed _ $ 235 a car in this case _ times the number of cars sold. Manufacturers may apply credits earned by doing better than the minimum in other years, but Mercedes exhausted all its credits in the 1985 model year. An administrative law judge has proposed to fine the company about $ 5.5 million for 1985, when the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet averaged 23.6 mpg and the requirement was 27.5 mpg. Without credits, the 1985 fine would be nearly $ 18 million, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The largest previous fine was $ 8.8 million paid by <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 for shortfalls in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> also paid about $ 6 million in 1986 for 1984 cars. Porsche paid $ 1.25 million in 1987 for 1985 cars, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. Several smaller fines have been imposed, but he said he did not have details at hand. Mercedes has 10 days to appeal the proposed 1985 fine, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. There was no answer Friday at the <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, offices of the company's <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> subsidiary, and no one at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of its lawyers could answer questions. In addition to the fleet average requirement, cars sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also are taxed if they fail to meet a different minimum standard. The current fleet average requirement is 26.5 mpg, and <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> is considering where to set the benchmark for cars that go on sale next fall for the 1990 model year. Individual cars carry an excise tax for falling short of 22.5 mpg. The tax starts at $ 500 and reaches $ 3,850 for cars that fail to reach 12.5 mpg. Some Mercedes models are subject to the tax.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> today denied a request for clemency from the woman convicted in the 1980 murder of <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION> Diet author Dr. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 65, is serving 15 years to life for the slaying of her lover. Friends and relatives of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a former headmistress at an exclusive <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> girls' school, had mounted a petition appeal campaign on her behalf. They said as many as 10,000 letters had been sent to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and that they had delivered petitions containing 25,000 signatures seeking clemency for her. Neither <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' lawyer nor family members could be reached immediately for comment today. Other than to say clemency for <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had been denied, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> declined to discuss the matter. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has always maintained she meant to kill herself and not <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON> on March 10, 1980, when she drove to his house just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from her home at the <ORGANIZATION> Madeira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Upset because he had taken up with a younger woman, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> wound up shooting <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON> four times. She said the shooting was an accident. The governor today granted clemency to two state prison inmates, <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasgonez </PERSON>, who were serving 15 years-to-life sentences on drug sale charges. In a statement issued with his clemencies, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vasgonez </PERSON> were the only two inmates recommended unanimously, or even by a majority of the lawyers who reviewed the clemency requests for him. Inmates denied clemency can reapply after waiting one year.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the offspring of leaders who helped feed the bitter feud between their nations, were `` getting along famously'' on Friday, sources said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who took office four weeks ago, met <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> for the first time Thursday when he arrived in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> for a seven-nation <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> summit that has been overshadowed by meetings between the leaders of the region's two mightiest powers. The two held a second private meeting Friday, and Indian sources said the talks were friendly and productive. `` Their talks have been very warm, very cordial,'' an Indian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said there was hope for `` a new face on the relationship between the two countries, one of warmth, trust and confidence.'' Another Indian source said: `` They're getting along famously.'' Pakistani officials declined comment on the talks. Before <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Saturday, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are expected to sign three agreements, including one in which the countries agree not to attack each other's nuclear installations, Indian sources said. The others provide for cultural exchanges and an end to double taxation in trade and commerce. The signings appear to be largely symbolic and designed to emphasize hopes that new leadership in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will lead to better relations with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The cultural and taxation agreements were initialed about a year ago by both countries. A verbal agreement on the nuclear non-attack pact was reached three years ago during a visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, the army general who overthrew Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in 1977. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was subsequently executed after being convicted of what he said was a trumped-up charge of conspiracy to murder a political opponent. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was among those killed Aug. 17 in an explosion that destroyed an aircraft over <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s first private meeting began at 9 p.m. Thursday and lasted until 1:30 a.m., Indian sources say. The only other people present were Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s husband, businessman <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>. On Friday, the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers attended an all-day session with the leaders of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> as part of the fourth annual summit of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> then met again for more than two hours. They were joined midway through the meeting by their foreign ministers, <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The talks `` covered the whole gamut'' of problems between the nations, including disputes in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the Indian official said. In the last five years, <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> has been the scene of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s worst violence More than 2,400 people were killed in the border state this year by Sikh separatists. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> aids the extremists. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies this. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother and immediate predecessor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, was killed by two of her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984, four months after she ordered an army raid on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, where Sikh militants were holed up. More than 2,000 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed. The <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> border dispute dates back to 1947 when Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were partitioned along religious lines. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> claims a portion of the region lying in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Indian official declined to give any details of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s discussions, but said the leaders did more than outline problems but discussed `` what we will be able to do about them.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is to meet again with Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on Saturday. Other participants in the summit are President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Maymoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and King <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangchuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>.

 A group of 44 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> freed by <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> rebels say they were tortured during their captivity in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party newspaper said Friday. The prisoners arrived Thursday in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under tight government control. Only the party newspaper Barricada, the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diaro </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> TV were allowed to cover their arrival. Another 60 prisoners freed by the U.S.-backed rebels refused to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. They chose to remain in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> while seeking permission to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said the 60 were `` false prisoners'' and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaro </PERSON> described them as `` mercenaries'' staging a Contra-directed propaganda `` show.'' Both <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaro </PERSON> said they interviewed some of the 44 who came home. `` They subjected us to hunger, torture and all kind of outrage. They made me see death,'' Barricada quoted <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> <PERSON> Matute </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaro </PERSON> reported that 15-year-old <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Orozco </PERSON> said he was tortured `` with electric prods on my feet and used like a punching bag.'' It said the Contras accused the youth of being a Sandinista spy. Red Cross officials brought the prisoners across the border Thursday, six days after the Contras freed them under pressure from the Honduran government. The rebels say the prisoners were captured a year ago in combat in the Nicaraguan provinces of Chontales, <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Madriz </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have not said whether the freed prisoners included members of the armed forces. Meanwhile, the government said nothing about the latest <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> proposal for a new round of peace talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> beginning Jan. 25. An uneasy truce has been in place in the 8-year-old war since March. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the Contras in February. About 10,000 rebels, the bulk of the fighting force, fled to base camps just across the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> border, where they have been supported by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will begin next week a $ 200 million loan guarantee program for rural businesses that suffered from the 1988 drought and other weather disasters. Acting FmHA administrator <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said the program was authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1988 Disaster Assistance Act. New regulations carrying out the program will be put into effect on Jan. 3, although they will have a 60-day period for public comment. <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said the agency `` can make any changes that may be necessary after the 60-day comment period is over.'' Meanwhile, he said, many rural businesses are in need of assistance. The maximum loan amount is $ 500,000. Under the program, FmHA can guarantee up to 90 percent of a loan `` to help alleviate financial distress caused, directly or indirectly, by drought, hail, excessive moisture or related conditions'' that occurred in 1988, he said. The program will be similar in most respects to the existing FmHA business and industrial, or B & amp; I, guaranteed loans. The loans will be made by regular commercial lenders at negotiated interest rates, with <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> guarantees providing protection against loss should the loans fail. <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said the main difference is that the drought and disaster program will guarantee only the principal, while the <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; I program guarantees both principal and interest.

The owner of the restaurant, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> to pay him anyway. But the head of the lottery, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, said the prize will go to whoever presents the ticket. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> has offered a $ 100 reward, a sum several treasure hunters scorned as a `` miserable tip,'' according to the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> TV and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> showed pictures hundreds of people picking through the municipal garbage Thursday and Friday for the ticket. Dump employees said they burn trash every day and that it would be a miracle if anyone found it. But the treasure hunters seemed undeterred. `` It is worth making the effort,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, who is unemployed. The minimum wage in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is 8,000 cordobas a day, or about $ 1.70. A movie ticket or a pound of beef costs nearly half a day's wage and a pair of imported jeans costs 90,000 cordobas

 Some may call it a publicity gimmick, but <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> believes that revelers find his annual offer to pay funeral costs for anyone killed in a drunken driving accident on New Year's Eve a sobering thought For the past 10 years, <PERSON> Neel </PERSON>'s funeral home and cemetery has offered a free casket, funeral service and burial to anyone killed in a drunken-driving accident during the end-of-year celebrations. So far, no one has collected, and <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> thinks his offer has made a difference. `` I ca n't prove it with statistics, of course, but I get so many calls and letters you would n't believe,'' <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> said Friday. `` They tell me it's made them more aware of drinking. I know it has me and my friends. The publicity, I'm sure, has done some good.'' <PERSON> Neel </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Woodlawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, started the practice in 1979, and he believes he was the first to do so. `` I've been challenged on that by other funeral directors,'' he said. `` But I know of no one who offers all of the services that we do _ the family would not have to spend one cent.'' <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> said the casket, grave, funeral service, minister, embalming, flowers and incidentals would cost about $ 3,500. Originally, <LOCATION> Woodlawn </LOCATION> required that those who planned to drink and drive over the holiday had to sign up to take advantage of the offer. Later, <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> dropped that stipulation and just had people call in beforehand. But for the past two years, all that a relative or friend of the deceased had to do was come in after the accident and request the funeral. The victim does not have to be the person driving. He or she can be a passenger or an innocent bystander killed in a smash-up caused by a drunken driver. To dramatize the project this year, <LOCATION> Woodlawn </LOCATION> dug a fresh grave Friday morning, provided a vault and chapel tent and had a minister on hand for television cameras and reporters. `` We pray that it wo n't be used,'' said <PERSON> Neel </PERSON>. `` It's an unusual thing to do and publicize, but if we save even one life, it's worth it.''

<TEXT>
 The government resigned Friday in reaction to mounting criticism of its handling of an economic crisis, the first to do so since the communists took power after World War II. The move, a sign of the liberalization creeping into <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s one-party system, represented a further break with the legacy of President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, founder of communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and its undisputed leader until his death in 1980 Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he and the entire 31-member Cabinet stepped down because legislators refused Wednesday to pass an economic law needed to ensure continued support from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Mikulic, a 60-year-old economist and <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> ally who took office in May 1986, was seen as a hardliner in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His resignation indicated that reform-oriented forces eager to adopt Western-style changes are gaining the upper hand in a protracted political struggle. Few Yugoslavs, however, expected <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s resignation to bring any immediate solutions to an economic crisis that has reduced living standards by 50 percent since 1980. Foreign debt stands at $ 21 billion, unemployment at 15 percent and inflation at around 250 percent _ three times what it was when <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> took office. In a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> broadcast on live national television, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> firmly rejected responsibility for the country's economic and social woes. Effectively blaming the system bequeathed by <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, he said difficulties created in past decades could not be solved in the 2 -LCB- years he has spent in office. Mikulic will stay in office as a caretaker premier until the nine-man federal presidency names a new government in January. The complex federal system bequeathed by <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> stipulates that all federal decisions must be unanimously agreed on by <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces. In practice, this has meant that federal decisions are watered down to ineffectual compromises that each region interprets as it wants. Referring to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s maze of federal, <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> and local bureaucracies and laws, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that decisions about the economy are made in 7,000 to 8,000 different places, suggesting it was unfair to blame the government. Falling living standards have provoked more than 1,000 strikes this year in a country once hailed as a worker-managed state. Discontent also has eaten at the prestige of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose membership has fallen steadily. Two <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> residents who asked not to be named said they expected little to change after the first fall of a Communist government in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` Did they fall indeed?'' a travel agent asked upon being told the news. `` So who is going to congratulate us -LRB- for -RRB- the New Year?'' she quipped. A housewife shopping before the three-day New Year holiday lamented the difficulty of making ends meet each month. `` So what do you expect will happen now?,'' she said. `` They are all of a kind. They can not do anything, or do not want to, except build seaside villas at the expense of the workers.'' She was referring to a scandal in <LOCATION> Mikulic </LOCATION>'s native republic of <LOCATION> Bosnia-Hercegovina </LOCATION>, where hundreds of party officials have been accused of securing illegal loans to build themselves homes in the Adriatic resort of Neum. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> survived an attempted vote of confidence in May, when parliamentary deputies from the liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> failed to gain support from four other republics for <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s ouster. But criticism had mounted in recent weeks. Government minister <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovac </PERSON>, who oversaw <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s negotiations with its debtors, resigned Dec. 5, citing unidentified pressures that hindered market-oriented reform. Ironically, parliament on Thursday passed a package of economic reform laws that should allow mixed ownership and greater foreign investment _ measures economists have long prescribed for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic ills. Increasing poverty has exacerbated traditional ethnic conflicts among the more than 30 ethnic groups who make up <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million citizens. But parliament on Wednesday defied <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s warnings about the need to live up to its obligations to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, refusing to pass a law curbing public spending. Such austerity measures are a condition of <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> aid to inflation-ridden countries such as <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> had demanded the law as a condition for granting the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> government a one-year, $ 416 million standby credit in June. Some $ 260 million of that credit has been used to date, according to official estimates. The loan also encouraged Western creditors to reschedule payments on <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s mounting foreign debt.

 From a beekeeper and a mailman to a Rothschild and three Olympic gold medalists, the humble and the powerful were rewarded Saturday for good works and political loyalty in that grand old British tradition, the queen's New Year honors list. Sculptor <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Paolozzi </PERSON> is knighted, as is <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> secretary who resigned in controversy in 1986. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Holroyd </PERSON>, biographer of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, becomes a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, as do actor <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON>, director of the Academy of Ancient Music. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> bestowed 907 titles and medals _ most of them to people selected by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government for the twice-yearly expression o gratitude. They will be joined in June by hundreds more from the queen's birthday list. Although critics say the ancient honors tradition has been tarnished by political patronage, a barony, a knighthood or a British Empire Medal is still a glittering prize to be treasured for life and remembered with pride by one's descendents. Barons and baronesses are addressed as lords and ladies and can sit in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s unelected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> in the company of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ancient aristocratic families. Knights are addressed as sir, and their female equivalents are dames. An Officer of the Order of the British Empire gets to add OBE after his or her name. There is no cash reward but to many the rise in status is priceless. For the public at large, it is an occasion to reflect on heroes both sung and unsung, like <PERSON> Domingos </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Diago </PERSON> <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> doctor got an OBE for leading the medical team that treated casualties in an Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombing that killed eight soldiers. This power to pander to vanity prompts accusations _ firmly denied _ that prime ministers use the honors to repay political cronies and party fund donors. Political loyalty is warmly rewarded each year. <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>, awarded a knighthood, was a close Cabinet ally of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> before he resigned for approving the leak of a controversial letter during a government crisis. He is now one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two commissioners on the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s administrative body. The government, underlining Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s new commitment to conservation, recommended honors for several guardians of the environment this year. The highest goes to <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chemistry professor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who chaired a commission on environmental pollution. He becomes a life baron. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> N.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> and Sons and member of the British branch of the illustrious banking family, becomes a knight, as does <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, editor of the respected <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Following the peerages and knighthoods, the highest honors belong to the Order of the British Empire and its Commanders -LRB- CBE -RRB-, Officers -LRB- OBE -RRB-, and Members -LRB- MBE -RRB-. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaile </PERSON>, yachting gold medalists at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, receive MBEs, while <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON>, captain of the gold-medal-winning hockey team gets an OBE. An OBE goes to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlewood </PERSON>, 57, who masterminded the four-year reconstruction of the badly burned south transept of York Minster, the medieval cathedral where his family has worked for three generations. <PERSON> Littlewood </PERSON> supervised the craftsmen who worked in stone, wood and stained glass and the queen celebrated the completed work this year, 12 months ahead of schedule. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beekeeping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> becomes one of 306 new MBEs. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quantrill </PERSON>, postman, wins a British Empire Medal. An MBE also goes to darts champ <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most recognizable sportsmen The rotund `` Crafty Cockney,'' reckoned the greatest darts player in history, becomes the first in his field to win such an honor. Actress <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, known to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> TV audiences for her role in `` To The Manor Born'' and `` The Good Neighbors,'' and actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Briers </PERSON>, who also appeared in `` The Good Neighbors,'' receive OBEs, as does horror film actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushing </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, honored with a CBE, portrayed spy <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> in the BBC-TV play `` Anthony Blunt'' in addition to many film and stage roles.

 Some residents of this southwestern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> community where even <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> received a warning are complaining that police were too quick with the ticket pad this holiday season. The ticketing incidents that have provoked complaints _ and even one poem _ included a warning given to a youth dressed as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> that his makeshift sleigh was a traffic hazard. <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabinsky </PERSON>, the maitre d' at the <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, fired off a poem to the police with the $ 10 payment for the parking ticket he received at 4:30 a.m. two days before Christmas for illegally parking on a dead-end street. The poem reads in part: `` I'll remember your deed at the ` Policemen's Ball,' You'll attend this winter in the Country Club hall, For that's where I work, so this should be fun, Your soup will be cold, and your steak overdone.'' <PERSON> Sabinsky </PERSON> said he was surprised when he received his $ 10 check back from the police department. `` I really had not expected it,'' <PERSON> Sabinsky </PERSON> said. `` I just wanted to have a little fun.'' Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said police face a no-win situation since other residents are concerned that traffic enforcement is not strong enough. `` We are paid by the taxpayers to enforce the law,'' <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said. From Nov. 25 to Dec. 24, police issued 1,114 summonses for all traffic offenses, including speeding, drunken driving and moving violations, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said. During the week before Christmas, officers issued 93 written warnings rather than writing tickets bearing fines, he said.

 Soldiers of the pro-Soviet Afghan government will cease firing on U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas next week and will refrain from attacks as long as the insurgents do, <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Friday. But a guerrilla spokesman in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said the insurgents would keep fighting in the 10-year war, rendering the truce meaningless. `` All sections and divisions of the republic's military forces have been given an order to observe a cease-fire from Jan. 1 in conditions in which the opposite side will refrain from direct attack,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as saying on Afghan television. Afghan government radio said Moslem insurgents will be given four days to accept the truce. If they refuse, government troops will start shooting again, said <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The truce was dismissed by <PERSON> Masood </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. Its leader, <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> last month. `` We did not start our fight because he asked us to, and we wo n't stop because he asked us to,'' <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said `` He wo n't have any cease-fire because mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- wo n't stop fighting.'' Soviet troops marched into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the communist government fight the guerrillas. In April, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signed a U.N.-brokered accord providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers by Feb. 15, 1989. Half had left by Aug. 15. Soviet officials say the withdrawal was halted because of continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> aid to the guerrillas. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 7, proposed that a cease-fire begin in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Jan. 1 and that all military supplies be cut off. The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> rejected the cease-fire. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also declared a cease-fire that began Jan. 15, 1988, but the insurgents ignored it and the fighting continued. <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said the fighting wo n't stop until <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> also has met former Afghan King <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to discuss a plan for convening a council of 50 to 60 politicians or prominent public figures to create a new government. <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has escalated the fighting inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within the past two weeks. He said the <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> commander <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> reported civilian casualties were heavy after bombing raids in the northern <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> provincial capital of <LOCATION> Taloqan </LOCATION>. There also were indications the guerrillas planned to step up their offensive. Leaders of the Pakistan-based Afghan guerrilla alliance left <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Friday after apparently working out a joint strategy with Iranian-backed rivals aimed at toppling the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime and installing an Islamic government, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the Pakistan-based guerrillas, led by <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, were seen off at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mehrabad </LOCATION> airport by <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, a leader of the Iran-based coalition. The two guerrilla groups declared Tuesday, the ninth anniversary of the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, that they will not accept any cease-fire until all the Soviets have left and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government has been toppled. The eight-party Iran-based group is Shiite Moslem, like most Iranians; and the Pakistan-based alliance is Sunni Moslem. Shiites make up about 20 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 13 million people. In the past, the radical Shiite factions have largely operated separately from the Pakistan-based groups and taken a more extremist Islamic position about the role of religion in any future Afghan government. The Iranians, who are improving relations with the Soviets after years of strain, have been trying to reconcile the two guerrilla coalitions in the hope of producing an Afghan government dominated by the Moslem insurgents. The Soviet withdrawal has been hampered by unremitting attacks by the estimated 200,000 <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>. The 50,000-60 ,000 Soviet troops still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are believed to be concentrated in two evacuation corridors in the east and west while the guerrillas battle against the increasingly demoralized Afghan army in worsening winter conditions

 Leading supporters of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms said in a letter published Friday that his policies are being bogged down by a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` dictatorship of mediocrity'' that ought to resign. Six artists, directors and editors, in an open letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said elections for a new government structure, a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, will determine real power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They pledged all-out support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But they said that a campaign begun after the June party conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to review nearly 20 million party members with a view toward their support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms had been hampered by too many directives. They said that experience made them doubt whether the elections would firmly implant reformers throughout the Soviet system. `` Can it be said that we are entering the new year and moving toward elections with full confidence in the irreversibility of the democratic renewal of society?'' they asked. `` One would very much like to answer that question positively. But a feeling of sensible, realistic responsibility holds us back from such an evaluation.'' The writers said a `` dictatorship of mediocrity'' was rampant, not only among individual conservatives who remain in the party apparatus, but throughout the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The letter was published in the Jan. 1 edition of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which was released Friday. It was signed by <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON>, editor of the monthly literary journal <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION>; playwright <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>; author <PERSON> Danil </PERSON> <PERSON> Granin </PERSON>; film producer <PERSON> Elem </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimov </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulyanov </PERSON>; and space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>. Speeches by <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ulyanov </PERSON> both caused sharp disputes with conservatives at the June party conference. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has sought to get the party out of day-to-day management, leaving that to local economic and government officials. But the party retains final authority and has shown no sign of tolerating any opposition. The writers said that there undoubtedly must be opponents of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society, and that they must be able to state their ideas. But it said party members who oppose <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms must be judged severely `` Those who do not agree with the new course must retire,'' they said. The six also appealed for more tolerance of informal political and social organizations that have sprung up in the freer atmosphere fostered by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` If we do n't find the path toward cooperation with dissidents, a temptation to rush to repressive measures probably will arise _ and already has arisen _ with all the anti-democratic consequences that flow from this,'' they said. Cooperation with dissidents `` not only does n't weaken, but on the contrary, strengthens the authority of restructuring'' they said.

 Sales of new homes, hurt by a big slump in activity in the Northeast, declined by 8 percent in November, the largest setback in 18 months, the government reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671,000 units last month, down from a revised October sales rate of 729,000 units. The November decline was the second in the past three months and the sharpest since an 11.6 percent decrease in May 1987. Sales had risen 4.4 percent in October. While three of the four regions of the country showed sales declines from October to November, the biggest by far was a 27.3 percent plunge in sales in the Northeast. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said the latest decline reflected a further cooling off of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> market, which had been the hottest sales area for the past several years. `` An awful lot of weakness has developed in the Northeast market, while the West has been surging,'' <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> said. `` For the first 11 months of the year, we have seen about a 15 percent decline in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, compared to the same period a year ago, while sales in the West are up by about 10 percent.'' The regional cross-currents have resulted in total sales nationally holding essentialy unchanged from the 1987 level of 671,000 new homes sold. However, <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> predicted that new home sales would drop by about 6 percent in 1989, reflecting slower economic growth and higher mortgage rates. He predicted that mortgage rates could rise as high as 12 percent by mid-year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that rates rose to 10.77 percent in the week just ending, up from 10.68 percent a week ago, and the highest level since early November 1987. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, senior economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also predicted mortgage rates would continue rising, but he said the fact that existing home sales showed an increase in November should be viewed as a good sign that the bottom is not falling out of the housing market. `` The numbers this month suggest that some buyers are switching from new homes to existing homes, particularly in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, because they believe they represent a better value,'' <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said. The decline in sales was accompanied by a drop in prices. The median price of a new home fell 4.2 percent to $ 110,200 in November. The average price was down as well, declining by 0.8 percent to $ 138,900. In addition to the Northeast, sales were off 7.5 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to a rate of 245,000 units and down 6.8 percent in the West to a rate of 233,000 units. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was the only region of the country to enjoy a rise in sales in November, a 5.2 percent increase to an annual rate of 121,000 units. This region is currently benefiting from a rebounding economy as the area's manufacturing industries enjoy rising demand from a boom in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports.

<HEAD>Politburo Criticizes Food Distribution After Quake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Kremlin commission overseeing earthquake relief efforts sharply criticized food suppliers in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, saying their lack of vigilance has led to rumors of unfair food distribution, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. In another report, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> called for an improved civil defense system to react to disasters like the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people. The official news agency, in a report from the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, said the Politburo commission led by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Balatin </PERSON> warned that officials responsible for poorly organized food supplies to devastated northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> would be held personally responsibile. `` The work style of a number of officials is limited to commands. They do not actually have the situation in hand and do not make spot checks to exercise control at local level,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Lack of control `` has led to contradictory and unfounded rumors about an allegedly unfair distribution of relief aid,'' it said. It did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said 34 food stores reopened in the city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest with a population of 280,000 before the earthquake. Ten fruit and vegetable stores and nine department stores also reopened, it said. On Thursday, Armenian officials said the number of bodies recovered was fewer than 25,000 and that only about 100 remained to be found. They blamed the initial death toll estimate of 55,000 on information based on the amount of physical destruction and the disruption of communications and transportation. Many Armenians are still homeless and ailing, and foreign volunteers will be needed there for up to two years, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> president said `` There is tremendous fear even now about the possibility of aftershocks, so even the little housing that is habitable in the worst-hit areas is being avoided,'' <PERSON> Botho </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> after returning from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Other Red Cross officials said the housing problem is worsening because temperatures are falling and there is not enough tent space. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Politburo commission adopted a plan for improving <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s railroads to ensure that aid gets to the stricken area. Without dramatic improvements in the rail lines that were torn up by the quake, it said, aid wo n't reach affected areas fast enough. Road, air and rail bottlenecks have slowed movement of relief supplies to the area in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the Soviet south. Officials from Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> down have criticized the organization of the early relief work. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> has called for upgrading civil defense services in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, incorporating well-trained military and civilian experts. Specialized foreign rescue teams using trained dogs and sophisticated equipment pulled scores of people from the rubble in the ruined cities. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did not have any comparable teams. More than 23,000 soldiers were sent to the area to restore communications and utilities, preserve order, and provide medical care and food.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on Friday offered to send experts to help identify explosives that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 following reports a Czech-manufactured explosive may have been used. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement categorically denied that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ever provided explosives to terrorists. British authorities said Wednesday that the residue of explosives recovered from the debris of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that crashed in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, was `` consistent with the use of a high-performance plastic explosive.'' That led to speculation the bomb may have been made of Semtex, an orange-colored plastic explosive manufactured in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Terrorism experts and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> obtained Semtex from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and passed it on to surrogate terrorist groups. So far, no group or individual has been identified as a prime suspect in the bombing. `` <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> again emphasizes that it condemns categorically all acts, forms and methods of terrorism and that it complies consistently with the appropriate international commitments,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, carried by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has never supplied and does not supply explosions to terrorist organizations,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the Ministry issued the statement in response to reports Semtex may have been used in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster. `` We are ... prepared, should this help the identification of the explosive used, to send any time Czechoslovak experts for the appropriate expert consultations,'' the statement said.

 Federal police said Friday they are close to solving the slaying of an ecologist who angered ranchers by fighting to protect the vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. `` The murder is still not solved, but the investigation is heading in the right direction and is close to the end,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, 44, was shot to death Dec. 22 outside his home in the jungle town of <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, 2,660 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, near the Bolivian border. <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> said the body was to be exhumed `` so there will be no doubts when we reach our conclusions.'' <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, honored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for his defense of the environment and his belief that the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle could be developed without being destroyed, had said before his death that big landowners had made threats against his life. Federal agents sent to far-off Acre state to work on the <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> case detained five ranchers Thursday for questioning but did not formally arrest them, <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Meat imports are not expected to rise enough in 1989 to trigger mandatory quotas on shipments from foreign suppliers, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Friday. The annual estimate is required by law and is subject to revision every three months during the calendar year. It was the first estimate for 1989. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said a formula in the law calls for maximum imports of slightly less than 1.438 billion pounds in 1989, down 87.7 million pounds from the 1988 trigger level. But <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said total 1989 imports are not expected to exceed 1.425 billion pounds, or about 13 million pounds below the quota trigger. The law covers imports of fresh, chilled or frozen meat of cattle, sheep -LRB- except lambs -RRB- and goats, and certain prepared and preserved beef and veal products. Most is low-grade beef used to make hamburger and other processed meat items. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> are the principal suppliers, although about a dozen countries are eligible to ship quota-type meat into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market.

<HEAD>Alabama County Still Reeling From 1977 Air Force Base Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It has been 11 years since <ORGANIZATION> Craig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> furled its flag in the nation's last round of military-base closings, a blow the mayor says hurt <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> more than the tumultuous civil rights era. In just one day _ Oct. 1, 1977 _ the city and surrounding <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> lost 2,500 military and civilian jobs, a $ 40 million payroll and untold millions in economic spinoffs, the kind of fiscal future other communities may face under the list of 34 recommended base closings released Thursday by a government panel. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> then and now, said Friday that gains have been made in converting the former flight-training base to private use. But the mostly black, rural area still has not recovered, he said. `` We have n't got it developed like we hoped it would be. It's mostly turned into a housing project,'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said While the nation remembers <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> for civil rights benchmarks like the Bloody Sunday clash on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s subsequent voting rights march to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> in 1965, <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said the loss of <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> was `` the biggest single impact ... we've had on the area.'' `` People do adjust to civil rights changes. But it's hard to adjust to an economic loss like the base,'' he said. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, head of the authority that oversees what used to be the base, said <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate temporarily doubled to about 20 percent when <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> shut down. `` But it was a lot more than that. There was the real estate. And people who were used to having a lot of military business lost it,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. State statistics showed <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate at 8.6 percent in 1976, the last full year of record-keeping before the closing. The rate rose to 9.3 percent in 1979, but that number reflects only the number of residents seeking employment. Rather than try to find work in the county, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> estimates that 3,000 to 3,700 people out of a town of 27,000 simply left. In the decade since <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>'s closure, local authorities have fought tooth-and-nail over the field, <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said. `` We got word one time that -LRB- federal officials -RRB- were considering putting Cuban prisoners out here. We stopped that. The state prison people were going to put a minimum-security prison out here, and we stopped that,'' he said. What does exist at <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> is a municipal airport, a training school for state police officers and prison guards, several companies, warehouses and housing. While as many as 700 people worked at <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> two years ago, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the recent closing of a Beechcraft Aircraft plant reduced that number to 275 to 300. Of the 500 military housing units on the property, the federal government controls 50, the <LOCATION> Craig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> sold about 50, about 330 are rented and 70 remain vacant, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> had some advice for communities that stand to lose military facilities under the panel's recommendations: `` They need to go after that property. I think you need to plan your work and then work your plan.''

<HEAD>Criminal Records of 120 Convicted After 1956 Revised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s presidential council Friday revised the criminal record of 120 people convicted after the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. They were among 174 people who were excluded from a broad amnesty in September for those imprisoned for participating in the revolt. The people who were not covered by the amnesty had been told at that time to sumbit a proposal to the presidential council on granting individual pardons until Nov. 30, 1988. <PERSON> Katalin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s amnesty department, said Friday that those not granted clemency involved cases `` when manslaughter was committed ... amid inhuman circumstances in a dastardly manner, like the killing of wounded persons,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. Clemency was also not granted to those convicted of robbery, shop-breaking or when `` vengeance motivated the actual or attempted killing of persons because of their political persuasion or office held,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> as saying. He said those not included in the present clemency act can petition the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> again next year. According to the amnesty ruling, those convicted for their role in the 1956 revolt had their criminal record erased. A criminal record is one reason for denying the issuance of a passport in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, meaning those granted clemency would likely be permitted to travel under <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s liberalized travel laws. The September amnesty covered those sentenced to imprisonment for crimes against the state, `` counterrevolutionary activities,'' or persons whose death penalty was commuted to imprisonment. The amnesty did not extend, however, to those convicted of high treason or espionage, or those who, in `` cumulation of offenses, committed homicide, robbery and caused public danger.'' The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a new government amd demands that Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. On Nov. 4, 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks struck at <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to quell the uprising

<DATELINE>SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly half of more than 200 people studied failed to keep their New Year's resolutions for a month, and less than one in five followed their pledges for two years, a researcher said. `` Sticking to your resolution takes more than willpower, it takes careful planning both before and after the new year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norcross </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scranton </ORGANIZATION>'s psychology department. <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION> headed a research team that showed only 55 percent of 213 people kept their New Year's resolution for a month. Only 19 percent kept their pledge for two years, he said this week. The study ran from Jan. 1, 1986, through Jan. 1, 1988. People who make New Year's resolutions need to take them seriously and follow a systematic strategy for keeping them, or not make them at all, said <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION>, who is also a clinical psychologist. `` More than half a million American adults routinely make New Year's resolutions, and year after year they fail,'' he said. `` Not because they lack desire. Rather, they are poorly prepared to change and are under-educated in the complex process of self-change.'' <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION> suggested several steps before the new year to improve chances of a resolution succeeding, including: _ Define an attainable goal _ Solicit the cooperation of family and friends _ Have a substitute for the behavior to be changed A social worker in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, does n't recommend resolutions at all. `` You're really setting yourself up for a fall with these things,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON>, a social worker at <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's because we usually set things up that are way beyond our reach. I just do n't believe in making them at all.'' The key to keep from giving up and saving yourself from the guilt that usually accompanies failure, <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> said, is setting your sights on one or two small, specific goals and then working on them as soon as possible. <PERSON> Norcross </PERSON> said environmental control, self-reward and willpower were the keys to self-change. `` For example, smokers who want to kick the habit could remove ashtrays from their home and avoid situations that would tempt them to smoke,'' he said. `` They also could devise self-rewards, such as complimenting themselves or treating themselves to a night out for staying off cigarettes.'' <PERSON> Norcross </PERSON> said people also should be persistent, even if they slip along the way. His research showed successful resolvers slipped an average of 14 times during the two years of the study. `` Meaningful behavior change is a lifelong pursuit. It takes the average smoker five to seven tries to quit for good,'' he said.

She made an `` O'' with her thumb and forefinger and explained where the button for the operator was on the telephone dial. `` Tell her your mama's very sick,'' she told <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. Then <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> told the operator that his daddy worked at <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> in the computer room. Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> told <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> the phone number and spelled their last name and he repeated it to the operator, she said. When the operator got <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, 33, on the line, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> said: `` Daddy, mama's very sick. You're going to have to come home.'' <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> called for an ambulance and rushed home. Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Schumpert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where she had emergency surgery. Doctors said she had lost three pints of blood and was near death. Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> had never used the telephone before but handled the situation like a veteran caller. `` He knows his numbers. But he's only in 3-year-old preschool,'' she said. `` He catches on real quick. He's 3 but he acts like he's about 7 `` He never got nervous. I was trying not to get him upset. He took it like a pro,'' his mother said proudly. <PERSON> Bonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> operator who took the call, said she does n't often get emergency calls from children. `` A lot of times when you do, it's children playing a prank which at first I thought he was doing,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Friday. But, she said, it quickly became obvious that the situation was serious. `` You could tell there was definitely something wrong,'' she said. Now, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s enjoying the attention that comes with heroism. `` Yesterday, when the newspaper was up here he was telling them all about it _ shaking their hands and everything,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said. `` He's going to think his picture should be in the paper every day.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> said she hopes to go home Sunday.

 Masked leftist guerrillas broke into candlelight dinners at three stylish <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> restaurants, forced patrons and staff out into the street and then firebombed the establishments, authorities said Friday. The incidents late Thursday night followed a noontime vigil in which top church and political authorities asked Peruvians to pause to pray for a peaceful end to insurgency violence, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives since 1980. No one was hurt in the restaurant raids, police said.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official has accused Turkish police of routinely torturing detainees despite government efforts to polish up <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s human rights image, a Dutch newspaper reported Friday. The <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handelsblad </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooimans </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> special rapporteur on human rights, also charged <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> with frequently denying suspects legal assistance and keeping them in total isolation after their arrest. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which has signed several <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> conventions banning the use of torture, is eager to improve its human rights reputation after filing an application to join the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that its chief economic forecasting gauge edged down 0.2 percent in November, continuing a sawtooth pattern that analysts said portends a slowdown but no recession in 1989. The sluggishness in the department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators was actually viewed as good news by some experts, who said it should ease fears that the economy was growing at a pace threatening new inflation. The 0.2 percent November decline was the fourth drop in the past seven months. Since May, the index has alternated between gains and declines, showing very little forward momentum. The index has risen by just 1.6 percent over the past 12 months, less than half of the 4.1 percent increase of the previous 12-month period, suggesting that overall economic growth will slow significantly in 1989. In another signal of slower growth, the government reported Friday that sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in November, the biggest decline in 18 months. Analysts blamed the setback, which put sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671,000 units, on rising mortgage rates likely to further dampen sales in 1989. The last government numbers of 1988 had little or no influence over the financial markets, which closed out the final trading day of the year with mixed results in light trading. Bond prices rose slightly, the dollar weakened marginally against key currencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 14.11 points to close at 2,168.57, though advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the setback in the leading index was nothing to become alarmed over, showing only that the economy was slowing a bit. The traditional signal for a recession in the past has been at least three consecutive monthly declines in the index. `` The data continue to suggest a trend towards slower but continued economic growth and moderate inflation in the months ahead,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is vacationing. Private analysts agreed, forecasting that overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, will probably dip to around 2.5 percent in 1989. That would be down from an expected growth rate of 3.9 percent in 1988, the economy's best performance in four years. `` We turned in a real strong 1988 despite the drought, but it is virtually certain that we will see slower growth in 1989,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. Economists said that with many factories producing at near peak capacity and the unemployment rate near a 14-year low, a slowdown is needed to dampen inflationary pressures. Most said they saw little danger that the slowdown would threaten a recession next year. `` Because we are still growing at a fairly rapid clip, we can slow quite a bit before there is a danger of a recession,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This slowing will be very good news for the economy because it will remove inflationary pressures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been nudging interest rates up since last March and analysts said they expected further credit tightening moves in the early part of 1989 until the central bank becomes convinced that inflationary forces are under control. In November, four of the available nine indicators contributed to the decline in the leading index, which fell to 193.2 percent of its 1967 base of 100. The biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery times on business orders. This is viewed negatively for the future because it indicates declining demand for products. The other negative factors dragging the index down were a fall in stock prices, an increase in weekly unemployment claims and a decline in raw materials prices, also viewed as a negative because it signals falling demand. Three indicators made positive contributions, led by an increase in growth in the money supply. Other positive forces were a rise in manufacturing orders for consumer goods and an increase in orders for new plants and equipment. Two indicators, building permits and the length of the average workweek, were unchanged in November.

<HEAD>Court Calls For More Study Of Offshore Oil Threat To Wildlife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did not adequately study the protections needed for migratory wildlife before adopting a plan last year for offshore oil and gas leasing through 1992, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` failed to perform an adequate analysis of the cumulative impacts of the program on migratory species.'' It ordered the department to try again, though the ruling does not immediately impede the leasing program. The wildlife at issue include the gray whale and salmon that migrate in the north <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and various migratory birds. The appeals court's unsigned, 64-page opinion rejected all other aspects of a challenge against the five-year plan adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> in July 1987. The previous five-year plan survived all court challenges. The latest plan was challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, other environmental groups and the states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Leasing activities have not been held in abeyance pending the legal fight, however, and are not immediately affected by Friday's ruling The appeals court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to comply with federal environmental law by providing the required environmental impact statements on migratory species. `` This is a significant victory for the environment,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It allows the new secretary of Interior and -LRB- President-elect -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to look at the entire leasing program and decide whether there should be a kinder, gentler five-year plan.'' He said the ruling would carry a profound impact for federal waters off northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> where as yet no oil and gas leasing has occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the largest trade group, said it was pleased with the decision: `` It reaffirms what we have long been saying, that the five-year offshore leasing program does address adequately and fairly the concerns of state and local interests.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bettenberg </PERSON>, associate director of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` pleased and not very surprised'' that the department had been largely upheld `` It will be very easy'' to meet the court's requirement in about two months, he said, since the analysis already has been done for the various leasing areas individually, and what has to be done is show the impact, if any, across all areas. `` Based on all the research done previously, I'm confident we'll find no substantial impact'' on migrations, <PERSON> Bettenberg </PERSON> said The first possible lease offering that could be affected is scheduled in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for December 1989.

<HEAD>Contract That Gave Credit Card Numbers to Inmates Canceled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal contract that gave prisoners processing mortgage applications access to credit card and bank account numbers has been canceled. `` I ca n't run the risk. It's just too high a risk,'' Warden <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> said Thursday. `` No one in their right mind is going to allow this stuff in an institution.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether any inmates might have misused the information. The contract between the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and the prison called for inmates to type information from completed mortgage applications into computers. Since the work began as a pilot project in July, more than 60,000 applications have been sent to the prison. About 600 of the applications contained either credit card or bank account numbers. The decision to discontinue the contract between <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and the prison was made during a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>. An inmate at the institution, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, first sounded the alarm about the credit card numbers, the <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Leader </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, serving a 40-year sentence for bank and credit card fraud, told him that some inmates had copied the credit card numbers and that some of the information had been passed out of the institution. Secret Service agent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cravens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, who is heading the investigation, said Friday there was no evidence the information was being used illegally. `` So far as we know now, none of the card numbers have been compromised,'' he said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> mortgage applications did not ask applicants for their credit card or bank account numbers. `` Some overzealous lending officers added the information to the application in an effort to overdocument the applications,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

 <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, a satirist and poet whose 1966 trial along with <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinyavsky </PERSON> was a worldwide sensation and marked the beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents, died at his home Friday, his former wife said. `` He died today about 10 p.m. He suffered a stroke,'' said <PERSON> Larisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogoraz </PERSON>, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movement who was <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s wife when he was sentenced to five years in prison and labor camp for publishing his works abroad <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> was 63 years old and had been in ill health for years. `` He had suffered several heart attacks in June, then he got better,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bogoraz </PERSON>. `` I saw him the day before yesterday, but I ca n't say how he looked.'' She said he had died at his apartment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s most famous work, `` This is <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Calling,'' satirically called for a `` Public Murder Day,'' in which Soviets over the age of 16 would be allowed to kill someone as long as it was not a policeman or a public transport worker. Under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness, some of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s works written in prison camp were published in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in July as he lay in a hospital. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinyavsky </PERSON>, conscious of the ostracism of Nobel Prize-winning author <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> for publishing his novel `` Doctor Zhivago'' abroad, used the pseudonyms <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Arzhak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> <PERSON> Terts </PERSON>, respectively, to publish their works abroad. Despite persecution of writers such as <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s years were relatively free for writers, and came to be known as `` The Thaw.'' But <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinyavsky </PERSON> were arrested in the autumn of 1965, less than a year after <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was ousted by a group of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders from which <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> eventually would emerge as the most powerful. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> received a five-year term in prison and labor camp for illegally publishing his works abroad, and <PERSON> Sinyavsky </PERSON> was sentenced to seven years. It was the first time that criminal charges were brought against Soviet intellectuals for literary criticism of the Soviet system. Dissidents, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police and foreign correspondents huddled outside the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> courtroom where they were tried, and rushed to get word of the proceedings when the defendants' wives would come out during breaks. News of the trial was broadcast back into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by foreign radio stations. The Kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined crackdown on dissidents and unofficial publications, but during the late 1960s unofficial publications and the number of dissidents nevertheless grew. The trial brought Mrs. <PERSON> Bogoraz </PERSON> to prominence.

<HEAD>Pinochet, In Year-end Message, Announces Salary Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a year-end message to the nation Friday, President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> announced a 10 percent increase in the minimum legal salary of $ 57 a month earned by nearly one third of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 4 million workers. The 73-year-old president and army commander said in a speech over national radio and TV that a 10 percent wage increase also will be granted to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 500,000 government workers, with both increases effective Feb. 1. He said the wage increases were made possible by the `` economic equilibrium and the firm economic growth'' achieved by his 15-year-old military government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> asked Chileans to unite to face `` the important challenges that we will meet in the new year.'' He said `` national unity'' is his government's main goal. `` Let's set aside those things that separate us,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said. `` Let's firmly fight those who want to destroy our national soul, and let's form a united front with the single aim of serving <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and Chileans, and make of our motherland a great country.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who came to power following a 1973 coup, was defeated in an Oct. 5 referendum in which he sought to remain in power until 1997. As a result, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was forced to call open presidential and congressional elections, now scheduled for Dec. 14, 1989. He expressed hope that the election will `` consolidate the type of society'' sought by his government.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Block Likely Saturday Closing Of Miami News</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that closing The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> could trigger an antitrust suit if investigators determine that its owner did not make a serious effort to sell the newspaper. The 92-year-old News is due to close Saturday if a buyer is not found. Meanwhile, a federal judge on Friday dismissed efforts by local groups trying to force the News to stay open, saying the government could not compel a newspaper to publish. The News is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and since 1966 has been published under a joint operating agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the rival <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> had been conducting sale negotiations with a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> consultant representing a group of investors, but <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON>, who heads Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>'s newspaper division, said Friday no deal was made. `` It's over,'' <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON> said. In the newsroom, News staffers were cleaning out desks while keeping ears open for the latest efforts to halt the closing. `` It's been real stressful,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> foreign correspondent who became a News columnist 15 months ago. `` This is a very dignified 92-year-old woman and she deserves to die with some honor, not to keep her on life-support systems.'' Many staffers planned to gather in the early morning hours Saturday for the final press run. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found that an amendment to the joint operating agreement allowing <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> to share <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> profits even if the News is shut down means the deal `` would likely lose its antitrust immunity,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, head of the antitrust division. `` That amendment would make it financially beneficial to both parties if the News goes out of business,'' Rule wrote. `` Therefore the investigation deals not only with how vigorous a search was made for potential buyers by <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, but how seriously negotiations were conducted once a potential buyer was found. `` A conclusion that serious efforts by <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> would have resulted in the sale of The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> could provide the basis for an antitrust suit,'' his memo said. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were studying Rule's memo. `` We and our lawyers are reviewing it and we have no comment at the moment,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>. Easterly refused to comment on Rule's statement, saying only, `` Press releases are not law.'' Easterly was attending a hearing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on the federal suit filed by officials from a dozen community newspapers who claim closing the News will result in a monopoly for the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. The plaintiffs included readers and distributors of the News. After the two-hour hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> rejected their arguments. `` The question is whether the government has the power to compel a newspaper to publish if it wishes to be silent,'' <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> said, ruling that he had no such right. He also questioned whether the plaintiffs could show they stood to lose because of the sale. Negotiations for the paper's sale snagged earlier in the week when <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON> rejected the investors' proposal that <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> support the paper's losses for six weeks while the potential buyers obtained a loan.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> review of 17 accidental deaths in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training over the past two years said the service was trying to improve its safety record, but a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> congressman called the report an `` insult'' and accused the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of stonewalling. `` If this was n't so serious, it would be a joke,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> took interest in the issue after the death of a constituent, Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> swimming instructor at the training base in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was convicted of negligent homicide last September in the <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> case and sentenced to 90 days in `` In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, if you hit a parked car you get more of a penalty than that,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. `` This death could have been prevented. It was negiligence. Things got out of hand.'' The paragraph dealing with <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> in the 10-page <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report said the only action taken had been review of training courses `` to ensure maximum safety of students while retaining required realism.'' The court record showed <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had been dunked repeatedly while other recruits were forced to stand with their hands against the wall singing the national anthem. In a letter attached to the report, Assistant Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said `` the personnel casualties we have suffered in training are few when compared to the number of students undergoing training.'' `` That is not to diminish the personal tragedy which is represented by each training fatality,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, chief of personnel for the Pentagon. `` Beyond the personal loss, accidents pose the greatest peacetime threat to our warfighting assets. I assure you that we will continue to pursue vigorously methods to reduce accident losses to our personnel and equipment in our training activities,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s letter said. The Pentagon spending bill for the current fiscal year called on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to report on the training deaths to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Dec. 31. `` We had been going around and around with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and never got answers,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` I thought there had been some stonewalling.'' The congressman said that after he met with <PERSON> Green </PERSON> on Friday morning and complained about the report, `` <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said, ` We will consider this an interim report and we will try to comply''' with a more complete version later. Green could not be reached at his office Friday afternoon. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundin </PERSON>, said he was not familiar with the report, but read a statement: `` A letter forwarding an interim report on the causes and circumstances of all deaths of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel during <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training since Jan. 1, 1986, and on actions taken was sent today to the Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Hon. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, -LRB- D-Texas -RRB-, and the President Pro Tempore of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>,'' D-Miss. Lt. Cmdr. C.W. <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he had not seen the report and could not comment. Spokesmen for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> said the report had not yet reached their offices. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said he would raise his complaints shortly after the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes next Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is due to report on the issue by Feb. 15, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report listed the deceased trainees and the dates and causes of death as: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, Aug. 19, 1988, drowning; <PERSON> Tasene </PERSON> <PERSON> Epenesa </PERSON>, May 17, 1988, cardiac arrest; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON>, March 14, 1988, hypothermia; <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundinger </PERSON>, Dec. 15, 1987, cardiac arrest; <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McSherry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> McMichael </PERSON>, April 15, 1987, air crash; <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON>, Jan. 31, 1987, overexertion while suffering from sickle cell trait; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, Oct. 22, 1986, air crash; <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paredes </PERSON>, Sept. 3, 1986, cardiac arrest; <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, June 8, 1986, parachute jump; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahlinger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, April, 18, 1986, air crash; <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohorques </PERSON>, March 16, 1986, air crash; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>.

 Anti-government protesters took to the streets of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and other cities in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> for a fourth day Friday despite government concessions on food price increases. At least two people were reported killed. A Western diplomat reported rumors of an imminent coup attempt in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and said the East African country remained paralyzed by a general strike. Communications were still disrupted. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Fatih </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdoun </PERSON>, the capital's head of government, told <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> that `` an unidentified gunman opened fire on demonstrators'' outside Cabinet offices on Thursday, killing two and wounding 28. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, speaking by radio from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, also reported one dead and 21 injured, including some victims from outside <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. It was not known whether the victims were included in the previous report. Dispatches received in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> from the Egyptian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> news agencies on Thursday reported what appeared to be two separate shooting incidents, including one after dark with `` intensive shooting'' near government headquarters. There were no reports of new violence Friday. But a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in the Ethiopian capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, reported `` complete political chaos'' in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The diplomat, who watches Sudanese affairs and said he was in contact with <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, said the disturbances `` do not seem to have subsided, despite the fact that the price increases which originally sparked the trouble have been rolled back.'' `` The action in the streets is taking on a definite anti-government flavor,'' he said. `` It looks like the government is in serious trouble. There's a lot of talk about a coup attempt coming out of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>.'' Thousands of Sudanese began demonstrations and strikes Tuesday, a day after the government increased prices of prime commodities by up to 600 percent and imposed a 15 percent sales tax on all goods. On Thursday, in response to a call by the 2-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a general strike closed most businesses and shut down communications and transportation facilities. The government rescinded the price increases on Thursday, but it was not known whether the tax also was eliminated. Officials in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> reported the first apparent loosening of the general strike's grip on the country. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> International Airport sent a notice to area airports that it was back in business for the first time since late Wednesday. But the national airline <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' scheduled service to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> was canceled Friday night because airline employees remained on strike. The diplomat in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> still suffers from a `` complete paralyzation of transport, communications and everyday life. ... The railway is down. Inter - and inner-city buses have stopped rolling Shops are closed.'' It appeared that since the government backed down on the price increases, anger has turned to Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s refusal to submit to the government and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a tentative agreement to end the country's 5 -LCB- - year-old civil war The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, junior partner in the governing coalition, negotiated the pact with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, a renegade army colonel who heads the rebels in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The agreement called for a cease-fire and suspension of Islamic law in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> until the matter can be discussed in a constitutional conference, a major concession for <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>. He had vowed that his mainly Christian and animist forces would continue to fight until the Islam-based legal code was abrogated. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> reportedly was concerned that endorsing the Islamic law clause would prompt the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to leave the government, removing a buffer that the prime minister has used in disputes with the Democratic Unionists. Since the street protests began, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionists </ORGANIZATION>, who dominate the trade union federation, have quit the government in sympathy. Reports on Friday said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> has accepted the six <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> ministers' resignations and will name <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, his brother-in-law and attorney-general, to the key Unionist-held post of foreign minister. That would make <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON> the government's peace negotiator with <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>. As attorney-general <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON> drafted the Islamic legal code, and as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> he has spearheaded opposition to the Unionist-negotiated agreement, so prospects for successfully concluded talks would be virtually nil.

<TEXT>
 Two opposition activists on Friday hung a protest banner reading `` Free the Politicals'' from a balcony at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the capital. The banner was signed with the initials of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> regional council of the Solidarity trade union movement. The protest was connected with a weeklong hunger protest taking place in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> through Sunday to draw attention to the detention of anti-military activists in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Brief displays of opposition banners from public buildings are fairly common in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. However, this appeared to be the first time activists managed to place one on the guarded headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Security workers seized the 15-foot-long banner after about five minutes. The activists, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikonowicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizikowski </PERSON>, were led away into the building and detained, according to <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Authorities meanwhile freed a secret policeman Friday who was sentenced to prison for helping underground members of Solidarity, prison officials and opposition sources said. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodysz </PERSON>, 48, was arrested in 1984 and initially charged with cooperating with Solidarity's underground. Authorities later sentenced him to six years in prison on a more serious charge of corruption, alleging he had taken money to pass police secrets to Solidarity. Solidarity activists have denied any financial motive for <PERSON> Hodysz </PERSON>'s cooperation. They say he was motivated by sympathy for the union movement, which authorities crushed in late 1981 and banned in 1982. <PERSON> Hodysz </PERSON>, a former captain in the state <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, was released from a prison in <LOCATION> Koszalin </LOCATION>, in northwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, according to a duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiaries </ORGANIZATION>. The official refused to give his name. The former policeman was eligible for the parole, subject to good behavior, because he had served two-thirds of his prison sentence. After his release, <PERSON> Hodysz </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s Church in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, a northern port, to meet with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, according to a <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> aide. <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> is a <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> adviser. At the time of <PERSON> Hodysz </PERSON>'s arrest, authorities were trying to stamp out any vestige of Solidarity, the first independent labor movement in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. However, they have increasingly tolerated the movement in recent years and even allowed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to speak in an uncensored television debate in November.

 Roman Catholic leaders announced the selection of conservative <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Eder </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>'s new archbishop Friday but complained of bias in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s list of candidates for the post. In an official statement carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Kathpress </ORGANIZATION>, the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Salzburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapter </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Eder </PERSON> accepted the body's appointment Thursday. It must now be formally made by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The announcement comes at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is suffering from widening divisions over the appointment of conservative bishops and with contentious issues, including the pope's stand on birth control and women's role in the Church. <PERSON> Eder </PERSON> is known as a conservative priest who says Mass in Latin with his back to the congregation. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s called for use of a new Mass in the vernacular with the priest facing the faithful. The <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> chapter said it broke the traditional secrecy surrounding such appointments because of advance media criticism of the choice of yet another conservative for a top church post. <PERSON> Eder </PERSON> was considered by commentators as the least conservative of three candidates put forward for selection by local church leaders. An estimated 260,000 believers have left the church in the past eight years. According to a critical Catholic journal, 30,917 left the church in 1987 alone. The local church leaders also criticized the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s three candidates, saying the list was biased. `` The Cathedral Chapter had to recognize that the selection of candidates for this triple proposal was not taken in such a balanced fashion as could be expected,'' they said in a joint statement. The statement said they had `` exhausted every available possibility'' to make the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> aware of `` the needs of the diocese and the views of the area.'' They said they had sent a letter on the issue to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The appointments of conservative <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON> as archbishop of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in September 1986 and of ultra-conservative <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenn </PERSON> as assistant bishop of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> five months later triggered open protest and division in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> ranks. In the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Friday, the pope nominated five new auxiliary bishops in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and another in the tiny central African country of <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. The pope nominated the Revs. <PERSON> Vilmos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekany </PERSON> and <PERSON> Asztrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Varszeghi </PERSON> to posts in <LOCATION> Esztergom </LOCATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Acs </PERSON> in <PERSON> Eger </PERSON>; the Rev. <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> in Pecs; the Rev. <PERSON> Nandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Takacs </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Szekesfehervar </LOCATION>; and the Rev. <PERSON> Felicien </PERSON> <PERSON> Muvara </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Butare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>.

 Dynamite exploded early Friday at a nightclub popular with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors, but the building was empty at the time and no one was hurt, police reported.

Authorities said, however, that the explosion did not appear aimed at the Americans.

The dynamite, placed at the entrance to the club, shattered windows and bottles of liquor and damaged the furniture. <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION> had planned a non-binding referendum for April on whether residents of the island were in favor of foreign military bases not approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> which service nuclear-powered vessels or those carrying nuclear arms.

 A federal judge refused Friday to block police from arresting homeless people in pre-Orange Bowl weekend roundups, denying an injunction sought by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police of harassing the homeless in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parade </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday in an effort to make the city look clean for tourists and national television audiences. `` When someone is sleeping on a piece of cardboard, they can be arrested for littering,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, seeking a ban on enforcing misdemeanor laws she said were used selectively to round up the poor and homeless. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> ruled on technical grounds, said Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Firtel </PERSON>, who added the decision probably did not allow time for an appeal before the weekend. `` The police are not restrained from enforcing the law, which is all that the city asked,'' said <PERSON> Firtel </PERSON>, who argued against the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in court. `` The police are going to do their duty and follow the law. If they have probable cause to arrest someone, they will go ahead and do that.'' Brother <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, director of the private <ORGANIZATION> Camillus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> homeless shelter, says at any given time there are 10,000 homeless people in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The city offers no public shelters. `` We're going to have observers out in the streets tonight to make sure nothing happens _ and if these sweeps continue we're going to observe them,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lost the fight for a preliminary injunction, but he will continue to press the underlying class-action lawsuit on behalf of the homeless. `` We're still convinced that the misconduct occurred and the homeless are being discriminated against,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> suffer from headaches you do n't get from guerrilla infiltrators, hostile Arab neighbors, or even a Palestinian uprising. No, they have some real headaches: the kind that make your temples throb, turn your brain to porridge, and transform a political speech into medieval torture. Lawmakers blame the endemic headaches on their 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, whose poor ventilation and air conditioning have earned it the nickname `` The Submarine.'' Doctors, in turn, dubbed the lawmakers' physical complaints `` The Submarine Syndrome.'' Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> said Friday the problem has `` a great influence'' on legislators' ability to function. `` This is not a joke; it is a serious problem. I know a lot of legislators who suffer from headaches and dizziness,'' <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. Asked if this was why many of the 120 legislators often look sleepy, <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> said: `` It's really hard to sit here for the whole day. If you spend a whole day here, you leave with a headache.'' The five-story Parliament building on a hilltop in central <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was inaugurated in 1966. The two lower floors, including parts of the main auditorium, are partly underground. The Submarine Syndrome can do more than give you a pounding headache, said <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. `` When I was a new Knesset -LRB- parliament -RRB- member, I met a man who told me that he was a <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> worker, had a good job, and was happy with it. But he resigned because of poor ventilation. He said a doctor told him: ` You have a choice between shortening your life or resigning,''' he said. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a freshman legislator from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he has begun to suffer frequent headaches since the 12th <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> opened Nov. 21. `` Normally, I do n't have headaches, and I think there's some problem with the building,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Throughout the building, it's either too hot or too cold, said maintenance manager <PERSON> Shmaryahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhaus </PERSON>. `` If we heat the first floor where people complain of cold, the heat spreads to the second and third floors, and people there ... feel suffocated by the heat. If we turn down the heat, people on the first floor complain of cold,'' he said. Experts say the solution is to break down the air-conditioning system into smaller systems with individual controls in different parts of the building. But <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said that answer is too expensive. Parliament doctors advise legislators to walk outside from time to time for a breath of fresh air, the radio said. But legislators can not always heed that advice during long debates that often deteriorate into shouting matches _ especially unbearable to people suffering from headaches.

<HEAD>Military Court Orders 20 Held in Fishermen's Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military court on Friday ordered the arrest of 20 members of a military-police task force implicated in the massacre of 14 Venezuelan fishermen in October. `` There was no armed confrontation, but the loss of 14 innocent lives,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambrano </PERSON>, who overruled a lower military court decision in November that the task force acted in `` legitimate self-defense.'' <PERSON> Zambrano </PERSON> presided over a War Council, the highest regional military court, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, about 400 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. He ordered the arrest of the 20 Venezuelans _ 16 members of special police forces and four members of the armed forces _ and a Colombian man believed to be an informant for the brigade. Military spokesmen originally said the 14 men killed were Colombian guerrillas shot in an Oct. 29 firefight with government forces out to prevent them from blowing up oil installations along the Colombian-Venezuelan border. But two survivors who jumped into a river and swam for their lives denied those shot were guerrillas and said they were all fishermen out on a picnic. A major factor in the military's reversal was evidence released publicly, although never made official, that an exhumation of the 14 bodies showed most of the men were shot either in the back or in the head at close range. The case attracted international attention. Government officials received letters from human rights and church groups around the world demanding justice. Townspeople of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amparo </LOCATION>, near the site of the massacre, backed up the two survivors' claims in interviews with journalists. The two survivors, <PERSON> Wolmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, later sought asylum in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> rather than face the military court for trial on charges of `` military rebellion'' based on the official version of events.

 Troops raided a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hideout and killed two Palestinians who tried to flee, and a third <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was killed Friday when soldiers fired at stone-throwing worshipers after Moslem prayers, the army said. At least 10 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman confirmed four wounded. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plans to launch a peace initiative within two months and will seek <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s help in finding Palestinian negotiators who are not tied to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>. The worst clashes erupted in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when dozens of people took to the streets after prayers at the local mosque, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. `` After prayers, they raised the Palestinian flag and threw stones,'' said an army spokesman. Arab reporters said soldiers used clubs, rubber bullets and live ammunition to break up the protest. The army said troops killed one protester and wounded four. The dead man, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalim </PERSON> <PERSON> Behid </PERSON>, 22, was shot during the disturbance and died at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. They put the number of wounded at six, and said a 4-year-old boy was hit in the head with a rubber bullet. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, three Palestinians were wounded, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. In the nearby <LOCATION> Jabalya </LOCATION> refugee camp, a teen-ager was wounded. Late Thursday, troops tried to arrest three suspected firebomb throwers who reportedly were hiding in a home in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Zeitoun </LOCATION> neighborhood, the army said. `` Soldiers shouted for them to come out,'' the army spokesman said. `` They tried to escape and were shot.'' One man died at the scene, and the second at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hospital. A third Palestinian was captured unharmed. The deaths late Thursday and Friday brought to 342 the number of Palestinians killed in their yearlong rebellion against the Israeli occupation. Fourteen Israelis also have died. The army, meanwhile, brought reinforcements to the occupied lands in anticipation of increased violence on Jan. 1, known to Palestinians as `` Fatah Day,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. On that day in 1965, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> launched its first attack against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Along with increased troops, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military government ordered a week-long closure of all Palestinian schools, beginning Saturday. The measure affects 300,000 students. Israeli officials consider Palestinian schools flashpoints of violence, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools were closed by the military government for most of the period from February to December. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, was quoted as saying Friday that his peace initiative would be based on the 1978 Camp David accords, which call for talks on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied lands preceding a final settlement of the conflict. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he would not insist that the U.S.-brokered agreement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> be followed to the letter. `` It is also possible to speak to others,'' he was quoted as saying, referring to Palestinian representation in peace talks. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> envisioned `` a major role'' for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in helping find Palestinians acceptable to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, said earlier this month that he recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terror, and in return the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reversed a longstanding policy and opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reiterated his opposition to an international peace conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, as demanded by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and most Arab nations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he would accept direct talks under the sponsorship of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but said they should be restricted to a ceremonial role `` to give international legitimacy to direct talks.'' Asked how he would respond if President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited him to an international conference with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` I would notify him that I could not come.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s acting prime minister meanwhile instructed his country's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to protest an Israeli air raid on south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Thursday that wounded eight Shiite Moslem militiamen. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, told <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON> to `` lodge an urgent, strongly worded complaint about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s latest aggression.'' The raid by two helicopter gunships nine miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 25th in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and its unions agreed Friday to continue talks beyond the expiration of contracts at midnight Saturday, averting a holiday weekend strike at the Press and the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Post-Gazette. The unions charged Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes both newspapers under a joint operating agreement, would use a strike as an excuse to close the Post-Gazette and give the morning newspaper market to the larger Press. <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accepted a late offer by 10 unions representing about 1,400 non-editorial workers to continue operations under current contract language on 48 hours' notice of a strike `` so long as good-faith negotiations continue.'' The company earlier this week had offered a 30-day extension of current contracts. Company spokesman <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Notter </PERSON> said no negotiations would be held until next week. <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> publishes the afternoon Press and morning Post-Gazette under a 1961 joint operating agreement allowing independent editorial staffs but shared advertising, printing and circulation departments. The union's offer came after both newspapers vowed Friday to continue to publish daily if their joint operating company was struck at midnight Saturday. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pass </PERSON>, attorney for Teamsters Local 211, the largest of the 10 unions, charged it was `` obvious and self-evident that the plan of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> is to force a strike.'' Pass said the Press, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, would `` buy out'' <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> for the remaining years of the joint operating agreement, which continues until Dec. 31, 1999. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>'s `` existence is assured'' through the joint operating agreement and the newspaper `` is not an issue in these negotiations.'' Pass said the two sides differ on company proposals to `` change -LRB- working -RRB- conditions and practices that have gone on for 50 years.'' He said the proposals involved work rules and job security issues. The Teamsters local represents 442 drivers and mechanics and 238 circulation employees. The company's other unionized employees include more than 400 composing room, financial and advertising workers represented by <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Typographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 7, 180 members of <ORGANIZATION> Mailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 22, and 155 members of <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pressmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 9. Other union employees who are negotiating include photo engravers, electricians, machinists, paperhandlers, janitors and engineers. The Press has an average paid circulation of 229,539 daily and 554,685 on Sunday, and the Post-Gazette has an average paid circulation of 168,123 daily, except Sunday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> editors and reporters, who are members of <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 61 </ORGANIZATION>, are working under a three-year contract that expires Dec. 31, 1990. Press editors and reporters are not unionized.

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An influential West German admiral wrote in a magazine article that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should stop acting as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s `` model boy,'' support abolishment of short-range nuclear arms, and seek peace with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In an article written for this week's edition of Stern weekly magazine, Adm. <PERSON> Elmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmaeling </PERSON> promoted policies he said would lead to withdrawal of foreign troops from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other European countries. About 400,000 foreign troops, including 250,000 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are stationed on West German territory. A spate of crashes of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warplanes this year has heightened public controversy over the troops. Schmaeling serves as chief of the West German armed forces' Office for Studies and Exercises, a think tank He has made comments in the past similar to those in the Stern article. He wrote in Stern that it was time to `` re-examine the foundations of our postwar policies'' because of changes in the Soviet bloc. He argued that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes eventual conflict with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is inevitable. In contrast, he wrote, West Germans want `` to overcome confrontation with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' `` The goal is an international system of common security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Schmaeling </PERSON> said that `` for too long we have been playing the role of model boy'' to appear `` reliable, friendly and grateful friends of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owns the short-range, or tactical, nuclear weapons stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps such weapons in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` Nuclear weapons should be allowed to be stationed only on the territory of the country that also has them at their disposal,'' Schmaeling wrote. He called for pursuit of disarmament policies that would lead to ending `` the unnatural situation of foreign troops on one's own territory.'' `` A speeded-up process of mutual disarmament and the dismantling also of conventional invasion weapons must lead to military structures that are purely defensive in all countries.'' `` When this is mutually done ... military alliances with integrated forces can be dissolved,'' he wrote. Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> and other West German officials say foreign troops and short-range nuclear weapons are needed here to offset what they view as a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat.

 A trucker rammed his tractor-trailer into more than 20 cars, seriously injuring at least two people, during an 80-mile chase Friday that snarled <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> morning rush-hour traffic, authorities said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>, 41, of <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, was charged with possession of cocaine and was held in the <LOCATION> Medina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> here under $ 50,000 bond while authorities in other counties prepared other charges against him, officials said. The chase began shortly after 8 a.m. on Interstate 10 near Comfort, about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, said state trooper <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON>. The rig, carrying vegetables from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, sideswiped a vehicle driven by lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Etlinger </PERSON>, who was run off the road but then pursued the fleeing truck, <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON> said. The trucker `` was running between 85 and 90 and he -LRB- Etlinger -RRB- could n't catch him,'' <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON> said. `` He took the whole back end of my station wagon,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kite </PERSON>, who was driving to work in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> when he saw the truck come up behind him. `` All of sudden, there was a KA-WHAM, and I almost started going back under his trailer,'' he said. Troopers, police and at least 10 other drivers also pursued the tractor-trailer before it finally stopped at an Interstate 35 rest area near <LOCATION> Natalia </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. The driver got out of the cab and citizens surrounded him until the pursuing officers arrived to make the arrest, said trooper <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Milikien </PERSON>. `` I was doing about 85 after him and I was about five car lengths behind him,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>, one of the citizens who followed the trucker and kept him from leaving the rest stop. `` They just made sure he did n't run away,'' <PERSON> Milikien </PERSON> said of the citizens, acknowledging that many sped to chase <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>. `` He did n't say anything,'' said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thormann </PERSON>, the first officer to arrive. `` To me he did n't appear that he knew that anything had happened. He was very calm, very cooperative.'' Troopers said they found 4 to 5 grams of cocaine in the cab, and that narcotics officers planned to search the cargo. <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> was charged with possession of a controlled substance, a felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Loera </PERSON>, 62, injured when vehicles were struck, were in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman Lt.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday approved a sweeping agreement that virtually erases trade barriers between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Free Trade Agreement goes into effect on New Year's Day. Furious debate over the pact forced Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to call new elections on Nov. 21. But the contest gave <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> its second straight majority government and a clear mandate to push for passage of the legislation The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> was by voice and not tabulated. Senators from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which fought the agreement fiercely during the fall campaign but promised to let it pass if <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> won, abstained. Later Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamer </PERSON>, acting for Governor General <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauve </PERSON>, gave the bill its final approval. Such approval by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is a vestige of colonial times. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> issued a New Year's statement Friday celebrating Canadians' `` historic opportunity to affirm their confidence in our country's future.'' He used similar language in his pitch for the free-trade agreement in the campaign for November elections. The pact was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> during a volatile session on Dec. 24. The Conservatives used their majority to muscle the bill through 141-111 while irate opposition lawmakers sang the national anthem in protest. The Liberals control the non-elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and had tied up the legislation there last fall, forcing <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to call the election. They promised, however, not to repeat their action if he won a majority government. Even so, they pledged to monitor the trade agreement closely as its effects begin to be felt in coming years. `` Even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become law, our concerns have not disappeared,'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacEachen </PERSON>, the Liberals' leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said during the debate. `` The government has chosen the hard discipline of the market. We will have to monitor whether the market does its job.'' The Liberals hold 59 of the 98 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, allowing them to set up a monitoring committee as trade negotiations under the agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> get under way. The pact was signed Jan. 2, 1988, by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, sparking a year of soul-searching by Canadians. Many believed the trade pact represented a final subjugation of the Canadian identity by its rich southern neighbor. But supporters, especially big business, heralded the agreement as a potential economic boon that would open up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets and eliminate $ 2 billion annually in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs. The two nations, with $ 150 billion in annual trade, already form the world's biggest two-nation trading partnership. But the trade agreement now phases out all remaining tariffs, quotas and duties between them. It also dismantles many investment barriers, frees up trade in energy and services and creates U.S.-Canadian panels to settle disputes. The actual start of the agreement will be low key, with an exchange of diplomatic notes. Special interests on both sides of the border, mainly union and farm groups, criicized various elements of the legislation because it would eliminate protectionist rules for specific industries. <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> grape growers, for example, were upset because the pact would eliminate an automatic 65 percent markup on U.S.-made wine.

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Reactor Restarted After 33 Months Idle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pilgrim nuclear reactor began low-power testing Friday after receiving final federal clearance nearly three years after being shut down and labeled one of the country's worst-run power plants. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the owner, said the restart began about 6 p.m. with the withdrawal of control rods in the reactor. Opposition to Pilgrim's restart has been intense, with state officials pledging to do everything they can to keep the plant from operating and protesters planning to demonstrate at the plant gates Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way Friday for low-power testing of the 670-megawatt reactor for up to 5 percent of its capacity. The restart began a test program intended to take the plant gradually to full power in about four months, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for nuclear power. <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said the utility would continue to work with state and local officials to complete and improve an emergency evacuation plan for towns around the plant. State officials have called the plan inadequate despite revisions, and they also say the plant should not reopen until a study of leukemia rates in the population surrounding the plant is complete. `` We will do whatever we possibly can legally, through the attorney general, to ensure that the plant does n't operate,'' said <PERSON> Martie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We still believe the plant is not ready for restart.'' At the time Pilgrim was shut in April 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> called the plant `` one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the country. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> has spent about $ 200 million since the shutdown to replace nearly all of the plant's top management, work on mechanical problems and fight skepticism by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and a growing anti-nuclear movement among nearby residents. If the plant's restart schedule is followed, consumers can receive power from Pilgrim when it hits 10 percent operating capacity sometime next month. By the end of January, the plant should be at about 25 percent of power, producing 100 megawatts daily, or enough electricity to power 160,000 homes, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Citizens for Safe Energy, an anti-nuclear group, Friday called the reopening `` a slap in the face to local and state government officials and a direct threat to thousands of people living near the Pilgrim nuclear plant.'' `` There are increasing signs that Pilgrim has caused leukemia in nearby residents,'' the group said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> officials said there is no evidence that radiation from the plant has caused any cancer deaths. Citizens for Safe Energy also said the plant should not be brought to full power because `` Pilgrim's history of management and safety failures has continued despite <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> claims to the contrary.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>: `` We're confident that we're proceeding in a very safe and responsible manner and we would n't procede if we did n't think it was safe It's important to realize how many of us live right here with our families.'' In October 1987, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, citing evacuation and safety concerns, asked the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to revoke Pilgrim's operating license. That request was formally denied Thursday in a letter from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murley </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. In a letter dated Friday, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Regional Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> gave permission for the plant to operate, saying the technical issues raised in the shutdown had been resolved. The Pilgrim plant must undergo another review by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> before it is granted permission to operate at full power, a process that could take months.

 A fiery chain-reaction crash that killed four people and injured 10 others took place at the same intersection where two fatal accidents occurred five years ago. A truck driven by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Warrenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, plowed into a line of cars Thursday night at a stoplight at the intersection of the Edens Expressway, also called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 41, and <LOCATION> Clavey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, causing the crash and a series of explosions, authorities said. `` Apparently ... the -LRB- truck -RRB- driver had been driving too many hours and fell asleep,'' said Master Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guess when you're on an interstate like that, you do n't expect to come to a stoplight.'' Just after the light turned green, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s truck smashed into a car, killing the two men and two women inside, <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> said. The car hit by the truck then smashed into others, a chain reaction that involved seven cars in two lanes, he said. The identities of the four dead were not released Friday afternoon. Hall was in good condition at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, suffering from abdominal pain, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>. Block said another crash victim, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, 44, of Zion, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was in fair condition with a rib fracture. Eight other people were treated at the hospital and released, <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. No charges had been filed in the case, <PERSON> Bresnahan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> figures show that at least 509 accidents have occurred at the intersection since 1976. In 1983, two fatal accidents that left four people dead spurred lawmakers to press for the construction of an overpass. `` I think it can be characterized as the most dangerous intersection in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, mayor of this suburban town. The mayor added, `` I do n't know how many deaths we have to have there before the state thinks it's a dangerous intersection.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, an operations engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said the 45 accidents at the intersection in 1987 ranked it sixth in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and 25th in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> metropolitan area. `` In terms of the number of accidents -LRB- the intersection -RRB- does n't rank high It's just the type of accident,'' he said. He said the department had been planning the $ 8.5 million overpass since 1983, and that construction should begin next fall and be completed in late 1990. But the lengthy process was costly, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` Finally it's going through, but not in time to save the lives of those people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departed Friday for a long holiday weekend at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, after receiving a court subpoena that could force him to disclose information on the Iran-Contra affair that he previously has refused to divulge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was subpoenaed along with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a defense witness in the upcoming Iran-Contra conspiracy trial of former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The trial is to begin Jan. 31, which is 11 days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> becomes president. He has repeatedly refused to say what he discussed with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regarding matters involved in the Iran-Contra affair, other than that he had reservations about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legal counsel <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> informed the president-elect Friday morning that the subpoena would be forthcoming, said press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. She added it was `` not unanticipated.'' She had no reaction from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but said he planned no meetings on the subject while on a three-day vacation at the presidential retreat in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> countryside with his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he also left unfilled the two Cabinet-level posts he has not yet named _ energy secretary and drug czar. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> declined to indicate directly whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would fight the subpoena, but noted constitutional and legal questions were being examined by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, along with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` What they're saying is that it's unprecedented to do that,'' she said in reference to potential <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> testimony. North is charged with conspiring with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to illegally divert more than $ 12 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Bushes planned to relax in seclusion until late Monday, and were expecting to be joined by no friends or aides, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. No announcements were expected before Tuesday on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choices for energy secretary and the new Cabinet-rank post of drug czar, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team. While speculation continued to swirl around former <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> as a potential pick for that post, the president-elect spent Friday meeting with his designee for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, and with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, currently the ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on U.S.-Israeli relations and they discussed the current <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process, said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Substance of his private meeting and luncheon with <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was not disclosed. While several names have been mentioned as possible choices for energy secretary, those of <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> and former Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., were said by transition sources to be the leading contenders at week's end <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> program, who had been mentioned earlier as a contender for the energy job, has told friends he would not be selected For the Cabinet-level post of drug czar, created last year by congressional legislation, the name of Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> has been mentioned in several reports. However, <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, said Friday that the commissioner has received no query from nor had any official contact with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office is expected to announce a flurry of White House staff positions, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign operative <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON> as political director. Many names have surfaced as candidates for energy secretary, and sources said the decision is being held up in part by strong lobbying within the transition office for one or another candidate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants someone with capabilities to deal with the pressing problem of nuclear waste disposal and other nuclear safety questions. Transition sources said <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who served as the first energy secretary when President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appointed him, and earlier as secretary of defense under <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, was getting serious attention. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office said Friday he would have no comment on the matter. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s office also refused comment, but a source in the office of one of his key boosters, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has remained one of the top two contenders for he post The independent-minded <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> would be a controversial choice, given opposition to him by industry leaders and his affiliation with the trouble-plagued energy policies of the Carter presidency. He was energy secretary when gasoline lines reappeared in the summer of 1979, and resigned thereafter. He helped shape policy against which <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned in 1980, and large parts of which they dismantled _ a massive government effort to develop unconventional sources of energy, a so-called windfall profits tax on crude oil, help for the poor faced with higher fuel bills and continued price controls on natural gas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his campaign urged complete decontrol of natural gas. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who represented a chemicals - and refining-intensive district around <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, is a lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 He is backed my many in the oil industry, which lost 150,000 jobs in the price collapse of recent years. Also frequently mentioned for the energy post is <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who revived the nearly abortive `` superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program in 1983, and presided over a quintupling of the program. Meanwhile, transition officials have told <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` fully satisfied with his performance and has no intention of replacing him,'' <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said Friday. Many had expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> at the helm of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in order to improve relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s deregulatory approach to the telecommunications and broadcasting industries has made few friends among Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.

 A gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty salon and released all but one during a 24-hour siege was shot and killed by a police sniper Friday after threatening to detonate a bomb in a suitcase. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was shot by a SWAT team sniper about 2:45 p.m. Friday at the beauty salon and all of the hostages were safe, Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadman </PERSON> said. A bomb squad was called in to deal with the suitcase. `` It did not explode when they attempted to detonate,'' Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> said. `` All indications that they had at the time was that it had the makings of a bomb. I ca n't tell you whether there was an explosive device in there or not.'' Police said they had believed <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> had a 9mm pistol but found he had a 9mm look-alike pellet gun. Police said <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> probably could not have killed anyone with it. `` We believe Mr. <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> was suffering from severe mental problems'' and was under psychiatric care, <PERSON> Wadman </PERSON> said. Early in the standoff, police said the hostage-taking occurred as the result of a botched holdup, but later said they did n't know why the camouflage-jacketed <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> entered the Possibilities salon about 3 p.m. Thursday. Police sealed off the neighborhood and the gunman released four people, including a young boy, police said. After negotiating through the night, he freed three women Friday. His final hostage, a woman, was freed apparently unharmed after he was shot. Police would not release the names of the hostages, but relatives and friends said three of the final four were <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, 28, and shop employees <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> <PERSON> Lordemann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhlmann </PERSON>, 18. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> was shot while trying to pick up a package he had demanded from police that was placed by the door. At a news conference, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said police decided to shoot <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> if it became possible because they believed he had a suitcase bomb with a `` pressure point'' that would detonate if he touched it. `` About 6 this morning, negotiations deteriorated seriously because they found out at that time there was a great likeliehood there was a bomb or the makings of a bomb or a bomb apparatus in a suitcase,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. Police evacuated bystanders west of the former bank building and moved reporters and photographers a distance away because of fears they could be hurt if a bomb was detonated. <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>, a 1985 graduate of <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for two years. His father, Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Compo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, told the <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Globe-Gazette </PERSON> that his son recently received psychiatric treatment. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>'s grandfather, said of <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>, `` He's always been very passive and mild around us. This is the biggest surprise of my life and that's all I'm going to say.'' The gunman negotiated undisclosed demands with police, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said during a Friday news conference. He would not say what the demands were, but he did say the gunman had not asked for money. Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> said police knew `` quite a bit'' about the gunman, but would not elaborate. He had said the man had remained calm during negotiations. `` He is talking, so that's always a good sign,'' <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> said. `` He's not doing anything directly at this time to harm the people. ... If he starts harming people we will have to re-evaluate the situation.'' A minister and family members of the hostages were assisting police in negotiations. More than 40 family members gathered at a nearby house Thursday night and were taken to a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> center to meet with police chaplains and other clergy.

 Investigators have told Scottish police that the bomb that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was put aboard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The report said investigators are certain that luggage loaded on Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport was transferred on arrival at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> to the forward cargo hold of the doomed <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. It said scientists have established that the bomb exploded in that hold, causing the jumbo jet to disintegrate. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, changed planes at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and continued to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The jet crashed in the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> on Dec. 21 less than an hour after taking off from <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. The account said the hunt for those responsible is now centered in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> `` where a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist cell is known to have been operating for more than 18 months.'' It said the cell is known to be part of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s hardline Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and to have carried out two bombing attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military trains that serve <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The paper did not identify by name the source of its information. It said <LOCATION> Scottish </LOCATION> police officers who flew to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on Friday would be shown evidence of the terrorist unit's existence and are expected to be given access to a Palestinian man arrested by West German security forces two months ago. It did not identify the man but said he is suspected of being a senior figure in <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s organization. The paper noted that the Jibril group, in a statement in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Friday, denied any connection with the crash. But it said the denial was regarded skeptically by terrorism experts, who believed the group was trying to avoid possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military retaliation. An anonymous male caller claiming to represent a group called the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution telephoned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news agencies in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Friday to repeat a claim of responsibility and threaten further attacks. The blue-and-white nose cone of Flight 103 was removed from the Scottish countryside Friday so investigators can examine the `` symbol of this disaster'' for clues to the bomb. The search for wreckage expanded from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and surrounding countryside into the waters of the <PERSON> Solway </PERSON> <PERSON> Firth </PERSON>, said Deputy Chief Constable <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> of the regional police force. He said the coast guard was acting on an eyewitness report that something fell into the inlet, about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. The airplane's nose cone and cockpit, with its name, `` Clipper Maid of the Seas,'' still visible, had lain in a field beside a church for eight days, a silent reminder of the tragedy. `` The picture of this nose cone has been seen throughout the world,'' said police Chief Superintendent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` It has become a symbol of this disaster.'' On Friday helicopters and trucks hauled the cut-up wreckage to the Royal Aerospace Establishment 300 miles south at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> will examine it for clues about the bomb. Police roped off an area near the wreckage where relatives of crash victims can place flowers. The Times reported Friday that investigators believe the bomb's first trigger was a barometric device set to go off under a change of altitude This would activate the second trigger, an electronic timer, to make the bomb explode at a later time, it said. Terrorists developed the double detonator technique after some airports started putting cargo through pressure chambers which can detonate pressure-activated bombs, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The investigators have yet to establish whether a suitcase containing the bomb passed through <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s pressure chamber, setting off the timing device, or whether the timer was activated in flight,'' the newspaper said. The caller claiming to speak for the Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deports <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, son of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` there will be another present in the New Year for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The day after the crash, an anonymous caller claimed it was retaliation by the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution for downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> airliner by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in July. The group previously claimed responsibility for a July 1987 bombing in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that wounded <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir-Parviz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister under the shah. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to `` seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did this _ if you can ever find them.'' Police Chief Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who is leading the investigation in conjunction with <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's anti-terrorist squad and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said that besides the officers sent to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, others may be sent to `` other parts of the world.'' American airlines using four British airports were implementing tighter security procedures on orders from the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government, including tougher baggage inspections.

 A moderate earthquake shook <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> communities Friday afternoon, but no injuries or damages were reported, authorities said. The earthquake struck at 3:54 p.m. abou 15 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and measured 4.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The quake occurred on the <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> fault and was felt as far north as <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and 45 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A single increase in magnitude, as in from 5.5 to 6.5, means a tenfold increase of ground motion. A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> hit 8.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, killing 114 people.

<TEXT>
 Part of an artillery shell containing conventional explosives and depleted uranium was accidentally shipped to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper reported Friday. The test shell sat at the lab for four days in August 1987 before it was discovered, said the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Depleted uranium is incapable of causing a nuclear explosion and only slightly radioactive, but it is poisonous when inhaled. Officials at <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION>'s main facility in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, said the risk of a conventional explosion was very low. `` It did n't pose any danger,'' said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, on Friday. `` The thing is we just did n't follow the rules.'' The shell was shipped to the lab as unclassified freight from the <LOCATION> Tonopah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Test </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, where a clerk mixed it up with another shipment. The shell was to have remained there for a future shipment, where it would have been properly labeled. The wooden crate carrying the device should have been marked as classified package containing explosive and radioactive material, Hey said. It was supposed to be shipped to a secret weapons testing site at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, it was flown to the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> by a government contractor and carried to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> lab by a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> truck as a routine delivery. The shell was placed under armed guard after its discovery. `` It caused a lot of concern, and it was taken as an example of how things can go wrong,'' Hey said. Test range officials have since revised shipping rules.

 The Contra rebels on Friday proposed a new round of peace talks with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, to be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> under the auspices of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We believe that this could break the impasse,'' Contra director <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said at the Contra headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We are accepting one of their proposals.'' Talks between the U.S.-backed rebels have been stalled since June when negotiations broke up in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and the Contras refused to return to the country, saying they were being harassed. Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the shaky truce, and a cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid has sent many Contra troops across the border into refugee camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas have expressed willingness to meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on previous occasions, said <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> would be a natural forum for the peace talks. The Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally known, sent a telecopy of their proposal to the Sandinista foreign ministry in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> early Friday, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said, but have not yet received a response. `` The Resistance proposes that the point of departure of this round be the same proposals presented in June,'' <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said. `` The democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> followed by troops surrendering of arms.'' But he said the Contras were flexible and would be willing to change that agenda.

 Petting animals, singing for peace and a massive steak fry and rodeo have been added this year to the more traditional champagne toasts and party-horn tooting as ways of greeting the New Year. There also will be fake snow for the unusually unwintry <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and blankets for the homeless in usually warm <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. In the Smoky Mountains of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, at least 100 couples are planning to start off the New Year by hitching up with a new spouse, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, dubbed the `` marry-thon'' minister of the Smokies. `` This takes the cake. This weekend has turned into the second busiest time of the year,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Friday. He performed 113 marriages last Valentine's Day. `` We've got four ministers and three chapels going,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said of his interdenominational <ORGANIZATION> Gatlinburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> football fans in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for the Fiesta Bowl game Jan. 2 between the No 3 ranked Mountaineers and No. 1 ranked Notre Dame are planning the `` Superbowl of alumni parties,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A steak fry and private rodeo are planned Sunday for about 7,500 people, complete with fireworks, dancing and the Mountaineer mascot parading on the back of a bull. The event, at Rawhide, a Western theme park in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, is so massive it is being staged in shifts. About half the crowd will have dinner, while the other half is at the rodeo, and then they'll switch, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said In the home of the New Year's tradition synonymous with the chaos of the night's revelry, the ball to be dropped at the stroke of midnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Times Square will be different. The wrought-iron ball replaces the red apple used in recent years `` because it's a more universal symbol,'' said <PERSON> Tama </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Artkraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which created the new ball. The dropping of the ball began in 1908. New Yorkers who party at a downtown nightclub called B2 will be treated to a shower of dollar bills _ $ 5,000 worth _ that will rain onto the dance floor at midnight. A quick-handed partygoer might be able to recoup the $ 65 price of admission. At <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine, a free `` Concert For Peace'' includes a prayer for peace being read by actor <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and songs by folk singer <PERSON> Odetta </PERSON>. About 1,000 artists will exhibit and perform on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s public plazas and storefront stages for the city's 13th annual First Night celebration. `` It's an opportunity for everyone to come together to celebrate the city's cultural life and feel a part of it,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossley </PERSON>, the city's commissioner for arts and humanities. <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> will have a choice of First Night and Last Night celebrations. The fourth annual First Night in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> is expected to draw about 40,000 people for a variety of alcohol-free festivities. The Last Night is a farewell party at the 100-year-old Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet ballroom, which is closing for at least two years. At Patriots Square, a new downtown park in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, there will be space heaters and tents to keep some 1,000 partygoers warm as they watch fireworks and bands New Year's Eve. Low temperatures in recent days have been running in the 20s and 30s, unusually cold for this time of year. Those who attend are being asked to bring blankets for seating during the event, to then be distributed to the homeless. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where snow is routine for New Year's, the city of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> is manufacturing the powdery stuff on the <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> lawn for the ice sculptures to be featured in its First Night celebration New Year's Eve. The downtown area will be roped off to traffic so the thousands of celebrants can take in such events as band concerts, dances, puppet shows, chorales, storytelling and trick bike acts, climaxed by fireworks at midnight. Included in the First Night celebration in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, will be a petting farm featuring farm animals. The idea is to increase the understanding of agriculture among schoolchildren. And to remind partygoers to keep it a happy new year, <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is sponsoring a statewide `` Tie One On'' program to tie red ribbons on antennas and rearview mirrors as a reminder to motorists not to drink and drive. The program began Thanksgiving weekend and runs until the new year. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> plans to have 200 to 300 of it's 1,200 troopers on duty at any given time over this weekend `` Our policy is visibility,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. `` The more people we have out, the better it is,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, area hotels are offering weekend party packages that include dinner, entertainment, champagne, overnight accommodations and a New Year's Day brunch. `` People are very verbal about not drinking and driving,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, director of catering for the Hilton Hotel in downtown <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. `` They do n't want to worry about it. ...

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for the first time Friday suspended payment on its $ 16.5-billion foreign debt for three months, when the government is to obtain a new loan to meet the payments. Treasury Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>, who announced the decision, said the country's creditors agreed to the suspension. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> was the only Latin American country up to now that had not restructured its debt or suspended its payments. The minister said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> will receive in April an international loan of $ 1.7 billion that will ensure it will have the funds needed to pay interest and principal on the foreign debt until 1990. The 90-day moratorium means <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> will not pay $ 300 million, which can be used for economic development programs, he told a news conference. The $ 300 million will be paid after <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> receives the additional loan, he said. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> had asked for a $ 1.85 billion loan in negotiations with international bankers to pay its foreign debt. Political leaders and economic analysts had recommended that President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government renegotiate the foreign debt under more favorable terms. In recent years, 40 percent of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s income from exports has been spent to service the debt. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week approved a law making it easier for the government to renegotiate the debt with its creditors, saying it was impossible to continue paying the debt under the current schedule.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Grenada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Justice J.O.F. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, has died, leaving in limbo the appeal of 14 defendants convicted in the 1983 murder of leftist Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was overthrown and shot by a firing squad as a result of factional feuding in his government. A Marxist junta took power, leading to an invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, joined by seven Eastern Caribbean nations that provided token forces. The junta in turn was overthrown. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, 76, died Wednesday in his native <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>. A former chancellor of the judiciary in <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, he was admitted to <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> this month after returning from <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, where he also was treated for an undisclosed illness. He is to be buried in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> on Monday. Legal sources here, speaking on the condition of anonymity, predicted that the entire appeal proceedings will have to be held from the beginning as result of <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' death and the need to appoint a new appeal court president. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> had recently chided defense and prosecution lawyers for tardiness in proceeding with the appeal. `` If one of the judges were to die, the whole appeal will have to be heard again,'' the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Guyana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> had quoted <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> had not been in good health for some time and appeared to have had a premonition of his death. He remarked during a hearing of the Bishop appeal on Dec. 9, `` I am living on borrowed time.'' Hearings began on May 30 on the appeal of 14 former members of <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s New Jewel Movement and the revolutionary government who were convicted in <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s murder. Since then, the hearings had taken up a total of 27 days. Proceedings had been adjourned until Jan. 28. It was expected that a judgment would be handed down by summer. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' death means this timetable will have to be revised to find a replacement for <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> and to give the new president time to study the court records of the murder trial.

 <PERSON> Isamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON>, the renowned American sculptor whose work graces museums, gardens and parks around the world, died Friday after a brief illness. He was 84. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON>, whose work blended the esthetics of East and West, was best known for monumental public sculpture but also designed furniture and lamps, stage sets, gardens, fountains, playgrounds and worked in several artistic media. He received the National Medal of Arts from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House in June 1987. `` He was one of the most important artists of the 20th century,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>. `` His career had an extraordinary range.'' Among his works are the gleaming steel <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a 28-foot red cube that stands on one of its corners in front of a lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bank and the Sunken Garden at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> He also designed the <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> garden in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and two bridges for <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>'s Peace Park. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> worked in many materials including wood, bronze and galvanized steel, but his major sculptures are made of stone: basalt, granite and marble. He is represented in the permanent collections of such major American museums as the Metropolitan, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and Modern in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost its greatest living sculptor,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardwell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Isamu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noguchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` Of course he was much more than a sculptor _ he was a designer of spaces, stage sets, gardens, fountains and the decorative arts. He was a great thinker and visionary.'' `` Art was it. He wrote a lot, but it was about art,'' <PERSON> Wardwell </PERSON> said. `` He was very much an innovator and not a follower,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> once said he was `` suspicious of the whole business of style _ again it is a form of inhibition.'' <ORGANIZATION> Wardwell </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> died at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at 2 a.m. Friday of heart failure. At the time of his death, he had just returned from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and was working on several large marble sculptures among other projects, including the Bayfront Park in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a memorial to the Challenger astronauts. He had just been commissioned to do a major park for the city of <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but spent much time in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, including his formative years, and he employed numerous artisans at a large workshop in Takamatsu on the Japanese island of <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>. The son of a Japanese poet and an American writer, he was born in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Nov. 17, 1904, but two years later his family took him to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He returned alone to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1918 and went to school in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as a pre-medical student in 1922, but dropped out in favor of sculpture studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Leonardo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Da </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vinci </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, now defunct. He moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1928 and became a studio assistant for <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brancusi </PERSON> for six months. During that time, his earliest works were made. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1929 and had his first one-man show at the <ORGANIZATION> Eugene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>. He survived on the sales of a few bronze head portraits and on grants, including a Guggenheim fellowship in 1927, which enabled him to travel to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where he studied drawing, ink-brush painting and pottery. One of his first competitive successes was a 1938 commission for the 10-ton, stainless-steel relief above the entrance to The Associated Press Building at Rockefeller Center. The piece, one of his few representational pieces, depicts five journalists at work. His sculptures were often smooth-surfaced vaguely biological forms that remind some scholars of the surrealistic paintings of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON> and of primitive Japanese `` haniwa'' figures. In later years his work became more geometric, while retaining organic imagery. The naturalistic style was once described in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as `` a restrained vocabulary of organic forms ranging from playful biomorphs and abstract figures to subtle mounds, polished rings and massive boulders.'' He said he was fascinated by `` abandoned stones'' that `` allow me to enter into their life's purpose.'' His works are found outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, the Art Gallery of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, the Rijksmuseum Kroller-Muller in <LOCATION> Otterlo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bayerische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vereinsbank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> had an active social life, but lived modestly in a small apartment.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were subpoenaed Friday as defense witnesses in the trial of retired Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the Iran-Contra affair. `` We did receive it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` There's one for the president and one for the vice president. We received it at mid-afternoon.'' The subpoenas were received by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, the executive assistant to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. A statement released by the White House press office in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is on vacation, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has received a subpoena seeking the president's testimony at the criminal trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The subpoena also seeks the discovery of certain personal records of the president. The subpoena was not an unanticipated development. `` It raises significant legal and constitutional questions which are currently being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and counsel to the president,'' the statement said. `` It would be unprecedented for a president to appear as a witness at a criminal trial and it's premature to speculate on the final decision that will ultimately be taken, but historical precedent suggests any relevant information could be provided through written questions and answers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday editions that unidentified White House and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they will fight the subpoenas. The newspaper also cited an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official as saying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> viewed the subpoena effort as an attempt to pressure him into granting a pardon to North before he leaves office. The official said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had not changed his view that the legal process should run its course. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, a White House spokesman, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had known since Wednesday that it was likely he would be subpoenaed. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday morning that the subpoena would be delivered during the afternoon, <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides confirmed that the president-elect had received a subpoena Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legal counsel <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> informed the vice president Friday morning that the subpoena would be delivered that afternoon, and she did not know <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction She said he was going ahead with his weekend of relaxation at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and planned no meetings to discuss the trial matter. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, she said, did have conferences on the matter Friday, but she said she could give no further details. `` The receipt of this is not an unanticipated development, but it is unprecedented,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press aide <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take office Jan. 20 and thus will be president when the North trial begins Jan. 31. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, is facing conspiracy and theft charges in the Iran-Contra affair. He is charged with conspiring with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to illegally divert more than $ 12 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. National security concerns have placed in jeopardy <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial on the major conspiracy and theft charges, which involve extensive use of classified material. North's attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, did not go into any detail on why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were subpoenaed. `` What I do say is this: As you know, a defense lawyer has an obligation to issue a subpoena for every person who has relevant information about a matter in court,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` The president himself has indicated he has relevant information.'' Attorneys for the vice president, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were looking into the `` constitutional legal issues'' raised by the subpoenas, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. In 1973, President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> received a subpoena to turn over <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tape recordings of conversations with top aides in connection with the Watergate scandal. Although <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was not required to testify, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had to release the tapes. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said she could not say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attorneys would fight the subpoena. `` What they're saying is that it's unprecedented to do that,'' she said in reference to potential <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> testimony. The issue of how much he knew about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities with the Contras and the diversion of funds from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was the subject of contradictory testimony during congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra matter. The subpoena could force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to disclose information that he previously has refused to divulge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly has refused to say what he discussed with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regarding matters involved in the Iran-Contra affair, other than that he had reservations about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concluded last year that there was no evidence <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew of the diversion plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he did not know of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret operation to supply the Contras during the congressional ban on aid, although his national security adviser <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was well informed on the matter, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met three times with <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, one of the key figures helping <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the operation. Questions also were raised about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that he did not know of the arms-for-hostages nature of the dealings with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> until late 1986, when his chief of staff indicated that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> operative <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on this aspect in May of 1986. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he was told about the Israeli side of the operation, not the American activity in the same vein.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s `` The Power Game'' comes to life beginning tonight in a four-part series that is a kind of video Cliff Notes for the 725-page best-seller about the machinations of official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Pegged to run just before the inauguration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the PBS series is also something of a scorecard for interested viewers who want to keep track of the players as the new game begins. Produced by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, the series of one-hour programs is fast-paced and entertaining. It boasts interviews with an impressive array of current and former officials _ including President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ but avoids too many talking-head interviews by blending in news footage and flashy graphics. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Pulitzer Prize-wining print reporter and author -LRB- `` The Russians'' -RRB- is a pleasant host and experienced interviewer. The series hones the book down into four topics _ `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` The Unelected'' and `` The Presidency.'' The installments run in that order, Monday through Thursday. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> coming in, the final two segments _ `` The Unelected,'' about the power of staff and the news media, and `` The Presidency'' _ are especially interesting. In `` The Presidency,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> outlines the three things he says a successful president must immediately do: _ Set a simple agenda <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, he says, cluttered his agenda, confusing his would-be supporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. _ Form coalitions <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were good image-makers who had problems working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had the added problem of a post-Watergate and post-Vietnam <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> filled with mavericks unbeholden to the leadership. _ Create an image <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s team masterfully managed the media. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> got a late interview with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for inclusion in the `` The Presidency.'' A transcript was provided to television critics. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has read <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s book, he does n't seem to buy its theories. `` It seems to me, listening to you, I hear a few echoes of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` That may sound strange to you. I do n't mean in terms ...'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interrupts, `` That sounds very strange!'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> continues, `` What I mean is that when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> came in, he wanted to do something about the environment. He wanted to do something about education. He wanted to do something about the deficit, and on and on. And one of the problems he had was focusing the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He confused the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and he confused the country.'' `` Please do n't suggest to me that if I do n't say that _ if I throw in the question of trying to do something better on fighting narcotics that that means I'm not interested in the deficit, the one major, you know, economic problem facing us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> argued. `` But I think to be so unipurpose that you say you're gon na do nothing else until the deficit is solved is myopic.'' The main theme in the four programs is the phenomenon of `` floating'' power _ from the presidency to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the news media and staff members. From <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to its staff on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. From the news media back to the president. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> shows how <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff pursued the Strategic Defense Initiative, or so-called `` Star Wars,'' without informing high-level advisers, some of whom talk of learning about the proposed massive shift in defense policy only days or hours before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced it to the nation in a 1983 speech. A powerful media set the agendas for Watergate and later the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> advance man <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henkel </PERSON> describes an amazing feat of media management when he describes scheduling <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stopoff in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on his summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> just so <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s helicopter would arrive on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> later that night at the top of the evening newscasts. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> that he was delighted by the documentary experience and hopes to get the money to produce an examination of the first 100 days of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, `` to take ` The Power Game' analysis forward and apply it to this new administration.'' `` Even though you get a good audience with 100,000 copies of the hardback and several hundred thousand with the paperback, to be able to reach several million people at once with a concentrated dose in terms of this kind of material, I'm just enough of an idealist and fresh enough to the game to want to throw a lot more into it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 Two riveting mysteries unfold in Thursday night's <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie, `` The Man in the Brown Suit.'' Who killed the sultry chanteuse? And how many more ensembles can <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> produce from her tiny carry-on bag? Advertised as an `` intriguing mystery-drama,'' the movie is intriguing in only one regard: Can dramatic improbability really go any further? Why <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON>, playing a flaky tourist stuck in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, wants to stalk a murderer is never explained. How a car moving at about 8 mph can kill somebody is equally perplexing. The only thing that makes perfect sense is why <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> all agreed to star in this clunker _ a neat chance to visit <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for free. Based, more or less, on a 1924 <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> novel, `` The Man in the Brown Suit'' focuses on a couple of murders _ or maybe one was an accident? _ some missing diamonds, a handsome stranger in a brown suit, several suspects, a kidnapping, an EZ-Escape jail cell, a half-dozen lurking-in-the-shadows bad guys and a whole bunch of romantic European film locations. <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Beddingfeld </PERSON>, a camera-toting traveler lost in the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> airport with hardly any luggage and nothing much to do except whimper. Before you can say `` plot device,'' a man at the airport who smells like musk _ no kidding _ is hit by that deadly slow-moving car, and we're on our merry way. On the dead man's body is a piece of paper that _ surprise! _ might be a clue. After the handsome stranger _ the one in the brown suit _ drops the note he has stolen from the corpse, Beddingfeld scoops it up. `` I do n't want to leave now,'' she says. `` The adventure has n't started yet.'' Using sleuthing skills that would make <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> relax in her retirement, Beddingfeld books a cabin on a small cruise ship and sets to work. On board, lucky for her, are all of the key players in the unsolved chanteuse murder and a related diamond theft. Below decks somewhere must also be a <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, as <PERSON> Beddingfeld </PERSON> never seems to run out of fresh outfits. Suspects include the man in the brown suit -LRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> -RRB-, dashing English businessman Sir <PERSON> Eustace </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedler </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> -RRB-, his assistant <PERSON> Underhill </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Nickolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> -RRB-, oft-married socialite <PERSON> Suzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON> -RRB- and a creepy priest -LRB- <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> -RRB-. Special acting points should be given to <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> for working up new dialects especially for this project. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> sounds like <PERSON> Quasimodo </PERSON> on a caffeine overdose, and <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> manages a brilliant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> impersonation. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> takes the smarter route, spending most of the movie hiding behind dark sunglasses. If he could have seen the finished movie, he probably would have worn a hat and fake moustache, too. The creaky script, by <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, runs low on action and overflows with talk. When <PERSON> Beddingfeld </PERSON> jots down a list of suspects, she has to announce each person's motive _ the film's director, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grint </PERSON>, could n't impart such basic information with his camera. Beddingfeld and <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> eventually join forces. `` Oh Lord,'' says <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, `` this is so exciting I feel just like one of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s Angels! The closer Beddingfeld moves to solving the mystery, such as it is, the more endangered her life becomes. After <PERSON> Beddingfeld </PERSON> is almost pushed overboard into the sea, she survives a plunge into a waterfall. Tough private detective that she is, the watery near-deaths only strengthen her determination. Does she solve the crime? Does anybody care? The rewards of `` The Man in the Brown Suit'' do not rest with the delivery of justice. Instead, the fascination is found in the preposterous depths to which this story slinks. All-star camp, after all, is all-star camp.

 Economists will tell you they make their prognostications on the basis of `` the data,'' not gut feelings about the economy. But some attending last week's conference here of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> were bold enough to venture guesses on the fate of the economy without their usual battery of numbers at hand. Yes, there were scores of seminars during the conference on such esoteric topics as `` Empirical Analysis of Price Determinants'' -LRB- and we wonder why <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> ca n't understand simple rules of economics -RRB-. But there was also a fair amount of cocktail and luncheon chatter about what economists might call `` exogenous'' _ or outside _ factors affecting the ebb and flow of the economy. Principal among them, politics _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s politics, to be more precise. Theories about how the president-elect will manage the economy span the usual spectrum, as you might expect. Yet a predominantly hopeful theory is emerging in some quarters, based on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition performance While some pundits have criticized his recently announced Cabinet selections as bland, others are impressed by the mix of key holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and new choices aimed at mending fences with old opponents. So far, these optimists say, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done several things right. When the markets reacted negatively in the days following his election, he moved swiftly to name his `` economic team,'' long before settling on advisers for defense and other areas. Among his earliest choices was <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to remain as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, a pick that was applauded by those who admired <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s work as head of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> committee investigating the October 1987 stock market crash. Having <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary and an architect of past accords to stabilize the dollar in world markets, as secretary of state also was seen as a plus by some economic experts. Later additions that have drawn praise are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to chief economic adviser, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to agriculture secretary, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to commerce secretary and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> move was viewed as especially significant since it not only installed an experienced hand at the wheel of labor, but also helped smooth the ruffled feathers of the secretary-designate's husband, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>. Other rough spots in the road that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly patched were in He initiated a meeting with his defeated challenger, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and also offered to make ex-House Speaker <PERSON> Tip </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> the next ambassador to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Neither of the high-profile Democrats will end up serving the new administration, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s thoughtful gestures were n't lost on the loyal opposition. The optimists say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s style may help him make strides on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where Democratic cooperation will be crucial to keeping his pledge of no new taxes. One economist at last week's conference, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said he predicts a great `` Rose Garden compromise'' along about April that will put a two-year federal budget in place, restrain the deficit and maybe even avoid new taxes. That certainly would provide the so-called `` soft landing'' the economy needs to avert recession in 1989. Non-believers would say such fine-tuning went out a long time ago, about the time <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> used sky-high interest rates to squelch inflation. Still, the prospect of striking a delicate balance in economic policy, between bust and boom, is intriguing _ particularly now, a few weeks before the inauguration when hope springs eternal.

<HEAD>Operation Rescue Head: Create `Social Tension' To Change Laws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Where most people list their job experiences, <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s resume brags, `` Arrested 26 times in seven cities.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> complains it's out-of-date. `` It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activist said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where the latest protests against abortion are being planned. Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion a high-profile issue again. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion clinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until police carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> says he is trying to produce the `` social tension'' necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960s civil rights protest as a model. `` He's the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of a movement,'' said <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brignola </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortion drive. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s critics claim Operation Rescue, so named because followers try to `` rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women's rights `` The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people. They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing human beings,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> jails during the five-day Democratic convention. Since then, demonstrations have spread to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and still more cities. The activists want the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated 1.6 million women have abortions each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used car salesman who once wanted to be a rock star. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, began their crusade in 1984 by standing in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out of entering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an office that offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down baby clothes. `` God clicked a light on in my head and said it was n't enough to just be against child-killing, that I had to do something about it,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who's selling his auto dealership because he is too busy with Operation Rescue. Critics concede <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has a mesmerizing personality. He even tries to convert relatives at family reunions, said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, his aunt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quit high school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, who is communications director for the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> chapter of Planned Parenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequently target. She stressed that she does not speak for the organization about her nephew. `` He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s transformation into a born-again Christian `` He came back a totally changed personality. It was more like a cult reaction than a spiritual quest.'' Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesman have calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child and three foster children. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessment that `` he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention. To <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, Operation Rescue is nothing new She said anti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and glued the clinic's door shut four or five times. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himself to a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for 22 days for refusing to pay a $ 60 fine. `` It does n't matter what you say to him. There is no reason involved,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` He does n't care about women. I think he really hates women.'' Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION> clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-present demonstrators at shouting distance. `` They really want to make it personal,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has shouted at her, `` How many babies did you murder today?'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being `` too nice'' during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friend like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> into not working hard for its goal. `` We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' he said. `` That's not an adequate response to murder. A logical response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the victim.'' The lean, bushy-haired <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> expects and even hopes his demonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue is responsible for 11,000 arrests this year and predicts 500,000 will be arrested in the next year. There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified. `` In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their own beliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent children murdered,'' he said. `` That's like saying, ` Why ca n't a white man follow his own conscience concerning owning a black slave? Why ca n't a German follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?''' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has attracted some prominent supporters, including former presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who said he backs `` any means short of violence'' to stop abortion. If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said, they could change abortion laws in six months because the political system is not built to deal with mass protests. Yard dismisses <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> as a `` puppet'' groomed for the role of point man in the latest anti-abortion offensive. `` Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. `` The reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings -LRB- of abortion clinics -RRB- and Operation Rescue is that people do n't believe <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I know is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.'' At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted. Pinned to the wall is a large map of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with `` abortion mills'' dotted in red. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> distractedly complains to a staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will take him to a television appearance. As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from his desk, saying `` that's too casual for someone trying to change world history.'' He adds, chuckling: `` It's comical, really. I think God has a sense of humor. Do n't you think it's rather funny that a former used car salesman is heading such a movement?''

<HEAD>Crusading African Editor Targets Corrupt Politicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a continent where newspapers are not generally known for their crusading zeal, a Zimbabwean editor has become a national hero and his tabloid a sellout for exposing high-level corruption. The price for <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyarota </PERSON>'s principles has been high. A Cabinet minister threatened him with detention. Two of his staff were allegedly assaulted by a senior politician, and President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> branded two of his reporters enemies of the country. But <PERSON> Nyarota </PERSON>, editor of The Chronicle in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s second largest city, <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, remains unbowed. `` Where corruption exists, at whatever level, and we find out, we'll expose it,'' said the 37-year-old editor, a former schoolteacher who broke into journalism with a muck-raking weekly newspaper in the l970s. The Chronicle's exposes are small change in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where widespread graft infects most levels of society. But the stories are avidly read by Zimbabweans who have long suspected some of their leaders of dipping into the national till. In December, The <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> published the names of several Cabinet members, security chiefs and ranking bureaucrats who obtained cars and trucks directly from the state-run Willowvale assembly plant, then evidently resold them at a huge profit. The Chronicle's front-page report was headlined `` Willowgate Scandal.'' Private buyers who order cars must wait years for them, and the demand has created a flourishing black market in which vehicles fetch as much as five times their book value. Defense Minister <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkala </PERSON> was one of those questioned by The <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant editor, <PERSON> Davison </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruziva </PERSON>, on the whereabouts of a car he bought. <PERSON> Nkala </PERSON> demanded to know how the paper knew he had the vehicle, and he threatened to send soldiers to detain <PERSON> Maruziva </PERSON> and his boss. `` Where did you get that information?'' the minister reportedly asked. `` That information is supposed to be with the police and the president. I want that information here in my office ... If you do not travel here I will use the army to pick you up ... I am not the kind to play with.'' Two days later, most of The Chronicle's front page was devoted to further details of <LOCATION> Willowgate </LOCATION>. The Chronicle, owned like all other daily and Sunday newspapers in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> by the government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, also quoted the defense minister as saying he and other politicians were considering suing for libel. `` <PERSON> Nyarota </PERSON> keeps pestering ministers, wanting to know whether we still have our cars,'' <PERSON> Nkala </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I am still angry that I can be pestered by little <PERSON> Nyarota </PERSON>.'' The Chronicle, usually 12 pages printed on a 50-year-old press, has an average daily paid circulation of 65,000 mainly in the <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. For the issue that splashed the first Willowgate report, the press worked overtime to produce 100,000 copies. All of them quickly sold out. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, the only daily published in the capital of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, has a nationwide circulation of 135,000, but many readers say it lacks the bite of The Chronicle. The 4,000 copies of The Chronicle sent each day to <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, 275 miles away, are quickly snatched up from street vendors. Some entrepreneurs photocopy the paper and sell it in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>'s markets, bus stations and suburbs. Chronicle editors say they could sell thousands more copies in <LOCATION> Matabeland </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> were it not for a newsprint shortage. Zimbabweans have reacted angrily to reports of corruption by leaders popularly elected on unfulfilled promises of giving <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s 8.2 million people a fair share of the public pie. Thousands of university students, protesting mounting reports of official graft, clashed violently with riot police in October. Trade unions, church groups and individual readers have bombarded Chronicle editors with statements and letters demanding independent investigations into the source of some politicians' wealth. Many live in opulence beyond their means. `` That you are courageous enough to ignore the threats against you, for exposing massive corruption, is something the public has long waited for,'' wrote one reader. `` For our leaders to deplore the muzzling of the press in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and yet advocate locking you up, is a clear example of the sheer hypocrisy we are witness to daily.''

 For students working in a miniature factory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Rolla </ORGANIZATION>, the future of American business is now. `` When our students go into industry, they will have state-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions about expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the workplace, said <PERSON> Sema </PERSON> <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON>, designer of the futuristic business laboratory. Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging laboratory. The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $ 120,000, is the only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced such programs in the country. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Akas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> has created `` a model for similar laboratories ... Students can see how the factory of the future operates.'' The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer. In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent, 4-foot metal sentry. The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on a pivoting base. The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. The robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe or milling machine. The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court. The machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting shops, Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said. Students learn to program a computer and automated machines linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation _ retrieving raw materials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed to supply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing the parts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into finished products at the lathe. Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass. But the product is less important than the process. Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation and financial consulting. In the factory of the future, according to the university's model, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines `` Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said, referring to programming that allows components such as the automated storage system to `` talk to'' the computer that controls the manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of parts. Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even from industries where robots and automated machines have become almost commonplace. There, she said, robots perform specific tasks in `` islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the production line. Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said automation is widespread in the automobile industry, but she would like to see it expanded. `` It should be used in any industry,'' she said. `` It's difficult to justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can be easily justified. `` At least our students will be aware of the enhancements and developments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers and managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said. A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to altering it to create a new product. Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said the student identified what new production components were necessary and determined how they could be integrated into the system. A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will allow the system to diagnose itself. The system could be programmed to recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled component, much as human managers would react. Graduate student <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchelt </PERSON> said the equipment he is using is on the cutting edge of manufacturing. `` Truthfully, I ca n't say that I was expecting this level of expertise,'' he said. `` I know that our lab is one of the best of its kind in an educational institution.'' The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on computing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork. `` For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Alptekin </PERSON> said she is continually fine-tuning the lab. This past year, the original robot was replaced with one able to perform more tasks. She now is considering purchasing a robot with vision sophisticated enough to act as an inspector. The university spent $ 30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987. An estimated $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 was earmarked in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recently pledged $ 1.2 million in computer equipment and software to the university as part of an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across the country `` Studies show that there's a severe national shortage of instructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will benefit because we will be helping to train the -LRB- computer-integrated manufacturing -RRB- workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s once-powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finds itself increasingly deserted by the left and sharply repressed by the right while it pursues revolutionary tactics long abandoned by other opposition forces. Parties once closely aligned with the Communists, including important sectors of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, are taking pains to distance themselves from the pro-Moscow group while the country prepares for an end to 15 years of right-wing military rule. Many Socialists spent more than a decade in exile in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the 1973 military coup that brought <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to power. Their political views were moderated by reforms in that region, where socialist groups shed their Leninist tendencies. But most Chilean Communists sought refuge in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Upon their return, they have employed a revolutionary rhetoric that many ex-comrades find antiquated and offensive. `` While Communism is changing around the world, the Chilean party goes back to 1917 and declares itself pro-Bolshevik,'' Socialist ex-senator <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnake </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` That leaves them entrapped in a political-military apparatus.'' <PERSON> Schnake </PERSON> was referring to a recent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> document presented at its first national congress in 19 years. In it, the party declared: `` Our policy of open rebellion remains in effect.'' It was a reiteration of a party policy statement in 1983 that formally proclaimed a strategy of `` popular rebellion'' and `` the use of legitimate violence and all forms of struggle'' against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schnake </PERSON> participated in a coalition of Socialists, Communists and other leftist groups led by <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who was elected president in 1970 and ousted by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. He now calls the Communists `` one of the most difficult things to explain in Chilean politics today.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, objected to criticism of the Communists' militant stance but admits the strategy had created some problems with the rest of the opposition. `` But we do not feel isolated,'' he insisted. `` We are an important element in the fight to restore democracy.'' The country's non-Marxist opposition led a peaceful cmpaign for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in an Oct. 5 referendum, which asked voters whether the 73-year-old army commander's rule should be extended until 1997. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> characterized the vote as a farce and insisted only mass struggle would topple the government. Only after it appeared evident <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would lose, a few weeks before the election, did the party come out in favor of a `` no'' vote. The Communists were not invited to join thea broad-based opposition coalition that led the campaign, and they remain ostracized while the coalition prepares for open elections. Socialist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a leader of the coalition, characterized the Communists' position as `` contradictory.'' `` They need to clearly define themselves, to the whole country,'' he said. `` The country ca n't understand a party that says it wants to become legal and thinks that's compatible with a bunch of kids attacking a police station.'' He referred to a recent attack on a rural police outpost in which one officer was killed. A guerrilla band that claimed responsibility is widely believed to be related to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The government calls the group `` the armed hand of the Communist Party.'' <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON> denied his party encourages terrorism and claimed recent terrorist actions were the work of government security services to put the blame on the Communists. `` We do not want to exclude anybody,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. `` The Communists want to participate? Very well. Then, let them to adhere to our strategies.'' The Communist Party is officially outlawed and has suffered fierce repression by the military since the coup. Party spokesmen say 17 members of its central committee and dozens of other party militants have been killed during military rule. Some political analysts contend the repression has contributed to the party's resistance to reform, by forcing it to function clandestinely. The party convention, expected to last several months, began in December but was being held secretly for fear of government sanctions, spokesmen said. Some party `` public spokesmen,'' such as Sanfuentes, have operated more or less openly, however, appearing at public events and meeting with the news media. `` Popular mobilization is still essential to put an end to the dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON> said. The expression `` popular mobilization'' is used by Communists to describe labor strikes and street demonstrations. <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON> said his party is not immune to changes in communism around the world, but he claimed that those changes, including `` perestroika'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have been misunderstood by non-adherents. `` They try to show ` perestroika' as a reverse for the Russian Revolution,'' he said. `` That's not so. It's exactly the other way around. The idea is to rescue the best part of the revolution, to make more democracy and more socialism.'' `` In that sense, our party is going through a process of renewal which is deeply revolutionary,'' <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON> added. `` And that process has not been prompted by events in other parts of the world or in other parties, but by the reality in our own country.''

 The inventors of the unbundled stock unit are confident they can tie up enough loose ends for still-unconvinced investors to make February's planned offering of the new security a success. But the developers who initially pitched the securities as a way to unlock hidden values in a company by breaking a share of its stock into three tradable components are now emphasizing the value of the three pieces as a package. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallatin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executive who oversaw the development of the unbundled stock unit, insists the new marketing approach simply reflects an effort to point out what may have been an underappreciated reason for making the switch from common stock to unbundled stock unit. `` There seems to be no question that long before the important date, there will be more than enough people comfortable with it'' to proceed with the offerings, he said. The important date may be in early February after the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> completes its review of the proposal and the offerings begin. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and four clients _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ said Dec. 5 that they planned to offer shareholders a chance to exchange about $ 5.6 billion in common stock for unbundled stock units. The precise exchange ratio has not been announced, and some investors are pushing to get one unbundled unit for slightly less than a share of common. The unbundled stock unit consists of a 30-year bond paying interest equal to the company's current dividend, a preferred stock that will reflect any increase in the dividend and an equity appreciation certificate that will reflect stock price appreciation in excess of the bond's stated value. It is expected that each of the units will trade separately on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> along with the company's common stock and a unit that will combine the preferred stock and equity appreciation certificate. The stock exchange recently made a proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> that would allow the issuance of unbundled stock units with certain restrictions. The restrictions include limiting the total outstanding stock that can be converted into unbundled units to no more than 25 percent. In addition, the voting rights of the remaining stockholders should not be adversely affected by an exchange of stock for unbundled units and individual shareholders should be allowed to swap their shares without a shareholder vote. <PERSON> Gallatin </PERSON> said his firm has no objection to the exchange's recommendations, and noted that each of the four offerings proposed to date are in compliance <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> has been briefing institutional investors who are being counted on to be major participants in the market for unbundled stock units. Among the reservations that some investors have expressed are that the exchange will be taxable and that unbundled units carry no voting rights. Some have also questioned how liquid the market for the new securities will be and have found it difficult to place a value on the preferred and equity appreciation components of the unbundled unit. <LOCATION> Gallatin </LOCATION> said the taxability issue should not pose a problem for tax-exempt investors such as pension funds and may be an incentive for investors who may have a capital loss rather than a gain. Voting rights would be restored in the event of a takeover. In addition, <PERSON> Gallatin </PERSON> said those trying to place a value on the various pieces of the unbundled stock unit should consider the extras in the package as a whole. While companies can cut dividends, they are less likely to skip an interest payment and that is what the dividend becomes after the share of stock is traded for the unbundled stock unit. The bond has a face value after 30 years of about 2.5 times the current stock price with the potential for even more with the equity appreciation certificate. In an analysis of the Pfizer offering, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its experts `` have guardedly assigned a value of about 5-10 percent of the price of the common to these new guarantees which might be realized if one were to hold the pieces for 30 years.'' But they added that if investors do not consider the value of these provisions `` attractive enough to offset the lack of common voting rights and the potential liquidity problem, the offering may be untenable.'' Some investors want to wait until the new securities are in the market. In a recent report for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said `` the jury is still out on the probable success'' of the new securities and described initial reaction as mixed But they added, `` Were the reaction of market participants to remain favorable, the incentive would be strong for other companies to adopt the proposal.''

 In the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The Ryan White Story,'' look for a scene in a hospital in which the young AIDS victim talks to a friend named <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> is played by <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> youngster who took on fear, ignorance and the establishment in his determination to go to school despite being diagnosed as having the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> is a friend who died of AIDS. <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> -LRB- `` Witness'' -RRB- plays <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Producer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said it was director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzfeld </PERSON>'s idea to have <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> play <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was a natural,'' she said. `` He just understands. He has a sixth sense. I loved being around him. He's enriched my life. `` He's just turned 17, he drives a car. No one quite understands why he's fine, but he is. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> has determined to do well and have a good life. The lesson of the movie is overcoming adversity. It's not about AIDS, although that's what he has. `` I did n't want to make a movie about a boy dying of AIDS. I wanted to make a movie about a kid living with AIDS. Every movie you see about AIDS, the person dies. Even if <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> had died I would n't have him die in the movie But I knew he would n't die. I knew he'd hang in there. At the end of the movie, which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts Monday, there is another look at <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, plus his mother, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, and his sister, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> his sister. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> plays his attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzundza </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> his doctor and nurse, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabriskie </PERSON> his grandparents and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scolari </PERSON> an attorney representing the school. `` People wanted to be in this movie because it was about <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and about AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>. `` We were able to get music from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> because they all knew about <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>.'' `` The Ryan White Story'' is a `` feel-good'' movie. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is a hemophiliac who learned in 1984 that he had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. His school in <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, barred him. Many parents wrongly believed that their children could get the disease through casual contact with <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. `` A lot of people were terrified,'' said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>. `` That's why this picture is important. You ca n't get AIDS by casual contact. The fact that it polarized an entire town is a microcosm of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> is as apple pie as you can get. There were no good people or bad people. People wanted to protect their children. `` <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was bound and determined to go to school. They were bound and determined to keep him out. It could happen in any community. What made this a special case is that <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> went public with it. ` I ca n't go to school? Watch me.''' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> won a precedent-setting court decision and now attends school at his new home in <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said it took nearly three years to get the movie made after the project was dropped by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, then picked up by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's a long time to care about a movie,'' she said. `` But more important, I was concerned about <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. His health went up and down. I wanted to get it done so he could be a part of it. `` Many people called about the rights to <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s story. But nobody went to <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> and said, ` I want to make this movie,' except me. They did n't say yes right away. I sent them tapes of ` Adam' and ` Bill','' two other real-life movies she has produced. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s story was filmed in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the third movie <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Landsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has made there The others were `` A Stoning in <LOCATION> Fulham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'' for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and `` Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story'' for CBS. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> is now awaiting word from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> on another picture to be filmed there, `` Unspeakable Acts,'' about a child abuse case in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>'s movie `` Adam'' was about the murder-kidnaping of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, which caused his father to crusade for a law setting up a national clearinghouse for missing children, and `` Bill'' was about a mentally retarded man, played by <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, who was able to make it on his own.

<HEAD>Sickly Thrift Bailouts: Frenzy of Pre-New Year Deals Raise New
Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government bureaucrats think they had good reason to pop champagne corks early for their success at peddling some of the sickest insolvent savings and loan institutions before the New Year holiday. But congressional critics think the last laugh may belong to the slick financiers who bought them, risking little of their own money, gaining huge tax benefits and controlling a vast new source of assets. Once criticized for moving too sluggishly to solve the nation's thrift crisis, federal regulators intensified efforts this past week to sell at least 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls by the end of the year On Wednesday and Thursday alone, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 3,100 savings institutions, sold 22 of the insolvent thrifts it has been forced to take over because of mismanagement and bad loans. They included the first sale of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> thrift to foreign investors. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> unit of a Taiwanese concern, is acquiring eight institutions with assets worth $ 850 million. The bank board's biggest single sale was the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with more than $ 30 billion in assets, to a group controlled by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> takeover strategist, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, who will only have to put up $ 500 million in return for $ 1.7 billion of government aid. But the costliest to the government was the sale of five insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to an investment group headed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takeover strategist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For a $ 315 million investment of its own and $ 5.1 billion of federal aid, <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s group will obtain control of savings units with assets of $ 12.2 billion Part of the last-minute rush to sell sick thrifts was due to tax law changes that expire Sunday, halving the potential benefits to buyers. But the selling spree has raised new questions about whether the government is relinquishing too much in its effort to unload the problem. Concern also has intensified over many of the buyers, professional financiers who are n't necessarily interested in running these thrifts but consider them undervalued. `` The haste with which you are proceeding may prove to be short-sighted, irresponsible and ultimately unfair to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said in a letter to the bank board. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he intends to hold hearings in January to scrutinize these deals, especially the two largest bailouts. Bank board officials, who toasted the biggest deals with champagne, defended the massive infusion of money to salvage the bankrupt S & amp; Ls, saying it would cost taxpayers much more if they were closed, which would require the government to pay off the depositors. They also rejected the other alternative, continuing to run bankrupt institutions that are losing more money every day. Some thrift industry analysts said the situation reflects the extremely weak bargaining position held by the bank board, which does n't have enough money to shut down failed S & amp; Ls and does n't want to keep them. In the end, the government may have to settle for whoever is willing to buy. In other business and economic developments this past week: _ The government's economic statistics suggested a mixed picture going into 1989 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries will expand for the seventh straight year, strengthened by demand for exports and services. But its chief economic forecasting gauge turned down slightly and home sales hit an 18-month low in November, suggesting that rising interest rates are dampening growth. _ <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s record $ 650 million deal to settle criminal fraud charges began to hurt the company's business A federal judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> delayed a Drexel-financed takeover effort of <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> because of his concerns over the settlement, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> barred the firm from participating in its next bond sale. _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Paradyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 250 million, a move that reflected the telecommunications giant's new willingness to acquire other companies rather than develop new technology on its own Elsewhere in the takeover business, <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it would buy <ORGANIZATION> Rexene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 865.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> rejected a $ 698 million offer from the Centaur Partners investment group; and <ORGANIZATION> Avery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it was negotiating to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unit to a management-led investment partnership, a deal potentially worth more than $ 800 million.

 A year-end search for bargains among blue-chip issues propelled stock prices to a broad rally Thursday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.25 points to close at 2,182.68 _ less than a point below its 1988 closing high of 2,183.50, reached Oct. 21. The dollar ended lower against most major currencies in thin, volatile trading. Bond prices and yields were fairly stable.

However, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> abandoned the idea early this year after it found that the plan was too expensive to carry out, he said. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said in a statement late Thursday that the investor group, which also includes <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would pay $ 240 million to $ 250 million in cash for <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> as well as the assumption of the division's $ 560 million in debt. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said that if it reached agreement with the group, the deal would require the approval of its board, shareholders and bondholders, and would also require financing commitments. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would arrange for the financing, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> also announced plans earlier this year to dispose of its coal subsidiary. Without the chemical and coal divisions, `` in essence, it would only be an investment company,'' <PERSON> Hostetter </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, with $ 45 million to $ 55 million in cash, would consider other acquisitions or the possible liquidation of the firm. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>'s stock closed at $ 3.18 -RCB- in over-the-counter trading Thursday, up 6 \ cents from Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sold off the chemical division along with its other assets after the company _ at one point one of the world's leading rubber producers _ went private in a leveraged buyout. <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> had 1988 sales of $ 734.2 million, up from $ 590.5 million last year, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Coors Brings Back Old Label To Appease Disgruntled Beer Drinkers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has learned what happens when you change the label of the flagship beer but do n't change the ingredients: some beer drinkers are convinced it just does n't taste the same. Last summer, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> put a new `` Original Draft'' label on its flagship beer to attract younger drinkers and compete with <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s successful draft beer advertising campaign. But some beer drinkers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ two <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> loyalist strongholds _ thought the retirement of the old `` Banquet Beer'' label meant the beer had changed, although it had n't. Sales fell in some liquor stores and taverns as cans and bottles bearing the old `` Banquet Beer'' label gave way to `` Original Draft.'' `` We thought the change would help us, but it kind of backfired,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> said Thursday. `` We were talking to the brewery to try to tell them how much it was hurting us.'' Coors, battling for a bigger share of the beer market, paid attention. Next week, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, will begin selling the beer under the old `` Banquet Beer'' label again in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ alongside its `` Original Draft'' label. The Coors experience in some ways recalls <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s experiment in April 1985, when it replaced its original cola flavor with a new formulation The ensuing consumer protest forced Coca-Cola to bring back the old flavor three months later, renaming it `` Coca-Cola Classic.'' `` We were faced with a choice _ argue with the customers and say it is the same beer, or give them what they wanted,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> said from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb. Coors introduced the `` Original Draft'' label because <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was having success with an advertising campaign that emphasized its draft beer, <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> wanted consumers to know <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> has been putting draft beer in bottles since 1959. `` We also found that new graphics could attract perhaps a younger drinker, in the 21 to 25 age group,'' he said. The brewery began bottling the beer under the new label last July. This fall, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> officials were surprised to learn they had some disgruntled customers. `` We found there was confusion about whether it was a different beer,'' said <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>. `` We never in our advertising campaign said this is the same beer in a new package. Perhaps that added to the confusion.'' <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> asked the company's 600 beer distributors whether they wanted the old label back. `` The only response was in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. About 20 said they would take Banquet.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> has a loyal following in those areas, said <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>, who thinks the label change was more readily accepted in areas where <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> has not been available so long. The beer has been sold in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since 1937, and in southwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since 1948. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, the label change was especially unpopular with Hispanics over 40, who form the core of El Paso Coors drinkers. <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> said it will not cost the brewery extra to put two kinds of labels on its bottles and cans. `` After running out a few thousand cases, you break about even,'' he said. He thinks that while <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> lost some business with the label change in a few locations, the `` Original Draft'' label already is building a following that could increase sales. And Coors does not plan to change its advertising campaign because of diehard `` Banquet Beer'' label fans. `` Ninety-some-odd percent of our business is Original Draft -LRB- labels -RRB- and will continue to be,'' said <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>.

 In a major blow to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the man appointed to investigate a widening scandal resigned today after saying he had accepted political donations from the company at the center of the controversy. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> today named a political outsider, former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Masami </PERSON> <PERSON> Takatsuji </PERSON>, 78, to replace Justice Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> announced he was stepping down just three days after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> appointed him to a new Cabinet supposedly untainted by a stock-dealing scandal that had already forced the resignation of 17 politicians and business leaders. Opposition parties and analysts say <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> should follow the lead of those leaders and resign. <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s resignation, which occurred the day after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> publicly reaffirmed his support for him, was the second Cabinet casualty. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> stepped down on Dec. 9. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> made no comment on the resignation of <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, 76. <PERSON> Takatsuji </PERSON>, a constitutional expert and former bureaucrat, served as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice from 1973 to 1980. He is an unusual choice as a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member because he is not a career politician, the background of nearly all Cabinet ministers. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> apparently decided it was necessary to go outside politics to find someone without links to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the information conglomerate at the heart of the scandal over charges it sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary to scores of politicians and business leaders at bargain prices. Asked at a news conference today if he had any connection to the Recruit affair, the new justice minister said: `` None at all.'' `` I do n't really have anything to say about Recruit,'' <PERSON> Takatsuji </PERSON> said. `` My attitude toward it is no different from that of the people in general.'' His predecessor had been given a mandate to reform political ethics and head the legal probe of the Recruit scandal. But one day after <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s appointment, it was disclosed that Recruit had given money for 12 years to a group that financed his campaign and political activities. `` There is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donations made from the good will of their supporters,'' <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> told reporters earlier today. `` However, as minister in charge of clearing up the Recruit problem in the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration, which is trying to heighten trust in government, it is regrettable that I received donations from Recruit,'' he said. `` I apologize deeply and resign from my post as justice minister.'' The scandal has engulfed the Liberal Democrats, as several senior party lawmakers or their aides purchased shares in the subsidiary before the shares were offered publicly and later sold them at large tax-free profits. The transactions were legal but have generated a storm of controversy over business and political ethics. Prosecutors also are invesigating possible bribery. Leaders of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>'s resignation was only natural, while the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for the entire Cabinet to resign and new parliamentary elections. `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> should step down because he is connected to the Recruit affair himself and as long as he is appointing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, government wo n't be clean,'' said <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuoka </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Komazawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` There is no way for the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration to regain its public support as more people will probably be arrested as the Recruit investigation advances next year,'' he said. It is widely perceived that the premier should consider resigning when public support dips below 20 percent, <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> said. A newspaper poll this month found <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s public support was 18 percent, down from 30 percent when he took office 13 months ago. An aide to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and one of his relatives also profited in the stock transactions, but the prime minister has denied any personal involvement. `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> can not escape the responsibility of political reform that he has pledged, and he should resign,'' said <PERSON> Jiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamijima </PERSON>, professor of government at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rissho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The entire parliament has been hijacked -LRB- by Recruit -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> confirmed Thursday that his political support organization received $ 46,000 from Recruit over the last 12 years, but <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> said he had no knowledge of the donations. Other new Cabinet members have received donations from Recruit, including the agriculture and economic planning agency chiefs and Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, who has acknowledged his political support group received monthly donations of $ 160 from Recruit.

<TEXT>
 The government's chief gauge of future economic activity edged down 0.2 percent in November, after having risen in the previous month, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. The performance by the department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators continued a sawtooth pattern which analysts said was signaling that economic growth will slow in the new year, but the country should not topple into a recession. The index had risen 0.4 percent in October after having suffered a 0.3 percent decline in September. Since May, the index has exhibited an alternating pattern of increases and declines in each month. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen 1.6 percent, less than half the 4.1 percent increase of the previous 12-month period. To many analysts this suggests that economic growth will be slower in 1989 but there should be no recession. The traditional signal of an economic downturn is three consecutive months of declines in the leading index. While the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, is expected to climb by 3.9 percent this year, the best performance in four years, many analysts are predicting growth in the new year will slow to around 2.5 percent. Such a slowdown would have the beneficial effect of easing inflationary fears, analysts said. With many industries already operating at close to peak capacity and with unemployment near 14-year lows, economists believe that slower growth is needed to keep the economy from overheating. `` We think a little slowdown is useful right now,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The economy has been growing too fast and needs to slow to a more sustainable pace.'' In November, four of the available nine indicators contributed to the decline. The biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery times on business orders. This is viewed negatively for the future because it indicates declining demand for products. The other negative factors dragging the index down were a fall in stock prices, an increase in weekly unemployment claims and a decline in raw materials prices, also viewed as a negative because it signals falling demand. Three indicators made positive contributions, led by an increase in growth in the money supply. Other positive forces were a rise in manufacturing orders for consumer goods and an increase in orders for new plants and equipment. Two indicators, building permits and the length of the average workweek, were unchanged in November. The various changes left the index at 193.2 percent of its 1967 base of 100. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been tightening up on credit for much of this year in a move to dampen demand and keep inflation from accelerating. Even without the credit tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, many analysts said a slowdown would have occurred anyway because they expect that business investment and export sales, the two sources of strength in 1988, can not continue growing at the same rates in 1989. Those two sectors of the economy were responsible for half of all growth in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said it was projecting a somewhat slower demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactured goods in its annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Industrial Outlook, based on the expectation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and capital spending will not rise at the same breakneck pace in the new year. The outlook forecast that 70 percent of all manufacturing companies would enjoy rising sales in the new year, down from a decade-high level of 82 percent in 1988.

<HEAD>Government Will Inject $2 Billion into Troubled Automaker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government has decided to proceed with a $ 2 billion capital injection for <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>, the state-owned automaker, the <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. The widely expected announcement was the latest development in a dispute between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s plans to make <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> solvent by easing its debt burden. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive commission wants <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> operated as a normal company rather than a government authority. The French agree but want to make sure they can continue to finance the company. In an apparent effort to placate the commission, the <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> published a decree Friday saying <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> would be run in accordance with Article 241 of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 1966 corporate legal code. The decree gives government decisions the same status as a vote by a general shareholders meeting, since the state is the group's only shareholder This, in turn, means that a capital boost approved by the state has the same legal status as one approved by shareholders of a private-sector company. <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 5 billion between 1981 and 1986, and by the end of 1987 its liabilities amounted to $ 7.7 billion, almost $ 2 billion more than its assets.

 Stock prices moved higher in quiet dealings early today, as the market's best-known index made a bid to finish the year at its highest level since the October 1987 market crash. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has risen 20 points over the past two sessions, was up 4.28 at 2,186.96 after 30 minutes of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average's highest close for 1988 is 2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21, also the highest close since the October 1987 crash. Advancing issues took the lead over losers by a margin of 5 to 4 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 507 up, 433 down and 586 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 20.02 million shares at 10 a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 19.95 million shares at the same point on Thursday. As the market headed into its final trading session of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was about 12.6 percent above its 1987 close. Trading was expected to be relatively light today as many investors take an early leave for the New Year holiday weekend. Market watchers said the light volume could exaggerate the price swings and that last-minute efforts to adjust end-of-year investment portfolios could distort the day's activity. In economic news today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its Index of Leading Indicators fell 0.2 percent in November. But the government also revised upward its estimate of the October gain in the leading indicators to a 0.4 percent rise rather than the 0.1 percent increase originally reported. Among the early actively-traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SCE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 32 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 35 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 17 -RRB- Quantum Chemical was down -RCB- at 106 -LCB- after gaining more than 18 over the past two sessions in the wake of its announcement of a recapitalization plan. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.13 at 157.03. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was off 0.40 at 303.29. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose 16.25 to 2,182.68. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 987 up, 477 down and 524 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 131.29 million shares, up from 110.63 million in Wednesday's session.

<HEAD>Judge Restrains Takeover Effort, Cites Drexel Case As One Reason</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge's decision stalling a $ 970 million takeover effort is based on concerns about the deal's huge debt financing and criminal sanctions hanging over its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The order by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> late Thursday came hours before <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 20-a-share bid for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was due to expire. MAI Basic extended the bid until Jan. 11. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON>'s ruling appeared to be the first time that concern over <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s record settlement of securities fraud charges announced last week had affected litigation in a hostile takeover fight. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said he wanted more information from <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based MAI Basic, which is about one fourth the size of Prime, involving `` the ambitious, fragile and possibly illegal financial requirements through which -LRB- it and other investors -RRB- propose to acquire Prime.'' The judge said MAI Basic, controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, and its investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, are proposing a deal that will cost a total of $ 1.5 billion with `` virtually all of this financing -LRB- taking -RRB- the form of debt.'' Of the $ 1.5 billion, $ 875 million would be in the form of junk bond financing from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> noted has `` acknowledged its guilt to six felony counts related to its involvement in similarly heavily leveraged transactions.'' `` Suggestions that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s guilty plea improves its financial stability, while not necessarily disingenuous, are not helpful,'' <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said. Prime stock closed at $ 17.75, up 37.5 cents, in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Eluck </PERSON>, an attorney for MAI Basic, said he was optimistic MAI Basic would address some of <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON>'s concerns about financial disclosures and that MAI Basic would be able to satisfy his latest concerns. The judge also said MAI Basic's offer requires the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts to strike down Prime's `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan or for Prime's board to rescind it, which is unlikely. Prime is headquartered in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> but incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` The bidders acknowledge that the poison pill makes Prime prohibitively expensive,'' <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said. `` Yet, despite a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decision refusing to enjoin the plan, the bidders continue to assert with confidence that they can consummate the deal.'' <PERSON> Eluck </PERSON> said MAI Basic intended to pursue efforts in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts aimed at overturning Prime's poison pill. Under the plan, if a party acquires more than 20 percent of Prime, current shareholders are entitled to buy shares at half price. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Eluck </PERSON> said MAI Basic would respond promptly to <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON>'s latest queries for further details of the financing. `` We think we will be able to provide them and comply with the judge's directions for further disclosures by the end of next week,'' he said. Prime said in a statement: `` We are gratified by the district court's order and its recognition of the serious economic and legal questions raised by MAI's efforts to acquire Prime.''

<HEAD>Domestic Carmakers Narrow Quality Gap, Marketing Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domestic carmakers should be able to close the quality gap with their Japanese and European rivals in the next five years, auto marketing expert <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says. `` Domestic -LRB- manufacturers -RRB- as a group are still five years behind the Japanese, but we're projecting by'93 or'94 we'll have parity in product quality, at least in consumer perceptions,'' Power, founder of J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, told auto dealers at the Indianapolis Auto Show. Power predicted slightly slowing car sales over the next two years, followed by a brisk recovery. `` We're -LRB- projecting -RRB- an average of 10.3 million passenger cars and 4.9 million trucks'' will be sold in each of the next two years, he said Thursday. `` We see -LRB- sales -RRB- climbing back by'93 to about 11 million passenger cars and 4.8 million light-duty trucks.'' He said he does not expect continuing growth in demand for light-duty trucks, which have given domestic manufacturers a big lift in recent years. `` One thing that concerns me about the truck business is the rosy projections everyone is giving to it,'' <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. `` I would caution the industry ... to be looking at a realistic level of sales. We can not sustain a 5 million light-duty truck market forever.''

 Stock prices turned mostly lower in quiet dealings today, as the market's best-known index drifted just below its highest closing level since the October 1987 market crash. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has risen 20 points over the past two sessions, was down 1.79 at 2,180.89 after 90 minutes of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average's highest close for 1988 is 2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21, also the highest close since the October 1987 crash.

 Soybean futures prices opened moderately higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in sympathy with a rally in the soybean meal market, but grain futures were nearly unchanged. Volume was light and trading conditions were extremely thin with many traders getting an early start on the long New Year's weekend. The exchange was scheduled to close at noon CST and to reopen on Tuesday. Analysts attributed gains in the soy complex to the lighter-than-expected delivery notices posted today against the soon-to-expire January soy contracts _ a sign of strong demand. But grain traders seemed more concerned about evening up their positions before the end of the year. `` It's not going to be a real exciting day, to say the least,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with the G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Federal regulators announced the closings of two more insolvent savings and loan associations today, pushing the total for the year to 199 with officials predicting that figure would climb to a post-Depression record well above 200 before the year-end rush to complete deals is over. The latest sales, involving insolvent S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, were announced at mid-day as the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> continued to meet behind closed doors reviewing applications to take over failed institutions. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> scheduled a late afternoon press conference to announce further agreements and to answer charges raised by critics that many of the multimillion-dollar bailouts represented bad deals for the government. Critics have complained that in its rush to complete sales before midnight Saturday, when tax breaks for buyers will be cut in half, the bank board failed to drive the best bargains possible. The latest acquisitions involved the sale of the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The agreement was te first acquisition under the bank board's <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION>, providing for accelerated review of cases in that state. The government pledged assistance of $ 89 million and <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> agreed to invest $ 16 million in cash. In the other deal, the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, was taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missoula </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The agreement, in which the government pledged $ 11.4 million in assistance, resolved the final insolvent S & amp; L in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The 199 insolvent S & amp; Ls which have been closed compared to 48 closed in 1987 and would be the highest figure since 277 S & amp; Ls failed in 1938, during the Depression. The bank board for the first time has drawn foreign investors into its effort to bail out sick S & amp; Ls in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. It announced a subsidiary of a Taiwanese company had agreed to buy eight insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings institutions. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> defended the sale of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts to Taiwanese investors, saying, `` We welcome our first non-U.S. owned investor ... Their interest in investing in the future of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is a further indication of the attractiveness of the state's thrift industry as well as its business climate.'' Working against a midnight Saturday deadline, the bank board announced the sale of 13 more insolvent S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> late Thursday. All of the institutions will be open for business as usual today, sporting new names and with their depositors' funds fully protected. Even with the year-end rush of closings, there are still more than 400 insolvent S & amp; Ls operating, and estimates of cleaning up the total mess range as high as $ 112 billion. The amount of money needed presents an immediate problem for the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is faced with the task of coming up with a solution to the S & amp; L crisis that will not make it impossible for him to meet his campaign pledge of narrowing the federal budget deficit without resorting to higher taxes. Many congressional critics believe that the bank board's efforts are going in the wrong direction and will worsen not narrow the ultimate cost to the government. Wall has insisted that the cost of simply closing the institutions and paying off depositors would far exceed the sales which are being arranged through the use of tax breaks and direct federal assistance as a lure to buyers. The tax benefits to S & amp; L buyers will be effectively cut in half after midnight Saturday. The provisions that will expire allow firms purchasing failed S & amp; Ls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from profits the firms earned on other operations. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to hold a series of hearings starting in January on the deals, looking specifically at the two largest bailouts announced this week. Those complex transactions will cost the government $ 6.8 billion in assistance to the purchasers of American Savings of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and the acquisition of five deeply troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> S & amp; Ls by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> cosmetics chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>. The S & amp; Ls which were closed on Thursday included one institution in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and 12 insolvent S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> which were purchased by two separate groups of investors, including the first sale of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions to foreigners. The details of the transactions were: _ Eight insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which agreed to invest $ 37.5 million The branches will be operated under the name <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F.S.B. </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. The bank board agreed to provide $ 566.2 million in government assistance to the purchasers. The S & amp; Ls being taken over were Charter Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Lampasas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bayview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Luling </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Gonzales </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Yoakum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yoakum </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Sequin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sequin </ORGANIZATION>. _ Four insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts were purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Centex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> home builder, who will operate the former branches as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> F.S.B In that transaction, the bank board will provide $ 429 million in government assistance and <ORGANIZATION> Centex </ORGANIZATION> will invest $ 26.5 million.

 The interest rate forecast for 1988 turned out to be a bit like a long-range weather report, with few experts accurately predicting what was in store for the borrowing public. `` Everyone was thrown for a loop,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, a principal of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was a year that frustrated many.'' Consumers and businesses generally saw short-term interest rates soar while longer-term rates were little changed from the previous year, a mixed blessing for both groups. As a result, the so-called yield curve, which illustrates the difference between short - and long rates in the bond market, took an unusual turn in 1988 First it flattened from the normal upward slope, then started to invert for the first time in about six years. `` I think if you were to try to isolate one key factor of the 1988 fixed-income environment it was the pronounced flattening of the yield curve,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money-market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. On the last day of trading in 1988, for instance, the yield on the one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill was slightly higher than that of the bellwether 30-year bond, 9.00 percent vs. 8.98 percent The 3-month-bill yield was still 0.64 percentage points lower than the long bond, although normally the gap is around 2 percentage points. Long-term rates usually are significantly higher to compensate investors for their increased risk. -LRB- For instance, it's more likely that someone will renege on a 30-year debt than on one lasting three months. -RRB- The last time the yield curve inverted, the stock market took a tumble and the nation headed into a recession. Few economists, though, are predicting a similar scenario for 1989. In fact, it was fears of the opposite occurring that pushed short-term rates as high as they are now. `` The short-end rise -LRB- in rates -RRB- came from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. At the start of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> eased its credit policies by keeping interest rates down, out of near-universal concern the country was close to a recession from the previous October's stock market crash. But the economy showed surprising resilience. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> then started to worry about rising inflation, along with an unstable dollar in foreign exchange, and switched gears by tightening credit. Inflation actually remained in check throughout the year, which is partly why long-term interest rates and prices remained fairly stable, economists said. The central bank took its biggest inflation-fighting stand in August, when it raised the discount rate, the interest charged on loans to member banks, a half percentage point to 6.5 percent. Other indirect movements have been made known since. Commercial lending rates followed suit. Major banks lowered their prime lending rates _ used to set rates on most corporate and consumer loans _ a quarter of a percentage point to 8.5 percent on Feb. 2, then raised them a half percentage point four times to 10.5 percent by year's end. There was a similar pattern for mortgage rates. For a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, rates ranged from a low of 9.84 percent in mid-February to a high of 10.77 percent at year's end, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The interest rate climate did n't have too much effect on the volume of municipal and corporate issues. For the year, the volume of municipal issues totaled around $ 112 billion, compared with $ 101.5 billion in 1987. The volume of corporate issues rose to around $ 275 billion from $ 272.19 billion. Many economists predict that rates will continue to rise during the first half of 1989, with the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond yielding as much as 9.5 percent. It was as low as 8.29 percent in February and as high as 9.45 in August. During the second half, interest rates should decline as the economy starts to cool down, economists predict. `` We expect <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy next year to be driven primarily by inflation and inflation expectations,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market was narrowly mixed this afternoon as blue-chip issues turned lower in the last trading session of the year. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 20 points over the past two sessions, was down 7.68 at 2,175.00 with one hour to go. Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average had traded above its highest closing level for 1988 which was 2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21 and the highest close since the October 1987 market crash. But the blue-chip index faded as the afternoon session wore on. Advancing issues held a tiny lead over decliners among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 738 up, 715 down and 530 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 97.99 million shares at 3 p.m. on Wall Street, compared with 109.82 million shares at the same point on Thursday. As the market headed into its final trading session of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was about 12.6 percent above its 1987 close. Trading was relatively light as many investors left early to begin the New Year holiday weekend. Market watchers said the light volume could exaggerate the price swings and that last-minute efforts to adjust end-of-year investment portfolios could distort the day's activity. In economic news today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its Index of Leading Indicators fell 0.2 percent in November. But the government also revised upward its estimate of the October gain in the leading indicators to a 0.4 percent rise rather than the 0.1 percent increase originally reported. Among the actively-traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, Quantum Chemicals was off 1 -LCB- at 105 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 35 \, <ORGANIZATION> SCE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 32 -RRB- and Bankers Trust <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was off -LRB- at 35 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 1 \ to 6 -RCB- after reporting lower earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was off 0.39 at 156.51.

 The dollar ended the year weaker against most major currencies in thin, abbreviated trading Friday. Gold prices recovered. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 410.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up $ 1.60 from late Thursday, when it lost $ 5.10 an ounce. Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's weaker tone Friday largely to comments made by <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> in an interview with West German newspaper Die Welt. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said a further increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates could cause the dollar to rise, making it more difficult for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce its high trade deficit. One dealer said the comments had an impact on the market because they were intperpreted as a call by <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> for a lower dollar and a firmer mark. However, others said that since trading was thin on the last business day of 1988 some transactions had an exaggerated effect on rates. Trading also ended a few hours earlier than usual. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.13 yen to close the year at 125.90 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.10 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar stood at 124.95 yen, down from 125.625. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8062, compared with $ 1.7900 Thursday. Sterling fetched $ 1.8115 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.7905. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.7770 West German marks, down from 1.7875; 1.4995 Swiss francs, down from 1.5140; 1.19245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19205; 6.0480 French francs, down from 6.0965; and 1,306.00 Italian lire, down from 1,315.00. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.7725 West German marks, down from 1.7875; 1.5025 Swiss francs, down from 1.5125; 6.0600 French francs, down from 6.0975; 2.0020 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0190; 1,305.25 Italian lire, down from 1,314.50; and 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19225. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery closed at $ 410.00 a troy ounce, up from $ 408.20 late Thursday.

 The stock market turned in a mixed performance today as blue-chip issues sank, failing to sustain a run at a post-crash closing high and fading as the last session of the year drew to an end. Nonetheless, the market managed to post some sizeable gains for the year. Analysts cited profit-taking in advance of the three-day New Years holiday weekend, program selling by professional traders, a rise in oil prices and weakness in the dollar for the stock market's performance in the final session of 1988 `` It's the end of the year, and the last opportunity to sell,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a market technician for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> also pointed out that the market had recovered more ground than many people would have expected at the time of the October 1987 market crash. `` So it ai n't all bad,'' he said.

<HEAD>Yearlong Takeover Battle Ends With Formal Approval Of Bank Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 One of the nation's longest and most bitter takeover battles formally ended Friday _ the last business day of the year _ with the $ 1.48 billion merger of <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The merger was approved by <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s shareholders at a special meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said it expected that the principal banking subsidiaries of the two holding companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will be merged in the first half of 1989. `` All our efforts will now be directed to forging both institutions into a major force in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and worldwide banking,'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON>, chairman of the merged company, said in a statement. The two banks ended a year-long feud Oct. 7, when <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors voted to end its resistance and drop all lawsuits and anti-takeover measures. In return, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its offer by about $ 200 million by slightly increasing the stock portion of its bid and adding stock warrants. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> removed the last formal obstacle to the merger Nov. 28 by approving the deal. The board originally gave conditional approval in February, extending it four times as <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> battled the takeover. The merger will nearly double <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s size, vaulting it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies. The two banks had a combined $ 47.8 billion in assets as of June 30. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, launched Sept. 25, 1987, was the first hostile takeover attempt among American banks.

<HEAD>Soybeans End Year With A Surge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices surged to a 10-week high Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts of drier weather in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean belt and rumors of more soybean meal purchases by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On other markets, energy futures rose sharply; precious metals were higher; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. Volume was uniformly light in thin trading conditions with many traders away for the holidays. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures markets closed at noon local time and will not reopen until Tuesday morning. Soybeans settled 7 \ cents to 17 cents higher with the contract for delivery in January at $ 8.04 -RCB- a bushel, marking the first settlement above $ 8 for a near-month soybean contract since Oct. 19 Some meteorologists said a high-pressure ridge was forming over the central section of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which could cause a return to the unusually warm, dry conditions that marked the recent soybean planting period in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Additional buying was prompted by rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> planned to buy more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A Soviet purchase of at least 600,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal earlier this week surprised traders and boosted optimism about export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains. `` The Soviets are on a very aggressive import program for both grain and protein in an attempt to improve food supply and availabilities,'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Grain futures also closed higher. The wheat market was supported by a new 90-day forecast for continued dry weather in the <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, where winter wheat is grown, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Corn was buoyed by spillover buying from the adjacent wheat and soybean pits, he said. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 \ cents higher with March at $ 4.40 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.84 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.43 -RCB- a Crude oil for February delivery steamed through psychological resistance at $ 17 a barrel and soared all the way to $ 17.30 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> before late profit-taking cut the gains. `` When it got past $ 17.15, a cold sweat gripped the shorts -LRB- players who had bet that prices would fall -RRB- and they started to buy,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It was a real buying frenzy in there.'' The rally was almost entirely due to chart signals rather than supply-and-demand factors, he said. But with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new oil-production restraints scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, few players were willing to go home holding short positions, he said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 47 cents higher with February at $ 17.24 a barrel; heating oil settled .50 cent to .84 cent higher with January at 53.48 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .77 cent to 1.05 cents higher with January at 47.88 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures rose modestly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange in a technical rebound after declining in each of the three previous sessions. Platinum futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but analysts were not encouraged by the rise in prices. `` Going into the new year, I've got to say the trend is a bit down,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a vice president of precious metals and foreign exchange trading with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1.80 higher across the board with February at $ 412.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 4 cents higher with March at $ 6.13 a troy ounce; platinum was 80 cents to $ 2.30 higher with January at $ 516.60 a troy ounce. Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in thin, directionless holiday trading. Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 73.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .07 cent higher with January at 84.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .03 cent higher with February at 46.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .55 cent higher with February at 43.05 cents a pound. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.70 points lower at 280.40. Each point is worth $ 500.

 Bond prices rose slightly in thin, pre-holiday trading Friday, leaving the yield on the widely watched long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issue unchanged compared with its level a year ago. The bellwether 30-year bond ended the year up around -LRB- point, or $ 1.25 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is often seen as a signal of interest rate trends, fell to 8.98 percent from 9.00 percent late Thursday. The 30-year bond's yield ended 1987 at 8.98 percent as well The market was described as extremely quiet, with trading ending earlier than usual in advance of the New Year's Day holiday. Analysts said there were little price movements and the market virtually ignored government reports showing a 0.2 percent drop in November leading indicators and an 8 percent decline in November single family home sales. In the secondary market for outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and notes, prices of short-term governments rose between 1-32 point and 5-32 point, intermediate maturities rose around 5-16 point and long-term issues ranged from 1-32 point lower to \ point higher, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business-information service. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was up 1.36 at 1,233.05. The index finished 1987 at 1,154.88. In corporate trading prices also strengthened marginally. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.13 to 293.95, putting it substantially ahead of its closing 1987 level of 268.41 Meanwhile, yields on outstanding three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills dropped to 8.36 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to 8.09 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.61 percent as the discount declined 5 basis points to 8.17 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 9.00 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 8.34 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the ace value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 8 -RCB- percent, down from 9 -LCB- percent late Thursday. The higher rate on Thursday reflected yearend demand for extra capital reserves.

<HEAD>Small Investors' Portfolios Gained 10 Percent In 1988, Magazine
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite predictions of gloom following the stock market crash of October 1987, Money magazine's small investor index recorded a 10 percent gain in 1988, the magazine says. The gain raised the value of the typical household's portfolio from $ 70,956 to $ 78,019, the magazine said. The magazine's index is based on figures on individual investment supplied by many sources, including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, various investment houses and newsletters that follow the investment field. Its household figure is derived by dividing the total amount of individual investment by the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sivy </PERSON>, a Money senior editor. The biggest winners of the year were stocks, especially blue-chip issues, which racked up gains of 17.9 percent in the index, the magazine said. Municipal bonds recorded an 11.4 percent gain for the year, it said. Low short-term rates at the beginning of 1988 made money-market funds and certificates of deposit poor performers, returning 6 percent and 8 percent for the year respectively, it said. Gold was the year's big loser, down in value 26.6 percent, it said. But the metal represents less than 1 percent of individuals' overall investments, it added

 Blue-chip issues stumbled Friday in their bid to finish 1988 at the highest levels since the October 1987 crash, fading steadily in the afternoon as the overall market posted a mixed finale to a year in which many indicators posted double-digit gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 20 points in the previous two sessions to within a point of its highest closing level since the market crash more than 14 months ago, lost 14.11 points to close at 2,168.57. That left the market's best-known barometer with a decline of 0.36 for the week, but with a gain of 229.74 points, or 11.85 percent, for the year. It was also the first year that the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average has finished above the 2,000 mark. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 945 up, 594 down and 466 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 127.21 million shares, down from 131.29 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 160.65 million shares. As the session got underway, the Dow Jones industrials moved above the year's closing peak of 2,183.50 set on Oct. 21. But the index turned lower by midmorning, holding at a slightly lower level until midafternoon when it began a steady erosion toward the close. Analysts cited profit-taking in advance of the three-day New Years holiday weekend, program selling by professional traders, a rise in oil prices and weakness in the dollar for the stock market's performance `` It's the end of the year, and the last opportunity to sell,'' said ack <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a market technician for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> also pointed out that the market had recovered more ground than many people would have expected at the time of the October 1987 market crash. `` All in all, how bad was 1988? It was an up year and if you scratched anybody during the year, they would have said it was going down,'' he said. The market appeared to shrug off a pair of reports that indicated a slowing economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its Index of Leading Indicators fell 0.2 percent in November, but also revised upward its estimate of the October gain in the leading indicators to a 0.4 percent rise rather than the 0.1 percent increase originally reported. In a separate report, it said sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in November, the largest setback in 18 months. Quantum Chemicals was the most actively-traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, falling 1 ~ to 105 -RRB- The company's stock climbed 18 -RCB- in the previous two sessions after announcing a recpaitalization plan that included a special dividend. <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION> was the second most active issue and was the biggest percentage loser as it fell 1 \ to 6 -RCB- The company announced lower earnings from operations for its fourth fiscal quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 12 \ as takeover rumors circulated The automobile stocks fell. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> was fell 1 -RCB- to 83 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> lost 1 to 50 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> fell -RCB- to 25 -RCB-. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market fell $ 7.144 billion, or 0.26 percent, in value. For the year, the <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> index rose $ 318 billion, or 13.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.64 to 156.26 but finished the week with a 0.20 gain and was up 13 percent from 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 2.12 to 321.26, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index lost 1.68 to 277.72 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 2.33 to 381.38.

<TEXT>
 Poultry giant <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> won an important round Friday in its fight to acquire rival <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.1 billion when a judge blocked the target company from merging with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling by a Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> is incorporated, evidently means <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION> can proceed with its unsolicited $ 54-a-share cash tender offer for the company. `` It's a major victory,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, counsel for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. `` We are pleased and gratified with the court's decision.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> is the nation's biggest poultry producer, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> is No. 2 and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> is No. 5. Together they control about 30 percent of the ready-to-cook poultry market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, has been resisting <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s overtures and sought a merger with Omaha-based <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> to thwart an unfriendly takeover Under that deal, arranged in November, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> would acquire <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> in a stock swap valued by securities analysts at about $ 995 million. <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> had been asked by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> to set aside <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>' deal with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> contended the target company's directors had not considered getting the best price for their stockholders. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> also contended that the Holly's board was influenced by managers who are unfriendly to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s. Industry analysts have said a <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> takeover of <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> would likely lead to management changes at <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION>, while a merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> probably would not cause such turnover. `` Apparently, we won the case,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>. `` We are now going to actively pursue the acquisition. It means the playing field has been made into an even ground.'' Officials for <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> were in meetings and were n't immediately available for comment Earlier Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> extended its tender offer until Jan. 6. Nearly 3 million of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 20 million shares outstanding had been tendered, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> produces more than 2 billion pounds of poultry a year, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> turns out about 1.5 billion pounds, and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> processes about 1.2 billion pounds. The court announcement came after the conclusion of nationwide stock trading. Holly stock closed Friday at $ 55.62 -LCB- per share, up 37 -LCB- cents. Tyson closed at $ 17.25, up 37 -LCB- cents. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> closed down 12 -LCB- cents, at $ 29.

<HEAD>Zenith Asks U.S. To Monitor TV Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> asked the government Friday to invoke a never-used law to monitor imports of televisions made by companies suspected of `` dumping'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sets they assembled outside their home countries. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the only remaining U.S.-owned TV maker, said monitoring by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would discourage foreign TV makers from evading penalties imposed for selling their products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at unfairly low prices. The request stems from a provision in the 1984 trade law that permits the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop a 12-month monitoring program in certain cases. `` We're simply asking the government to enforce the laws on the books,'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that before going ahead with a monitoring program, the agency would have to find an `` extraordinary pattern of persistent, injurious dumping'' that was causing a serious problem for the domestic industry. She said the department also would have to decide how to monitor imports _ a procedure presumably less complex than a full-scale dumping investigation. `` Because it's a statute that's never been applied, it's something we'll have to look at to determine what is the best way,'' Ms. <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON> said Dumping refers to the sale of products in foreign markets at unfairly low prices to get rid of excess production or to force competitors out of business. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, has not had an annual profit since 1984, largely because of fierce competition from cheap imports. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s 378-page request asks the government to monitor imports of color TVs, picture tubes and parts from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Those countries have assembly plants established by television manufacturers based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> claims that by assembling television sets in other countries for export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the large Asian television makers are evading anti-dumping duties imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that raise the prices of Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese-made sets at their borders. `` Even though a television produced at a <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> plant may have a Japanese picture tube and Japanese chassis and essentially is a Japanese TV set, it's imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without any anti-dumping duties assessed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Anti-dumping provisions for picture tubes also are in place against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Ordinarily, a dumping investigation is initiated when a company or industry petitions the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ a cumbersome and costly process. But the 1974 trade law also contains a provision for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to initiate its own investigation if it determines through monitoring that dumping is taking place. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will `` self-initiate'' an investigation in the latest case.

<TEXT>
 A state appeals court upheld a jury verdict awarding an investor group 20 percent of the stock of the computer franchise giant <ORGANIZATION> ComputerLand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a case that started with a $ 250,000 loan. The ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, issued late Thursday, included harsh words for the management as well as the legal arguments of <ORGANIZATION> ComputerLand </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>, who has been driven from control of the Oakland-based company. <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> `` was continuously engaged in a kind of shell game -LRB- with his corporations -RRB- whereby one would be informally merged with another,'' Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said in the 3-0 decision. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> kept `` chaotic -LRB- and frequently non-existent -RRB- corporate records'' and offered `` speciously legalistic'' arguments in the appeal that contradicted his claims at trial. The court upheld a jury's findings that the terms of a $ 250,000 loan to <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> more than 12 years ago, in the early stages of his venture, included the right to exchange the note for 20 percent of the stock in <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>'s computer business. The note was later bought by a group of investors called <ORGANIZATION> MicroVest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which sued <ORGANIZATION> ComputerLand </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> refused to transfer the stock in 1981. In addition to the stock, an <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury awarded MicroVest $ 141 million, mostly in punitive damages. The damages were dropped in December 1985 in a partial settlement which included <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>'s resignation from the board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> MicroVest </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> on Friday confirmed reports that the settlement gave the investment group an additional 8.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> ComputerLand </ORGANIZATION> stock, bringing the total to 28.5 percent. He said he expects the company to make a public stock offering this spring and estimated the total value of <ORGANIZATION> ComputerLand </ORGANIZATION> at $ 500 million. The ruling is `` the long-overdue culmination of an unnecessary legal battle,'' <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Computerland </ORGANIZATION> `` is now prospering after some tough times,'' with new management and continued operation of a chain of 500 computer stores. <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufstedler </PERSON>, declined comment on the ruling, saying she had not seen it. In appealing the jury verdict, <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> argued that the stock-conversion feature of the original $ 250,000 loan applied only to his original computer company, called <ORGANIZATION> IMS </ORGANIZATION>, which allegedly went out of existence after a merger. He also said he had agreed orally with one of the original lenders that the note and stock option would not be transferred to anyone without <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>'s consent. The appeals court said <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> did not make those arguments during the trial, and also said the evidence was to the contrary. Not only did <ORGANIZATION> IMS </ORGANIZATION> evidently remain in existence, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said, but the loan applied to any of <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>'s computer businesses, including the later-formed <ORGANIZATION> ComputerLand </ORGANIZATION>. He also said the written loan agreement, presumably the best evidence of the parties' intentions, made no reference to any restrictions on transfers, and indicated the loan could be assigned. The court also rejected <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>'s argument that MicroVest should be denied any reward because it was allegedly a `` sham corporation'' formed for the purposes of prosecuting a lawsuit. `` The individuals who paid to be a part of Micro @ Vest were investing in the anticipated ownership of the various corporations in which they believed the conversion option gave <ORGANIZATION> MicroVest </ORGANIZATION> a 20 percent ownership interest,'' <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said. `` This is not the same thing as selling shares in litigation.''

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Portend Economic Slowdown; Home Sales Skid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge edged down 0.2 percent in November, continuing a see-saw pattern that analysts said portends a slowdown but no recession in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Friday on its Index of Leading Economic Indicators was viewed as good news by some experts, who said it should ease fears that the economy was growing at a pace that threatened new inflation. The 0.2 percent November decline was the fourth drop in the past seven months. Since May, the index has alternated between gains and declines, showing very little forward momentum and suggesting overall economic growth will slow significantly in 1989. In another signal of slower growth, the government reported Friday that sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in November, the biggest decline in 18 months. Analysts blamed the setback on rising mortgage rates likely to further dampen sales in 1989. The last government numbers of 1988 had little or no influence over the financial markets, which closed out the final trading day of the year with mixed results in light trading. Bond prices rose slightly, the dollar weakened marginally against key currencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 14.11 points to close at 2,168.57, though advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the setback in the leading index was nothing to become alarmed over, showing only that the economy was slowing a bit. The traditional signal for a recession in the past has been at least three consecutive monthly declines in the index. Private analysts agreed, forecasting that overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, will probably dip to around 2.5 percent in 1989. That would be down from an expected growth rate of 3.9 percent in 1988, the economy's best performance in four years.
