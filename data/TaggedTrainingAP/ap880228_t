 A senior commander ordered his officers Sunday to view film footage of troops brutally beating Arab prisoners and said the Israeli army must not become `` a rabble army.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, head of the Central Command that is in charge of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, gathered all officers over the rank of platoon commander Sunday and showed them the footage shot by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. `` I'm against those who think we can sweep internal problems under the carpet just because they're not pretty,'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said earlier on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We have to make sure we do n't become a rabble army.'' The film, which showed four soldiers in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> kicking and beating two Palestinians last Thursday, shocked many Israelis who believed violence by soldiers during three months of Palestinian demonstrations had receded after new army orders last week limited the use of force. Some members of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> defended the soldiers. `` I'm against the lynch atmosphere,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. `` There was no need to arrest the soldiers.'' Transport Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Korfu </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, told the Cabinet Sunday the press should be barred from the occupied lands for three months. `` We are in a confrontation,'' <PERSON> Korfu </PERSON> later told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must take these minimal measures when we know for certain -LRB- the media -RRB- is responsible for some of the violence.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 74 Arabs have been killed by the Israelis during the violent in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since Dec. 10. Hundreds have been wounded and there have been many cases of soldiers severely beating Palestinians. The CBS film showed four soldiers, members of a tank unit, kicking the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> whose hands were tied behind their backs and smashing them on the legs and arms with fist-sized rocks. The four were arrested and their deputy unit commander, a captain, was suspended. It was announced Saturday that the four soldiers would be tried by a military court. <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> ordered the release of the two Arabs. <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpaz </PERSON>, the mother of one of the four soldiers filmed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, said her son <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> had changed since he began serving in the occupied territories 10 weeks ago. `` I educated my son to go the army, take responsibility and defend the country,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` What has happened is that he has turned into a beater of women and children.'' She is a resident of <ORGANIZATION> Kibbutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gesher </ORGANIZATION>, a communal settlement. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said several lawyers have offered to represent the soldiers without charge. It reported the lawyers said if anyone was responsible for a crime, it is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders.

 A salvage crew raised a sunken oil barge Sunday from the murky depths of <LOCATION> Guemes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, one month after it sank and spilled some 70,000 gallons of heavy bunker oil into <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inland waters. With the inverted barge held at the surface by thick cables strung from two giant cranes, crews began pumping the more than 300,000 gallons of oil that remained in the vessel into a second barge. Officials said they wanted to get the stricken barge floating on its own before they attempted to slowly roll it right side up. A helicopter hovered overhead to track the movement of an oil sheen that appeared as the barge was raised. The sheen was caused by 500 to 1,000 gallons of lighter oil that was detected after the barge broke the surface about 7 a.m., said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the state Division of Emergency Management. The barge initially held about 22,000 gallons of light oil in addition to the heavy oil. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said surface skimmer boats had cleaned up about 160 gallons, while absorbent pads collected an additional, undetermined amount. The oil sheen moved about two miles south. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Eldo </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said the sheen reached some kelp beds near <LOCATION> Burrows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but did not touch any beaches. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> workers said three seabirds were contaminated, but they did not appear badly injured and were not captured for cleaning. Marine biologists and state environmental experts were assessing the damage from the bunker oil spill, which had been difficult to determine because the heavier-than-water oil had sunk. But <PERSON> Ats </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiuchi </PERSON>, a DOE spokesman, said it appeared the fragile, inner coastal environment had avoided a disaster that, if the barge had spilled its entire cargo, would have been the worst oil spill in the state's history. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> has found some oil in sea cucumbers, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, the lab's director of operations The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tug `` Spike'' used absorbent pads to clean up some oil after the barge was raised while a second boat was positioned near <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, 100 yards away, to prevent any oil from reaching shore. The 176-foot-long barge, operated by Olympic Tug and Barge of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, sank Jan. 31 in about 130 feet of water four miles west of <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION> and about 100 yards off <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Point </PERSON>. The barge had been loaded at an oil refinery at <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION> and was being towed by a tug to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> when it began listing and capsized. The cause of the sinking remained undetermined. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Eldo </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said the barge will be taken to the <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION> city dock where a boom would be put around it and any remaining holes would be patched. Eventually it will be taken to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, he said.

 A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper said Sunday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent a secret envoy to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to discuss re-establishing diplomatic links. The Observer, in an unattributed story, did not identify the official but said he is apparently a close friend of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and went to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> two weeks ago. It said the envoy was traveling under the name of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The Observer said the envoy met middle-ranking Iranian officials, who asked for assurances that any arms embargo against them as proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should be delayed until early this summer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ban on arms sales because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not accepted a cease-fire agreement in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. There have been no diplomatic relations since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was stormed Nov. 4, 1979, and held for 444 days with diplomats and others kept hostage inside.

 Leaping luggage and sniffing out sneaky smugglers, the latest addition to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s K-9 corps has racked up impressive credits in his first two months on the beat, his human colleagues say. King, a romping 2-year-old cross between a black Labrador retriever and a German short-haired pointer, has a nose that makes news. Since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gave King to <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police, he has sniffed out $ 86,000 in drug-scented cash, 347 pounds of cocaine and helped collar four suspects, said police Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. The beloved rookie, one of three canines used by <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police at the airport, has all but matched the 400-pound career total of <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON>, who just retired after about a decade, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` He's an up-and-coming dog,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said of the enthusiastic pooch, who with handler Detective <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON>, graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> dog training school in Front Royal, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. King and <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> were still getting used to the domestic flight areas of <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> after their December graduation when they made their first score Dec. 17 A man carrying Christmas presents on a flight from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> fit the profile of a smuggler. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police had been suspicious. The man agreed to a search and King `` alerted'' to a drug odor in his packages. More than $ 40,000 in drug-tainted cash was discovered, <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> said. The fact that a specially trained dog identified the money as having been associated with narcotics was probable cause to seize it, <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> said. Soon afterward, King found a similar amount of drug-tainted cash packed in a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>. The two occupants of the car were arrested and are awaiting trial in <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> said. King's abilities also led to the discovery of 185 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees on Feb. 1. The next day, he sniffed out 155 pounds of cocaine concealed underneath the floor in the belly of an L-1011 aircraft. He detected 7 pounds of cocaine on an earlier search to bring his total to 347 pounds, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` I worked mostly narcotics for the last 16 years,'' said <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON>. `` The biggest seizure I made was 600 pounds and it took me almost 10 years. But working with a detector dog, we've found almost 400 pounds in the first two months we were back from school. `` We're both still a green team. I've been a police officer for 18 years but I feel like a rookie again. It's like a whole new career,'' he said. While King has a `` super-fine nose,'' he is not perfect, <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> said. King gets tired sometimes while working his eight-hour shift, `` but so far he's been on the money,'' he said. Detector dogs can not sniff the enormous volume of luggage, freight and planes used to smuggle narcotics and money through this primary port of entry for drugs, <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> said. Any dog and its handler are only as good as the watchful authorities who suggest likely targets. `` It was mostly luck and being in the right place at the right time,'' <PERSON> Buzzi </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON>, accused of hurling a firebomb at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, saw his lawyer for the first time five minutes before he appeared in military court. The 19-year-old signed a confession written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>, a language he does not know, and said interrogators abused him. As authorities round up growing numbers of Arab suspects in an effort to quell nearly three months of unrest, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s methods of detaining and trying Palestinians has drawn a hail of criticism. `` I feel totally helpless in this sham of a system,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a Palestinian who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> law school in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>. `` In 98 percent of the cases, lawyers can not see Palestinian clients until after they ` confess,' and judges will accept the ` confession' at face value, no matter what you say,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON>, shackled and dressed in a blue-jeans jacket, flashed a V-for-victory sign as he entered the tiny courtroom in a closed army base. He waved to his father, whom he was seeing for the first time since his arrest. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON> had been held incommunicado for 18 days, until he signed a four-page confession. He said he signed only after interrogators beat him, deprived him of sleep and forced him to squat in a corner for hours. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said it was unlikely his client's contentions would be accepted in court. Allegations of unfairness in the military court system prompted the attorneys' association in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to decide to boycott all military court proceedings. But Israeli officials argue the system is fair. `` There are some exceptions. But a defendant who feels he was mistreated during interrogation can raise the issue in court, where due process of law is ensured,'' army prosecutor <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Giora </PERSON>, a native of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said in an interview. <PERSON> Giora </PERSON> and other Israelis argue the only obvious shortcoming in the military court system was redressed by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> earlier this month when he announced that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, after 20 years of occupation, would establish army appeal courts. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said figures assembled by Palestinian lawyers show the total number of Arab detainees, normally about 3,000 at any one time, has doubled and the army has set up four new prisons with tent barracks in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. According to the army, 1,927 Palestinians were arrested and 93 placed in jail for six months without trial under emergency regulations from Dec. 8 to Feb. 9. The Arab-owned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> puts the number of Arabs jailed without trial at 147. The process from arrest to trial in the military court system is well documented. A Palestinian suspected of participating in anti-Israeli activities is usually detained in the middle of the night because soldiers fear their presence in Arab towns or refugee camps during the day might spark protests. The detainee is handcuffed, often blindfolded, and taken to a military prison. No arrest warrant is ever shown and family members are not told where the suspect is being taken. It often takes a lawyer several weeks to track down his new client, who can be held incommunicado for up to six months. A judge is required to order a detention extension after the first 18 days. `` During the period of interrogation, the detainee is routinely subjected to beatings, forced to spend long hours in uncomfortable positions, threatened and submitted to other psychological measures,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said. `` Usually before the first 18-day period is up, the defendant breaks down and confesses to a variety of illegal activities,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said. `` Only after this is he permitted to see an attorney, and only then is the attorney told what charges his client faces.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON> entered court with five other Arab defendants, four of whom had no attorney present. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> was able to see his client and the charge sheet against him only minutes before the court session began. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> argued in court that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON> signed the confession only after being abused. He asked for, and was granted, a separate hearing about the admissiblity of the evidence. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said he did not intend actually to present a case on whether the evidence should be admitted, but only to use the extra time to try to plea bargain a shorter sentence. `` If I protest, his interrogator will deny it and he will just end up getting a tougher sentence,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said. `` What hurts most about the process is the pretense of propriety,'' he said. `` With a judge and a prosecutor and a defense attorney, it looks all right from the outside. But in fact, on a certain level, I feel I am a collaborator in the evil system.'' `` At least I brought him some cigarettes,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Leban </PERSON>, shaking his head as he left court. `` I've turned into a social worker more than a lawyer in this system.''

 The fertile <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bottom lands where the <LOCATION> Arikara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hidatsa </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mandan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> thrived for seven centuries are gone forever, buried beneath the waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sakakawea </LOCATION>. The 200-mile-long reservoir drove the Indians onto higher, less productive land, sliced their reservation into isolated sections and is blamed for precipitating soaring unemployment and alcoholism. The three tribes, who say they were coerced into surrendering the bottom lands without just compensation as the lake filled behind <LOCATION> Garrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, believe they have a chance this year to get $ 178.4 million that they and a special federal commission think they deserve. `` The problem has been with us for 40 years. The time is right for a resolution,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> Lone Fight. The tribes, which total about 7,700 people, are asking the state's congressional delegation to introduce legislation that would give them $ 3.6 million a year for 50 years plus 4 percent interest on the unpaid balance of the settlement. The money would come from federal hydropower revenues, rather than the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, which tribal leaders believe should make the legislation more palatable to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bill also would fund municipal water projects on the reservation and authorize, but not pay for, replacement of a hospital and other facilities destroyed by the reservoir. Lone Fight says the bill `` is something that's supportable'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> opposes further compensation for the tribes. Rural electric cooperatives do n't like the idea of dipping into hydropower revenues. And members of the state's congressional delegation have yet to support the bill. `` We hope that something can be introduced this session. But until we can find something that everyone feels comfortable with, nothing can be introduced,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrem </PERSON>, an aide to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs. The tribes accepted $ 12.6 million from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1950, but <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> was already built and <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakakawea </PERSON> was forming when the money was offered. The tribes and their supporters say the Indians had no choice but to take the settlement. `` When the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> people were negotiating for the best possible deal, the water was up to their ankles ... and the offers were going down,'' Lone Fight said. When dam construction began in the 1940s, 90 percent of the Indians lived and farmed in the river valley, as their ancestors had for seven centuries. Unemployment on the reservation was negligible. Today, unemployment exceeds 50 percent and alcoholism is rampant, problems that have been linked to the disruption caused by Garrison Dam. About 3,400 Indians live on the reservation; another 4,300 tribal members live elsewhere. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakakawea </PERSON> is named for a Shoshone guide who worked for the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> expedition up the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1804. `` In my 66 years, I have seen a drastic change from being self-sufficent to being a very desperate economic situation,'' said <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinnell </PERSON>, a tribal judge. <ORGANIZATION> Grinnell </ORGANIZATION> grew up on a family farm near <LOCATION> Elbowoods </LOCATION>, the reservation's main town before it was inundated. The tribes grew their own vegetables and cattle, cut firewood from trees along the river and mined nearby coal deposits, <ORGANIZATION> Grinnell </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We never heard of unemployment because everyone had their farms, and those who had jobs did n't farm,'' <ORGANIZATION> Grinnell </ORGANIZATION> said. A five-member panel appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> concluded in 1986 that the tribes were owed $ 178 million to $ 412 million in compensation. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed with Indian claims that the lake destroyed their self-sufficient way of life and precipitated the tribes' continuing social problems. If the tribes get the settlement, the money would be earmarked for programs, such as work projects and alcohol treatment, that would attack the reservation's social ills, Lone Fight said. However, in a recent meeting with tribal leaders, Assistant Secretary for <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> claimed that the tribes have been adequately compensated through the federal services they receive. Swimmer's position was characterized by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, an attorney for the tribes, as `` disingenuous.'' Bureau of Indian Affairs officials will meet soon with members of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation to discuss the tribes' proposal, <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said

 Enrollment is up and the debt is down at <ORGANIZATION> Fisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where only a few years ago students shivered in unheated dormitories because the historically black private institution could not pay its gas bill. As Fisk winds down its celebration of Black History Month, which included the dedication of a stamp honoring author <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, faculty and students also celebrated the university's return from the brink of financial disaster When the <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cut off service in early 1984 until <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> paid a $ 170,000 debt, students brought space heaters to class and joined with faculty and staff members to raise funds to ensure the university's survival. The overall debt mounted to $ 4.1 million, but classes continued. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponder </PERSON>, appointed <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>'s president in July 1984, led the school on a course of austerity programs and aggressive fund-raising. When Ponder was told, for example, that boiler repairs would cost $ 350,000, he found a Fisk alumnus, a maintenance expert, who did it for only $ 60,000. Ponder acknowledged in a recent interview that things are better at <LOCATION> Fisk </LOCATION>, but added `` you have to get the public to understand that help is still needed to get the resources to move this institution ... to the forefront of educational institutions in this country. `` I do n't say that lightly. That's where we've been and we will get back,'' said Ponder, who said the school did not lower its academic standards during its financial troubles. Today, debt at <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> has been reduced to $ 200,000 and its endowment has reached $ 3.9 million. An unrestricted gift of $ 1.3 million by entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> in December 1986 gave the school a boost, but officials say they have received substantial grass-roots support, too. However, three of the university's 23 trustees announced Friday that they will resign at the end of the school year. One trustee said the resignations were related to the accountability of those charged with day-to-day administration. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>'s financial aid director and assistant director were fired in December for allegedly failing to fill out forms to receive financial aid. Faculty salaries have increased 30 percent over the last three years to an average of $ 32,000 for a tenured professor, although still below the $ 35,000 to $ 40,000 Ponder said is appropriate. Aggressive recruiting of students brought enrollment, which dipped to 500 at one point, up to 644 students in the 1988 spring semester, an increase of 27 percent over the 1987 spring semester, said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShields </PERSON>, director of the office of admissions and records. <PERSON> Bryon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, a student from <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>'s role in black history in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was important to him. `` <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> introduced the black spiritual to the world, it was active in the civil rights movement, W.E.B. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> went to college here,'' <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, `` My understanding is that a degree from <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> is as respected as one from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>.'' The financial crisis at the school had some positive benefits for the Fisk community, said <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, now a graduate student. `` The student body handled the crisis well, we shared space heaters. It united us. We were able to confront a problem and come through it,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> sid. The university, founded in 1867 by the Freedmen's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> during Reconstruction, is no stranger to struggle. In fact, the campus was purchased with $ 150,000 raised by the college's Jubilee Singers during a European tour in the 1870s. The earnings of the singers, whose tours still bring $ 60,000 a year to <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, also paid for building Jubilee Hall, whose exterior was recently restored with a $ 150,000 federal grant. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a poet who was a diplomat and an early organizer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, was a professor at <LOCATION> Fisk </LOCATION> in the early 1930s. W.E.B. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON>, a philosopher and writer who graduated from <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> in 1888, also helped found the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and was the first black to earn a doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think students are attracted here because it has the reputation of a good community. When they get here, they find out we have a dynamic science faculty and many of our students go to medical and dental schools,'' Ponder said. About 60 percent of <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> graduates enroll for postgraduate study. <PERSON> Revais </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, executive assistant to the president and a history professor, said <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>'s financial problems mirrored those of other liberal arts college, but were worse. `` In the 1960s and 1970s the philosophy of supporting a liberal arts education dried up and the interest shifted to business degrees,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the quality of education at <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> has never suffered and that peeling paint and cold classrooms do n't mean poor academics. `` I try to tell my students that there has always been an element of suffering in the tradition of black education,'' he said.

<HEAD>Three Mexican Nationals Convicted In Murder Of U.S. Customs Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Mexican nationals, including a former Mexican police detective charged in the torture-murder of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent, were convicted of conspiring to murder a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent. The charges grew out of a series of meetings with an undercover investigator in which defendant <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> offered to murder the Customs agent for a $ 25,000 fee. No killing took place. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 29, who also faces charges in the 1985 slaying of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, was convicted Friday of conspiracy to murder a federal agent and conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent. Two men <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> hired in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to assist him, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 22, also were convicted in the conspiracy. <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was acquitted on a charge that he traveled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to carry out the murder plot. The men could receive life imprisonment. Sentencing was scheduled for April 18 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rymer </PERSON>. Lawyers for the defendants had argued that <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and the two men he hired never intended to carry out the murder, but had planned all along to stage a `` rip-off'' of the undercover drug agent with whom they were negotiating. They believed that the undercover agent was a narcotics dealer. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a former homicide investigator for the Mexican state judicial police, told undercover agents he was an `` enforcer'' for the powerful narcotics organization of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> and had a direct role in <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s abduction and torture In 12 hours of government tapes presented as evidence, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> bragged about his knowledge of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s torture and promised to repeat it on the Customs agent. `` If it was part of a scam, they oversold it too much,'' said jury foreman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON>, 28, a postal worker from <LOCATION> Alhambra </LOCATION>. `` Especially when they talked about killing someone _ you looked at their faces, and they showed no remorse.'' Nine people have been indicted in the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case, two of whom will be tried with <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> are jailed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in connection with the case. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> had been charged in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> murder, but was later released.

 A man accused of attempting to sexually assault actress <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON>, a co-host of the Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> pageant here, was rearrested Saturday after a judge's decision to set him free on $ 100 bond sparked protests. He later was freed again after posting a much higher bond. The man, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, was initially arrested Thursday night after the assault in a hotel elevator. He was released early Friday on $ 100 bond set by associate municipal magistrate <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. But the low bond infuriated State District Judge <PERSON> Brunson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, as well as Miss <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> ordered him arrested again. <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> turned himself in at 9:35 a.m. Saturday and jailed again on $ 100,000 bond. He posted the required 15 percent of that amount later in the day and was freed after spending about five hours in custody. Officials said the man originally gave authorities a false name, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. He was re-arrested through the help of his attorney, according to sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Paco </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>. `` I'm shocked and I'm outraged,'' Miss <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON> said Friday after the suspect's release. `` What this says to me is that a man like this can save himself a whole expensive night of dinner and dancing and just pay $ 100 to assault the woman of his choice. That's a pretty good deal.'' Miss <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON>, who starred in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television series `` The Colbys,'' suffered minor bruises during the attack. Security guards and other guests who heard her screams came to her aid and subdued the attacker, she said. If convicted, <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined up to $ 5,000. Miss <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> to be co-host of the Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> pageant, which will be broadcast live Tuesday nationwide.

 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said Saturday that <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president, decided on his own to go into hiding, but that he remained in telephone contact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is `` safe and in high spirits'' after escaping arrest, and the struggle against the country's military leader will continue, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s envoy to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The permanent council of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, after a lengthy and at times heated debate Saturday night on the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, took no position on the turmoil there. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials denied participating in <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s escape, though they said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, was in contact with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> by telephone. They said they were not sure what <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s next move would be. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who usually spends weekends at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> receiving reports on the fast-moving situation. The 30-member <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> council sidestepped a decision on whether to seat as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the organization <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON>, the current envoy who is loyal to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military chief <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Larence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s delegate. There had been indications from officials of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation that the council would seat neither man, chosing instead to recognize <PERSON> Soraya </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> career diplomat who is a member of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> delegation to the OAS. The start of the formal council debate had been delayed for five hours while the envoys wrangled in private over the question of whom to credential as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s representative. But when the debate commenced, shortly after 9 p.m. EST, no resolutions were offered dealing with that sticky question. Instead, <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> was admitted to take part in the debate, at least for the time being, and he launched into a tirade against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, accusing it of trying to destabilize his government. `` I wish to somehow resolve the crisis in the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> said. `` But this is not the forum.'' <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> steadfastly denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been involved in drug trafficking, although the former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, told the council, `` We are suffering a new phenomenon _ narco-militarism. This narcotic militarism knows no frontier.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not accept the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in which <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed `` in a 10-minute rump session.'' In a riveting moment, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> technicians play an audio-cassette in which he had tape-recorded the telephone conversation with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON>, as Panamanian military personnel surrounded her house after her husband had fled. Mrs. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, in a trembling voice, described how she had told the officers `` My husband is n't here, nor are you going to find him.'' A member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission, declining to be identified publicly, indicated that a part of the problem for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors in deciding which Panamanian representative to credential was that they had doubts about what stance they should take. `` They're afraid of doing something which might prejudice the position their government has taken'' on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the official said. <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> said questions also had been raised about whether <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallont </PERSON>, had the right to request the special session, with some ambassadors who support <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opposing it. <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> said those who oppose having the issue debated in the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> `` simply do n't want the rest of the world to know what's going on in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' He said the ambassadors had not allowed him or Leyton to address the gathering. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador accredited to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Saturday'' that he was in touch with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and `` we understand he is physically all right, he's safe and in high spirits,'' `` The struggle that President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is leading now is a struggle to get the country back to civilian rule and get the country into democratic process and that's what the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people want,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said `` That's why we feel we are going to carry the struggle, carry this fight.'' `` The Panamanian people are going to rally behind the constitutional president, he is going to win this out,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had nothing to do with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s decision to leave his house to avoid arrest, but that the Panamanian had been in touch with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> by telephone. They denied initially that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> knew <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s whereabouts, but later in the day, when asked if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials knew where <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had gone, they said, `` he is at an undisclosed location. According to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials' account, soldiers came to <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s house at 8 a.m. and were met at the door by <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s wife While the soldiers were telling her they wanted to take <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the president escaped out a back door, the officials said. `` It was his own decision, we did not do this,'' said one official, when asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had participated in <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s escape. Several of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s family members, including several children and grandchildren, stayed overnight at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the officials said. The officials reaffirmed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to continue recognizing <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president, despite his replacement by a cabinet minister loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s flight posed a dilemma for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers because his departure for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or another country would remove a key anti-Noriega symbol around which opposition to military rule could gather. Administration officials said on Saturday they hoped to marshal international support behind <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s presidency, notably among Central American nations. High-level meetings continued at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where officials described the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as calm. They said the 10,000 American troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ assigned to protection of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> _ were continuing to keep a low profile. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy toward <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has grown increasingly hostile in recent months and the sentiment intensified after Feb. 5, when two federal grand juries returned indictments portraying him as a key conspirator in an international drug trafficking operation. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had been viewed by the administration as little more than a front man for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but that all changed Thursday evening when he broke with the military chieftain.

 <PERSON> Debi </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' dream of Olympic gold turned into disappointment Saturday as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Katarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen. `` It's over. Back to school,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who won the bronze medal despite three faulty landings. `` I'm not going to make any excuses. I was really skating well this week. It was n't supposed to happen, I guess. But I tried.'' While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to music from <PERSON> Bizet </PERSON>'s `` Carmen,'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> was so sensational in the freestyle that she finished first with seven judges. Combined with a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the short program earlier in the week, the performance put <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> in second place. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, a three-time world champion from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, became the first repeat singles champion since <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Button </PERSON> took Olympic gold in 1948 and'52. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Henie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> was the only woman to do it before <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the first black to win a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games. By contrast, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> had the sellout crowd at the Olympic Saddledome enraptured. They cheered, hooted and stamped their feet when she finished hitting every element of her program. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, finished fourth. She was fifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of the overall score. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> won the men's crown, and a bronze in pairs went to <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppegard </PERSON>. In addition to the three figure skating medals, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze. Speed skater <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only double medalist, tried again Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well off the pace. She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000 meters. As the Olympics winded up its next-to-last day, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had 27 medals, including 11 golds, while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in second place had 22, including nine golds.

 <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, the infant who won the hearts of supporters from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when she became the youngest liver transplant recipient five years ago, died Saturday at her home here. She was 5 years old. The transplanted liver <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> received on May 10, 1983, had begun to fail around Thanksgiving, said her mother, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>. On Dec. 11, the family took <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, where the transplant had been performed. But the girl returned home Jan. 16 after doctors said her chances for recovery were not good. `` She could n't stand it anymore,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. `` We made a promise that we would n't take her back to the hospital. We brought her home and the family took turns being with her.'' `` She's at peace now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. People throughout the region rallied in late 1982 and early 1983 to raise more than $ 260,000 through a variety of fund-raisers to pay for what then was considered an experimental transplant operation. The rock group Kiss performed a benefit concert for <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> in 1983 at <LOCATION> Kiel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Auditorium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. That same year, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> received a letter of support from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` If it was n't for the community getting together, we would n't have had five years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said `` She was the joy of our life. She was very strong. She fought all the way to the end.'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> was 11 months old at the time of the transplant. At that time, she was believed to be the world's youngest liver transplant patient. That record since has been broken, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON>, media relations director for <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON> said the survival rate of most liver transplant patients improves with time. `` Usually, but not always, doctors like to say that you are over the hump after five years, but one can never say never. There are just too many complications,'' she said. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> died nearly four years and 10 months after her transplant. She would have turned 6 years old June 1. Besides her parents, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> is survived by two brothers. Funeral services were set for Monday.

 An <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> inmate who had armed himself with a screwdriver and took three hostages gave up late Saturday after he was apparently overpowered by a hostage staff member. <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said the hostage situation ended shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday, more than 12 hours after it began. `` There was some kind of a scuffle'' inside the office where inmate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was holding two prisoners and a staff counselor, <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said. The four men then came walking out. `` Everyone seems to be fine,'' <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said. `` There appears to be no serious problems.'' He said the hostages, identified as prison counselor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryden </PERSON> and inmates <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, were taken to the prison's medical unit to be examined for injuries. `` We do n't know exactly what happened yet,'' <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said. `` It looks like the officer -LRB- <PERSON> Ryden </PERSON> -RRB- was able to overpower the inmate.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s only weapon was apparently a screwdriver, authorities said. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a public information officer at the prison, said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> grabbed <PERSON> Ryden </PERSON>, a correctional counselor, at about 10:20 a.m. after they went together to an office to discuss a problem. `` The other two inmates were out cleaning and painting and entered the office to get more supplies at which time they became hostages themselves,'' she said. Saturday afternoon, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s request for a pitcher of tea was granted in exchange for allowing a prison doctor to examine <PERSON> Ryden </PERSON>. The counselor had his blood pressure checked and `` seemed fine,'' Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had demanded that the warden contact the governor's office and that he be allowed to have an attorney present when he presented his grievances Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> declined to say what the grievances were, other than to say that he originally approached the counselor with a complaint about his prison diet. Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is serving a 15-year sentence for second-degree burglary and had been an inmate at the prison since 1986. Warden <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Saffle </PERSON> had said he would n't meet with <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> or contact the governor's office until the situation has ended, Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said that approximately80 prisoners live in the cells in the section of the prison where the incident took place, and `` all are in their cells.'' The McAlester penitentiary was the site of an uprising in December 1985 when inmates protesting prison conditions held seven hostages for nearly 17 hours before releasing them unharmed. The institution has been under a 23-hour-a-day lockdown since that episode, officials said.

 <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> fled his house hours after government agents warned him to leave the country, a relative said. The deposed president later vowed from hiding Saturday to fight any attempt to expel him. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> slipped away on foot `` to protect himself'' _ to avoid arrest and deportation by military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the ousted president's brother-in-law, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, told reporters. `` I'm going to stay here and I'm going to stick it out. I'm going to fight it all the way,'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> later told ABC News by telephone `` I want you to let the world to know that I'm in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, that you spoke to me, that I'm not leaving anywhere.'' He refused to disclose his whereabouts. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and had been in contact with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said it had been contacted by the ousted president, and quoted the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was not at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installation. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s canal zone is headquarters to the 10,000-troop <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The National Assembly, with opposition lawmakers boycotting, ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> Friday, a day after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as Defense Forces chief. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who controls the 15,000-strong military and police and is the power behind the civilian government, is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking charges and claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was behind the attempt to fire him. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said security agents under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s command had on Friday told <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> refused to accept his ouster. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also continued to recognize him. <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, sister of the ousted president, said family members had visited him and found, `` He is well, calm, in a secure place and continues carrying out his functions as president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Deposed Vice President <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> and his family also dropped out of sight Saturday. Top officials of his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they had talked to him by telephone, but said he would not reveal his whereabouts out of concern for his safety. <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> was dismissed early Friday along with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Meanwhile, a national strike called by the main opposition group got off to a slow start Saturday. Soldiers came to <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s house at 8 a.m. and were met at the door by <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON>. While the soldiers were telling her they wanted to take <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the president escaped out a back door, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had been in telephone contact with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and that members of his family were at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomats said they expected <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government would file criminal charges against the deposed president. Bereft of power, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> told reporters Friday night: `` I do n't have a seat of government, nor military support, but I do have 2 million Panamanians who are tired and bored of living under a regime that one man has governed capriciously, and because of that I call for national resistance to paralyze the entire country starting Monday. He also urged a worldwide trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The opposition National Civic Crusade called an immediate general strike. The coalition of 200 groups has been calling since last June for the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has run the country since 1983. <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, said the Crusade hoped to `` totally paralyze'' the nation by early next week. Still, most shops and other businesses were open Saturday morning, although they traditionally close their doors at noon for the remainder of the weekend. Police threw up barricades Friday and blocked the short street in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s modest but modern home is located, refusing to allow <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., to visit <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> Other policemen could be seen in the front yard of the small house. At noon Saturday, the barricades where withdrawn. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> then came out and spoke to reporters. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said a police officer called at the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> home Saturday morning and told family members the former president should leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Later, he said security agents had also contacted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> Friday, warning him to leave the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal since he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Feb. 5 on drug trafficking charges. The indictment says <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allegedly let <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> narcotics traffickers use <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a base for smuggling cocaine and marijuana into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, receiving kickbacks from drug profits. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has blamed protests that began last summer and the indictment on efforts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conservatives to prevent transfer of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to this country by the end of 1999. American military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were on alert and civilians were told to keep a low profile.

<HEAD>Life Support Pulled From Texas Infant With Almost No Brain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> infant born with almost no brain was taken off life-support equipment that was intended to help preserve her tiny heart and other organs for transplantation, a doctor said Saturday. `` Baby <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> continues to breathe on her own, but shows signs of gradual deterioration,'' Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON>, chief of neonatology at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement late Saturday. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON> was born with a fatal genetic birth defect known as anencephaly, in which much of the upper brain and skull are missing. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> has developed the nation's first guidelines using such infants as organ donors. However, little <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> never met the hospital's criteria for brain-death since she was born seven days ago, and machine-assisted breathing was stopped Saturday, with her parents' consent, <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> said. Although three newborns needing healthy livers had been identified during the week, the likelihood of a vital organ transplant dropped to nil, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> will be allowed to die naturally, she said. `` It is highly unlikely that she will be able to donate organs such as liver and heart, because without continuation of assisted breathing, oxygen deprivation of these organs will occur prior to her death,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. Details about the potential liver recipients were n't disclosed, but Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said they were n't at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> was born Feb. 20 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, 22, and Airman <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, 21, stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The infant was flown to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> that same day to be used in the donor program. Anencephalic babies usually die within days after birth. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, a pioneer in infant heart transplants, has sought to establish a practice of sustaining anencephalic babies so vital organs can be used after brain death is certified by two independent physicians. Under the hospital's rules, however, no baby is kept on life-support longer than a week, whether brain death has occurred during that time or not. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> doctors anticipate that <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>'s heart valves, and perhaps corneas will be donated after her heart stops, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. The same day <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> was born, another anencephalic baby, identified only as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, died at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> after efforts find a suitable liver or heart recipient were unsuccessful. He had been declared brain dead two days earlier. In his case, doctors were able to use a heart valve after he died.

 A Sikh extremist wanted in the 1986 murder of former army chief <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaidya </PERSON> was killed Saturday in a gunbattle with police, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency quoted <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state police chief <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Surindra </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was killed after he was challenged by a police patrol in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the state capital. One of the militant's accomplices, identified as <PERSON> Harjinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was also killed while another was injured, <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Surindra </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is one of the more than 20 militants believed to be involved in the Aug. 10, 1986 assassination of <LOCATION> Vaidya </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pune </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Two others, <PERSON> Ranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sukhminder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, were arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> last year and are facing extradition proceedings. Another eight suspects have been arrested in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vaidya </PERSON> was the army chief when soldiers stormed the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> in 1984 to dislodge <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists who were using it as a base. Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards later in the year. Meanwhile, police in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, 130 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, blamed Sikh extremists for the killing of seven members of a Sikh family in a nearby village. <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> said the family was slain Friday night by six Sikhs armed with automatic rifles. The killings occurred in <LOCATION> Talwandi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chamchuk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. UNI quoted unnamed police sources as saying the family apparently refused to pay extortion money to the <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, one of several Sikh militant groups active in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. In other militant-related violence in the state, a Hindu policeman was killed by Sikh radicals early Saturday near the town of <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, police said. The killings raised to at least 304 the numkber of people killed this year in attacks blamed on Sikh militants. Nearly two-thirds of the victims have been Sikhs. Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1983 for a separate state in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, which they propose to call <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>. Last year, more than 1,000 people were killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> by the militants. Sikhs, whose religion is an offshoot of <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu majority. Sikhs comprise about 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 Arab reports said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers opened fire to quell riots sparked by Jewish settlers who tried to enter a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village at night. The army on Sunday confirmed two Arabs were shot to death. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> sank a boat carrying guerrillas who were en route from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to launch an attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Lebanese police said two Palestinian fighters were killed in the incident Saturday night and three swam to shore. Also, three Arab guerrillas were killed in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> early Sunday after they stormed an outpost of pro-Israeli Lebanese militiamen in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yaoun </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border, the army said. The violence came as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, continuing his efforts aimed at starting Arab-Israeli peace talks and helping restore calm in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But the bloodshed has increased since he arrived Thursday on the five-day mission. At least 11 Palestinians have been killed and dozens more wounded in the occupied lands in the period. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 24-member Cabinet debated the violence on Sunday, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Transportation Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON> proposed closing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to media coverage. No decision was reported on the issue. Israeli soldiers on Sunday sealed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Abud </LOCATION>, 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where the two Arabs were killed Saturday night. They twice turned away a reporter who tried to talk to witnesses. Army spokesmen said the shootings were being investigated. The Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Jewish settlers had tried to enter the village after nightfall and were turned away by the 3,000 residents. Soldiers arrived about 8 p.m. and clashed with villagers who hurled stones. They fired flares to provide light and later opened fire with live ammunition, the agency said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> demonstrators blocked a main highway outside the village and stoned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. It said a number of Jewish settlers also arrived on the scene. Shots were fired, and the army was investigating the source of the gunfire, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> added. The Palestine Press identified the two dead as <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON>, 17, who was shot in the head, and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON>, 22, who was wounded in the stomach.

 Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuerl </PERSON> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholics should help pay the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 56.7 million operating deficit. <PERSON> Wuerl </PERSON>, named head of the Diocese of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on Feb. 12, said the deficit was created when <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> `` raised salaries substantially,'' to help employees keep up with the cost of living. `` How do we pay for this?'' he said Friday. `` In the past we have always said to the pope, `` Good Luck.'''

<HEAD>Congress Faces New Battle on Contra Aid</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> faces a confusing choice this week between two rival versions of a plan to help the Nicaraguan rebels. A vote is scheduled for Thursday to decide whether the U.S.-backed Contras will get an aid package drafted by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, a similar one drawn up by House Republicans, or nothing at all. Current authority to aid the Contras expires at midnight Monday, and the rebels are said to be rapidly running out of items like food, clothing and medicine that the new aid plans would provide. Both versions of the new aid package would keep non-lethal supplies flowing to the rebels at their positions inside Nicaraguan territory. Neither would provide new weapons. And both would set up a $ 14 million program to help war-injured children on all sides of the conflict. But while similar in what they would do for the rebels in the short term, the two versions set starkly different ground rules for an impending rematch between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over military aid for the rebels. The Democratic version, which <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders say they are confident will pass, holds out the possbility that a new military aid package could be considered sometime after June 1. But the conditions for such consideration are strict: it could happen only if the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> certifies that the Contras and the leftist Sandinista government have not reached a cease-fire and that it is the Sandinistas' fault. Then, the proposal would allow _ but not require _ the party's leadership to bring forth an aid proposal of its own design, and would allow amendment of the package on the floor The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> aid proposal would give the president, rather than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the right to design the military aid package, and would leave to him the determination whether a cease-fire is in effect, and whether any failure to reach a truce is the fault of the Sandinista regime. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could make such a request as soon as April 16, and it would have to be acted on by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> without delay. A similar expedited procedure was followed when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 3 rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s previous aid request, which included weapons and other military supplies, by a vote of 219 to 211. Another difference between the two packages is that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> version would leave authority to deliver the aid in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which has been supervising a fairly successful airdrop program. Democrats, many of whom are suspicious of the spy agency, would turn the delivery program over to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to supervise, keeping the same private contractors, planes and crews now doing the work. The showdown over the two competing aid packages was supposed to have occured last week, but Democrats postponed action at the last minute, citing confusion among lawmakers over the differences between the two bills. Republicans said the real reason for the delay was that the majority feared it was losing supporters to their competing version. Part of the difficulty Democrats have faced is division among outside peace groups which lobbied hard to defeat <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military aid proposal earlier this month and were reluctant to now turn around and support a Contra aid package, no matter how `` humanitarian'' its terms. Some groups, including Presbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers and <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>, were supporting the Democratic package in hopes it would lessen the pressure for a future request for Contra weapons. But representatives of the Unitarian, Methodist, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> churches wrote lawmakers last week that `` we believe it is important that no aid in any form be provided that would assist the Contras in maintaining an armed force to wage war against the government and the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' House leaders were meeting with such outside groups to try to persuade them to unite behind the Democratic proposal before Thursday's vote, and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., a supporter the party's package, expressed impatience with the groups' all-or-nothing `` Any theology student will tell you the first thing you learn is that the greatest enemy of morality is moralism,'' Obey said. `` If your goal is to save lives and wind the war down, then you have to have tactics and strategy as well as good wishes. I wish liberals could count -LRB- votes -RRB- as well as they can feel.''

 Fad health diets and `` marketplace gimmickry'' are giving Americans a distorted view of the type and amount of foods needed to help prevent chronic disease, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. In a paper prepared for congressional testimony on Tuesday, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said isolated studies, taken out of context and promoted by special economic interests, often trigger changes in the American diet that may actually be harmful. `` Too many Americans believe in magic bullets. Too many corporations believe in profit-rich products with very specific health claims,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. Such `` marketplace gimmickry,'' he said, does not help Americans avoid the so-called `` diseases of affluence'' of osteoporosis and heart attack. In a paper prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> governmental affairs committee, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> recommended that the government establish a national research center to collect and analyze nutrition information so Americans can receive more accurate information on diet and health. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> directed a massive study of the diet and lifestyle of 6,500 persons in 130 locations in the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in an effort to determine how nutrition affects such diseases as cancer and heart attack. He said the study is not yet finished, but results so far cast doubt on some of the popular American beliefs about nutrition and health. Among his observations: _ American studies have shown that a serum cholesterol reading of 180 milligrams per decaliter can reduce the risk of heart attack Yet, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> study showed that a reduction in cholesterol raises the risk of colon cancer. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the cholesterol levels are far below the typical American level, and the incidence of colon cancer also is low. This shows, he said, that the study showing an increase in colon cancer with lower cholesterol `` is an experimental aberration.'' _ Excess calories may not be the sole cause of obesity, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said He said the Chinese consume about 20 percent more calories than do Americans, yet obesity is rare among the Chinese. He said Chinese average only about 15 percent of their calories in the form of fat _ far below the typical American. _ Some American studies have suggested that an increase in fiber in the diet may lead to a loss of minerals <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the Chinese consume about 34 grams of fiber per day, versus about 10 grams for most Americans, and yet the Chinese show healthy levels of iron, zinc and magnesium, all important minerals.

 About 1,000 people, trying to buck the Chinese system of assigned jobs for life, gathered Sunday at the opening of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s first citywide labor market. A mostly young crowd, bundled up in heavy greatcoats, peered at job description posters lining the street and discussed work opportunities with representatives of 22 factories and companies who manned desks inside the `` Labor Exchange Center.'' The center, said deputy chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenyong </PERSON>, was set up by the city <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to carry out the government policy of allowing people to find jobs more suitable to their needs and skills. Those who pay a fee of 27 cents will have their names placed on the center's computerized list and receive help in finding a new job, he said. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanxin </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Tienma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies tourist items to department stores, said many people want to find new work closer to their homes. `` Others just do n't like their present jobs,'' he said, adding that his company found seven prospective new employees Sunday morning. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Hongjun </PERSON>, 34, said she was applying for a job with a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> wine company because it has night shifts, allowing her to care for a sick sister during the day. She said she could also take a bus to the winery, rather than commute by bicycle as she does to her current job. A personnel officer at <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which is looking for nine cooks, electricians, drivers and other workers, said factory workers are attracted to the school's long summer and winter holidays. Many, said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingxiang </PERSON>, also want their children to attend the excellent kindergarten and primary schools run by the university. Since the 1949 communist takeover, Chinese have had little choice in determining their career. Under a system known as `` fen pei,'' Chinese were assigned a job for life from which they could not be fired, but neither could they leave. High school and elementary school graduates were assigned work in local businesses or, if they come from the countryside, were generally returned to the land to farm with the rest of their family. College graduates, a scarce resource here, were sent anywhere in the country that needed them. A student, majoring in English literature at prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, could, for example, wind up in barren <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province, teaching English to barely literate peasants. But in recent years, cracks have appeared in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` iron rice bowl'' as the country has sought to speed its economic development. The Chinese government has recognized that its traditional labor system has deadened worker creativity and kept workers from fully using their talents. It also has split families, especially those of the educated classes. Indeed, it is not unusual for couples with college educations to be assigned jobs in different provinces, thousands of miles away from one another. As a result, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has begun loosening restrictions on job-hopping and encouraging the 20 million people who have gone off on their own to set up small private businesses. However, the work units to which each Chinese is assigned still regard employees as the property of the unit and often refuse a job transfer or exact compensation for the loss of a worker. Engineers, scientists and other trained people in particular have had difficulty leaving their old jobs because of their value to the work unit. That creates the ironic condition that the better one does one's job here, the less of a chance one has to leave it for something better `` It's true that if a person has a position of responsibility it will be more difficult for him to change jobs,'' said the center's <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> `` But if his work unit refuses to let him go, we will do what we can to help, including assist in finding a replacement.'' Similar labor markets have appeared at the city district level in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but the center that opened Sunday is the first to cover the entire city. Illegal work markets have also sprung up in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and in several other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. Their purpose generally is not to help employed people find a new job, but to help unemployed peasants enter the urban labor force, allowing them to abandon the difficult life in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s countryside. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said the city-wide labor market will also stay open in the evenings and on Sundays to accommodate people who have difficulty getting away from their jobs to look for new ones.

<HEAD>Roman Amphitheater Found In London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists said Sunday they discovered the remains of a Roman amphitheater 15 feet below <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district in one of the most important finds in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this century. Historians had been looking for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s amphitheater for 300 years. Amphitheaters were used for weapons training and military parades, as well as fights with animals and gladiatorial combat. Archaeologists from the Museum of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> uncovered the eastern end of the amphitheater's stone walls during excavations going on since last July, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, the museum's excavations officer, in an interview with The Observer weekly. The Corporation of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which administers <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, gave the museum $ 176,000 to dig on the site next to the medieval Guildhall, where the corporation meets. An art gallery and an office building has been planned for the amphitheater's site. The Observer reported that the corporation will talk with the archaeologists and architects this week to discuss preservation of the uncovered amphitheater remains. A clash could develop if the corporation wants to rebury the site and proceed with the art gallery and offices, The Observer said. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was founded by the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION>, who called it Londinium. The Romans stayed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from A.D. 43 to 410. The excavators think the amphitheater was built between A.D. 70 and 140, during the heyday of Roman <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Corroded coins found on the site may help to date the ruin more exactly. The center of the amphitheater is under the open courtyard in front of Guildhall. Almost all the area where the seats and walls would have been is under Guildhall itself, the art gallery site and neighboring buildings. The excavators say the amphitheater was oval shaped, 100 yards from east to west and 80 yards north to south. That is small compared with Roman amphitheaters found in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but about the same size as four others in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ at <LOCATION> Cirencester </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chichester </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Silchester </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will halt its military operations in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> for 48 hours because it wants to persuade two Tamil women to give up a death fast, a senior Sri Lankan government official said Sunday. The women, <PERSON> Anamma </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nesamma </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadivel </PERSON>, have been fasting inside a Hindu temple in eastern <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> city for the past nine days and are reported to be in a serious condition. The women have threatened to commit suicide unless <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> declares a cease-fire and Tamil separatists agree to discuss a settlement in their five-year civil war with the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful rebel group, meanwhile, said it was prepared for `` unconditional talks'' with the Indian government. The Tamil statement, issued in the southern Indian city of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> and addressed to the fasting women, said `` We accept your appeal in toto and with immediate effect.'' There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government. The Sri Lankan government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the halt in Indian military operations in the east would go into effect at midnight Sunday. A spokeswoman of the Indian High Commission said she had no information on the cease-fire but added that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had scaled down operations since the beginning of February. More than 45,000 Indian peacekeeping troops are battling Tamil militants in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce an Indian-sponsored peace pact. The pact was signed last July to end the Tamil separatist war in the island nation but it has been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>. The peace accord grants some autonomy to Tamil-dominated areas in the northern and eastern provinces, but Tamil rebels want a separate nation. <PERSON> Jyotindra </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON>, the Indian High Commissioner, last week appealed to the Tamil women to give up their fast. He said they were being used and `` instigated'' by the rebels to pressure <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> had the habit of using old women to fight their battles. The Sri Lankan official said arrangements had been made by both governments to halt the offensive and save the lives of the women. He said that efforts also were underway to contact Tiger Leader <PERSON> Velupillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON> to persuade him to begin negotiations. `` His response is awaited. This is a joint Indo-Lankan move and it is part of the contacts both governments have been making with the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> on Sunday reiterated his general amnesty offer to both Tamil and Sinhalese extremists, who have opposed the peace accord. `` I am prepared to grant all terrorists amnesty provided they give up violence,'' he said at the opening ceremony of a pagoda at <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION>, 126 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The predominantly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people They say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and the army. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION>, intervened in the conflict largely under pressure from its own large Tamil minority.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Taiwanese rallied peacefully Sunday to mark the 41st anniversary of anti-government riots and a crackdown that left an estimated 20,000 dead. `` The Nationalist government owes an apology to relatives of tens of thousands of victims'' of the crackdown, said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-shing </PERSON>, a doctor and activitist who chaired the Peace Day Committee that planned the memorial. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> told 500 people at a church service in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> that the riots were `` painful history that can not be forgotten or covered.'' Similar church services were held in three other cities Demonstrators carried banners and listened to speeches by human rights activists to mark Feb. 28, 1947, when thousands of native Taiwanese rioted against the fledgling Nationalist government. Researchers estimate that 20,000 died when the government suppressed the riots. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> came under Nationalist administration at the end of World War II, when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> relinquished its 50-year rule of the island nation between the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> seas. The country is controlled by the remnants of the Nationalist government that fled mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing the civil war to the communists. Opposition lawmakers have urged the government to include the riots in school textbooks. In <LOCATION> Tainan </LOCATION>, 202 miles south of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, about 2,000 members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> staged a two-hour march, said party official <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-tang </PERSON> in a telephone interview. Protesters demanded official condolences to victims of the riots, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said. He said demonstrators would place more than 2,000 floating lanterns on a canals to commemorate the victims. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> criticized dissidents at a press conference Monday for using the 1947 riots to `` incite the public.'' He said it is `` against the principle of love to repeatedly make the tragedy an annual topic.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the first native Taiwanese to become president, urged the citizenry to leave the incident to historians and `` remove the dark shadows from your mind. Have confidence in your country.'' Experts, however, say the deep divisions are fading with time. `` The tension has subdued significantly, especially during the recent years when the government loosened its political controls,'' said <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-han </PERSON>, professor of history at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The government has lifted 38 years of martial law and a ban on new newspapers as part of its move toward democratic reforms. Last year, about 13,000 people rallied to mark the anniversary openly for the first time. Researchers say the 1947 rioting occurred after a group of Taiwanese demonstrated in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> to protest Nationalist agents who confiscated money and belongings of a woman selling untaxed cigarettes. The Nationalists fired on the crowd and killed a man in the incident. The shooting touched off a series of riots across the island and the subsequent response by the government.

<TEXT>
 For nine months, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has given the impression Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> removed himself from the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> spy case. But now it acknowledges he was briefed twice about the case and it says he never was excluded. In what chief department spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> called a correction, he said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is only excluded from the espionage case against the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer who recruited <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> counterterrorism analyst <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> as a spy. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is free to be briefed and even to make decisions in the still-open <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case to the extent that they do n't involve the case against Israeli Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aviem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s own lawyer, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, was unaware of that distinction as recently as last week even though it was <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s work for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> in separate cases that triggered the exclusion, known as a recusal The turnabout comes as a government source said independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is examining another <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recusal for clues about his motives in dealing with a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> oil pipeline proposal in 1985. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> last May to represent him in <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation of whether the attorney general and his attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, violated or conspired to violate a federal law barring bribes to foreign officials In May 1985, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was recused from all matters involving <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, but arranged for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to meet National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to promote the pipeline. Investigators say that examining that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recusal might help determine whether the attorney general was aiding <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s plan or, as <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> argues, directing it to the proper official. At the Office of Government Ethics last week, General Counsel <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> explained: `` If you're a federal official and you've hired a law firm to represent you, you should recuse yourself, that is, take no action in any matter involving that firm _ just as a matter of appearances even if you have no financial stake.'' For that reason, <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> advised <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> officials last May: `` I hereby recuse myself from participating in any matter before the department in which the law firm -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cassidy </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Larroca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> -RRB- represents any party or is otherwise involved.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported then that the recusal covered the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not dispute that. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was sentenced last year to life in prison for giving reams of secrets to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents. But Justice officials still pursued the case, in part, because <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> had fled to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and has not been brought to trial here. So there was surprise and consternation when the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Feb. 19: `` After being briefed on the case last month, ... <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ordered that the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case be kept officially open so investigators can pursue their inquiry.'' Asked by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last Monday for an explanation, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said, `` I have problems with that account because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is recused in <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> bucked the question to deputy chief spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>. Citing the same problem, <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> bucked it to <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION>, who was with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> until Wednesday. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said he'd never discussed <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> because `` I think he certainly has recused himself because I am representing <PERSON> Sella </PERSON>.'' Expressing surprise at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> account, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said, `` At the department, they have known all along that it has been very much up front that he is not involved in <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>.'' While <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> sought an answer, a senior department official, demanding anonymity, said Wednesday there was no problem because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was merely briefed and made no decisions. Some former department lawyers dispute that view. One, who once worked in the attorney general's office, said, `` A recusal has always meant a Chinese wall. You are not even kept up to date.'' A former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> career lawyer said that, to avoid making a decision by `` a wink or a nod,'' briefings were restricted to situations where the information was essential to decisions in other areas. But Friday afternoon, <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> provided an official explanation that did not claim an exception for briefings. He said the client lists regularly provided by <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s firm `` have not included the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case, and so the attorney general is not recused from <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>.'' `` The lists do include the <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> case, and the attorney general has been very careful to avoid taking any action in that case or in any other related case where his action might at all affect the <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> case.'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> kept the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case open. `` He did n't have to, because it has been open for some time. <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> acknowledged that last month and on one previously undisclosed occasion Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, head of the criminal division, had briefed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case `` without touching on <PERSON> Sella </PERSON>.'' Why the turnabout? `` We were confused about the <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> case,'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. `` It was an honest error.''

<HEAD>Gephardt Hopes TV Ads Will Provide Super Tuesday Boost</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> moves into Super Tuesday territory with an extraordinarily effective television advertising campaign that touched raw nerves and won last-minute support among voters in earlier Democratic presidential contests. While critics complain that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s populist image is an insider's affectation and his hard-hitting `` <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'' trade ad is based on bad numbers, there's little disagreement about the impact of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman's TV campaign. The forceful spots, created by political veterans <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrum </PERSON>, are credited with putting <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> over the top in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and enabling him to stop a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> slide that could have jostled him out of the second place finish he needed and got. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is the only candidate who struck a chord, and I suppose he struck it through his TV ads more than anything else,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor with a personal collection of 1,600 political video ads. `` He had a different message,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won his most recent victory. `` The economy is not good out here. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> related to a lot of people on that. He was talking to the working people.'' In the course of his campaign, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has used a biographical spot, folksy ads boosting the family farm, patriotic ads asking voters to restore <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s soul, trade ads promoting his hard-nosed views, testimonials from other politicians, and negative ads criticizing his Democratic rivals. Most of the spots are accompanying him South this week in preparation for the Super Tuesday contests on March 8, along with new commercials a campaign spokeswoman said she could not discuss. Some ads began over the weekend in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; others begin Monday in states including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Undecided voters flocked to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> during the last few days before the Feb. 23 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary, a development analysts are attributing largely to an aggressive TV campaign against <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The ad was called `` Belgian'' _ a reference to Belgian endive, which a naive <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used at the outset of his campaign as an example of how <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers could diversify their crops. A narrator in the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ad cites the endive recommendation, contrasts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' trade and farm positions unfavorably with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s, and calls the governor `` one of the biggest tax raisers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history.'' In a version designed for possible use in Super Tuesday states, the narrator concludes: `` Those are some of the reasons why Southerners are for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Pause, then, with dripping sarcasm, `` Belgian endive?'' `` People do n't really like negative advertising, but you'd have to say it works,'' said <PERSON> Mahan </PERSON>. `` Where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his mistake was in not responding back to him. He just let it sit there.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s main television weapon in the Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses was his controversial `` <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'' ad _ 30 seconds of soothing music taking the edge off a sharp message. `` Because of trade barriers, a $ 10,000 Chrysler K-car costs $ 48,000 in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> says as scenes from an auto assembly plant fill the screen. The clean-cut candidate appears onscreen in white shirt, tie and black overcoat to conclude his message. If the Koreans wo n't change their ways, he says, they'll be `` left asking themselves how many Americans are going to pay $ 48,000 for one of their Hyundais.'' Trade experts say the ad is erroneous. They also complain that it oversimplifies a very complicated issue, but that is precisely why it works. `` It's more in the realm of people's thinking,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a good example for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to use and it obviously worked here. As far as what the actual cost might be, in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that's irrelevant because the caucuses are over.'' One reason the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> ad and a hay-filled farming ad appeared to reap such dramatic results for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was that they built on the type of grass-roots organization impossible to recreate across the vast Super Tuesday landscape. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, for example, had worked <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> exhaustively for more than a year, spending hundreds of days there, meeting thousands of activists, shaking countless hands, spending innumerable hours on the telephone. He was no stranger by the time his ads went on television after Christmas. `` His TV spots would not have had an impact had it not been for his foundation out here,'' said <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>. `` It's only at the end that TV mattered and had any sort of impact at all.''

 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> ushered in his administration Sunday by promising to seek direct talks with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to unify this island, split between Turkish and <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> Cypriots for 14 years. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, leader of 500,000 Greek Cypriots, said shortly after taking the oath of office that he would pursue a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Oza </PERSON> `` as soon as possible.'' But <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> also cautioned that `` until we reach a just and viable settlement, the constant improvement of our defensive capability is of the higest priority ... so that we may be able to face the worst eventuality.'' After the ceremony, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, 56, a millionaire businessman won the presidency Feb. 21 as an independent with communist backing, announced the makeup of his 11-member <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> _ nine of whom are political newcomers. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said any solution to the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> crisis must include the withdrawal of an estimated 30,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 settlers on the northern third of the island. A settlement also would have to allow 200,000 Greek Cypriots to return to their northern homes and include international guarantees against foreign intervention, he said. `` The settlement we seek for the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem is defined by the relevant <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions ... and is a settlement that safeguards the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said in his inaugural address before the 50-seat House of Represenatives. The east Mediterranean island has been unofficially partitioned since <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> occupied its northern third in 1974. The Turkish invasion followed a coup by Greek Cypriots and <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> army officers supporting a union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> charged that 14 years after the invasion, `` <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is methodically Turkeyfying our -LRB- occupied -RRB- land while the occupation troops increase and are supplied with the latest type of armaments. `` The settlers from the mainland are also increasing, suppressing the Turkish Cypriots and altering the demographic composition of the population. `` We are faced by the worst calamity in our centuries-long history,'' he said. The Turkish Cypriot minority, which makes up 17 percent of the population of 650,000, proclaimed its own breakaway state in the Turkish-occupied north in 1983. The state only has been recognized by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for two years. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, refused to resume negotiations until <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> withdrew its troops and settlers. During the campaign, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said he would be flexible in negotiations, but maintained that the issue of troop withdrawal should be tackled first. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, composed only of Greek Cypriots since the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities split in 1963, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said `` it is sad that the representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community are absent. `` We hope to have the Turkish Cypriots among us again soon, so that in a democratic, free <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, we shall be able to build a better, peaceful tomorrow, for the good of the whole people of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, who built the largest business consulting firm in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said he supported a free enterprise economy. He also said <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> would remain a non-aligned nation.

<HEAD>Impeachment Process Traces Back To English System Of Removing
Cruel Kings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opens Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial Monday, it will embark on a course laid out in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as a way to remove cruel kings and brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in Colonial days as a way to protect democracy. But despite the long and sometimes colorful history of impeachment, legal scholars say the seldom-used laws are ill defined. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> lawmakers grappling with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s fate have to make up many rules as they go along. `` The Arizona Constitution provides few standards or procedures for how the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is to perform its role,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Glennon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached Feb. 5 by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on allegations of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from a special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat involving a state official. The impeachment amounts to an indictment, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> process to a trial. The 30 senators will act as both judge and jury for the embattled <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor. But an impeachment trial is not a criminal trial _ it's purely part of the political system. The only penalty the governor faces is removal from office. `` It's basically _ ` You're fired,''' <PERSON> Glennon </PERSON> said. `` Impeachment is a way to get out of office those officials that violate the public trust.'' Even before <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial begins, political arguments arising from the legal vagueness have abounded in the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. While setting the rules, the senators have agreed, for example, that the evidence against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> must be `` clear and convincing'' in order to find him guilty. That's not as rigid as the requirement in criminal trials that guilt be `` beyond a reasonable doubt,'' but it is tougher than the civil standard of a `` preponderance of the evidence'' _ more than half _ for a verdict. `` There is nothing in the constitution about that and the senators can do whatever they want,'' <PERSON> Glennon </PERSON> said. `` It's typical of the constitution to leave things so open. ` Due process' and ` equal protection' are very vague words but we have thousands and thousands of cases that define what they mean. In impeachment, we have so few cases, it's not always clear,'' he said. Senators are constitutionally required `` to do justice according to law and evidence.'' Even the definition of an impeachable offense has been argued through history. Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, whose Watergate activities were probed by an impeachment committee in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, argued that a misdeed had to be dastardly enough to deserve a criminal indictment to be impeachable. But that's not necessarily true, <PERSON> Glennon </PERSON> said. Impeachment does n't have to involve illegal activities _ only `` high crimes, misdemeanors, or malfeasance'' in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. No court in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has specifically defined high crimes and misdemeanors regarding impeachment, but the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has said malfeasance occurs if an elected official commits `` an act which is either positively wrong or unlawful,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. The trial may look to observers like a criminal trial, but all 30 senators will have a chance to question witnesses, much like a congressional hearing. A two-thirds vote _ 20 senators _ is required to convict the governor. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the chief justice, will sit as a referee and be called the `` presiding officer.'' Five members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, through their attorneys, will sit as the `` Board of Managers'' and handle the prosecution. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will have his own defense attorneys. And there wo n't be any attempt to have an impartial jury. `` It is quite clear that the framers of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution -LRB- from which the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law is drawn -RRB- chose to make the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as judge and jury,'' <PERSON> Glennon </PERSON> said. `` The governor has no right to 12 ignorant lay people in this deal. In impeachment, there is no intent to have an impartial jury. The framers thought the fact that the senators would know something about the case was good.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also has been indicted in state district court on six felony counts involving the $ 350,000 loan, which amounted to about a third of his campaign war chest, and faces a criminal trial March 22. He faces a recall election May 17. He is the 16th governor to be impeached in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history; six have been convicted and removed from office. He is the first <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor to be impeached. If convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would be succeeded by Secretary of State <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat who is acting governor pending the impeachment trial's outcome.

<TEXT>
 A young man whose body was used for a medical experiment while he was in a deep coma died on Sunday, family members said. The revelation last Tuesday that an anesthesiologist had performed an experiment on <PERSON> Pacal </PERSON> <PERSON> Louette </PERSON>, 24, considered at the time clinically dead, touched off a scandal about the ethics of using human beings as guinea pigs. <PERSON> Louette </PERSON>, injured in an auto accident earlier this year, died Sunday morning at <LOCATION> Amiens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, his father-in-law, <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Collard </PERSON>, said. It was not immediately known whether there was a link between the death and the experiment in which Dr. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Amiens </LOCATION> placed <PERSON> Louette </PERSON> on a sabotaged medical device. <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> was trying to see if the effects would match those of a similar case which has resulted in a trial of three doctors. Last Wednesday, Health Minister <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzach </PERSON> suspended <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital center. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> condemned such medical exercises, saying neither scientific progress nor the search for truth could justify them. <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> had told his superiors about the experiment, which he videotaped. It was the second time <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> said he had used a comatose human being for an experiment. In 1985, he experimented on a 20-year-old comatose man in a chronic vegetative state, setting off a scandal. That person also died, but no link was established between the experiment and the death. At the time, <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> called such patients `` almost perfect human models, who constitute intermediaries between animal and man.'' The latest experiment was made public in testimony Tuesday by Dr. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassner </PERSON>, a medical expert at a trial in the town of <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION> where three doctors are charged in connection with the 1984 death of a 33-year-old woman. The woman, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Berneron </PERSON>, died after the removal of a tumor. She apparently had received nitrogen oxide instead of oxygen during resuscitation. A report showed that the tubes of the resuscitation system had been switched. <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> had informed <PERSON> Lassner </PERSON> of his experiment but has refused all comment since the court testimony.

 <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> borrowed a truck to take her husband's body to the crematory after he shot himself in 1981. In the early hours of the morning, she could think clearly enough only to know she did n't have the money to pay a funeral home. His ashes are buried in the garden behind their country home, the spot marked by a slab of granite on which she etched his name, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON>, with a pocket knife. She regrets only that she did n't share the intimate farewell with her husband's mother and the couple's children. Now <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> has written a book to help other people make their own funeral arrangements. She began writing it after her current husband, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, and his three brothers buried their mother in a pine box atop a ridge. `` It's very easy to understand why people give it away to a funeral home, and indeed, if I had had the money, I would have given away a very special opportunity,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said during a recent interview at her home. Her book, `` Caring for Your Own Dead,'' includes a directory of each state's laws on funeral arrangements, cremation and home burial, a glossary of terms and instructions on completing a death certificate. It also includes a listing of medical schools that accept body donations. `` I really tried to take the mystery out of body disposition,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. Many states allow funerals to be handled privately, but <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said there may be obstacles to obtaining needed information on short notice, including some funeral directors reluctant to offer prices over the telephone and local officials unaccustomed to the idea. She credits many in the funeral industry for their help during her nine months of researching the book. She found that anyone in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> can do a home burial as long as technical requirements involving the death certificate are met. If the burial is to be on private property it must be away from power lines and water and may be subject to local zoning restrictions. The town clerk keeps a map of private burial plots. According to <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a cremation could cost as little as $ 130, including a permit. Transportation and a box would add to the cost. `` The professional services and cost of the casket are two of the major expenses,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. In 1987, the average cost of a funeral, including professional services and a casket, was $ 2,935, according to an industry newsletter, Funeral Service Insider. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> took on her husband's funeral first from financial necessity. But then she realized that `` not only was it all right, it became clear to me that I needed to do it.'' One funeral director whom she had interviewed for the book called her after his 7-year-old son died. `` He did n't realize until afterwards how important it was for him to be involved personally,'' she said. Most states do not limit the family in caring for their dead, but some prohibit home burial and limit the scattering of ashes, her book says. About 80 percent of the 500 crematories <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> contacted across the country will accept a body from someone other than a funeral director. No state requires a body to be embalmed in every case, but many require it if a person died of a contagious disease, the book says. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a body may not be closed after an autopsy. In most of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, burial must be in an established cemetery. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> has no state licensing requirements for funeral directors, so anyone may handle a funeral. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s book, there are limits on private funerals and home burial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Other states where the family's involvement in funeral arrangements may be limited are <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, she says.

 Presidential candidates from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> work in a system where it's hard to avoid some flip-flopping on issues but when a candidate ca n't offer convincing explanations, those charges take root with voters, experts say. Two Democratic candidates battling for Super Tuesday votes, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, have been the most frequent targets, even trading those accusations themselves. Both, as legislators, have voted on two sides of several issues. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has taken fire for moving to the left after deciding to run for president, on abortion, trade and social issues. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has become more conservative, especially on defense matters. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, said, `` There are a lot of reasons to vote differently at different times.'' Legislative strategy means `` sometimes you've got to hold your nose'' and vote, he said. But that does n't mean voters should dismiss flip-flops lightly, he said, and the candidates should provide substantial reasons. `` The most damaging thing to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is his response to why he voted for the -LRB- 1981 -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tax cut'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, who studies <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and politics at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. During his campaign, `` first he said he fought it,'' voting for it only after a Democratic alternative failed, `` then he said he was proud of it,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stumbled when he recently tried to deny voting for an anti-abortion amendment. Then, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, the question becomes `` whether he remembers his record right, and if he's falsifying his record. Few members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can keep their voting records pure. Often several issues are packaged together with neither side getting a clear victory. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled this week to consider a compromise bill. Liberals might support it because of its general broadening of legal protections for women and minorities, but to do so they've got to swallow an anti-abortion provision. `` To take an individual vote and say that that means somebody stood for this or stood for that sometimes takes a lot of stretching,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't pay a whole lot of attention to the individual charges being made, not as much as to the defense being made,'' he said. Liberal and conservative groups who release annual studies of congressional records carefully select votes they believe show the true stance of a politician. Sometimes, the tallies are on procedural motions or other technicalities obscure to voters. Only a handful of lawmakers get 100 percent ratings from either the conservative or liberal groups. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, national director of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal organization, said his group's ratings can help voters look at the bigger picture rather than individual votes. On single issues, voters should be most aware of when candidates abandon long-held positions, he said. `` I would define a flip-flop as when a person had a consistent position for a number of years ... then recently, for whatever reasons not explained, there has been a change in attitude,'' he said. It might be unfair, for example, to say Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flip-flopped because six years he praised ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and now he supports the new government. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was a consistent abortion opponent until he started to run for president and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> consistently opposed military aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Now they have changed their positions and `` I think it is legitimate to ask, ` Tell us what the change process was,''' he said. `` I do n't want my president locked into an ideology,'' he said. `` But I think it's legitimate to ask them what were the reasons why.'' Voters are willing to accept changes in position if they believe they are sincere, he said. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was on the board of <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION> forty years ago _ you want to talk about flip-flopping,'' <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Canavan </PERSON>, director of the voter education project of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization avoids releasing voting-record scorecards on the politically explosive issues surrounding Social Security. `` There are so many other things, such as committee activities, putting together legislation, which do n't show up'' with a vote tally, he said. The organization also questions whether an objective scorecard can be produced, Candidates, meanwhile, do n't always see the inconsistencies in their own positions. `` Politicians do n't lie,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` They just have an infinite capacity for self-delusion.''

<HEAD>Cigarette Suit Evidence Has A Common Thread: Lawyers Usually Cast
Shadows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 During the first month of a cigarette liability trial, anti-tobacco attorneys have introduced stacks of documents and presented 10 witnesses. Through much of the evidence runs a common thread: lawyers and more lawyers. Attorneys for the plaintiff argue that cigarette company attorneys kept a keen eye on smoking and health research, helped shape corporate policy and vetoed putting safer smokes on the market. One reason, according to the plaintiff's theory, is because the companies felt that if they acknowledged the dangers of smoking _ either through public statements or marketing of a less dangerous product _ they would be open to lawsuits over existing cigarettes. The trial of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, makers of the brands that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked for 40 years before she died of lung cancer at the age of 58 in 1984, enters its second month Monday. Her husband, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, is pursuing a suit she filed before she died and is asking for unspecified damages. Attorneys for the tobacco companies say legal concerns did not dictate research. `` Lawyers are involved in decisions of industry all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, an attorney for the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, of firm <ORGANIZATION> Shook </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hardy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Bacon </LOCATION>, which represents <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>. He said lawyers need to be familiar with research and scientific developments because of the rising tide of lawsuits against the cigarette-makers since the early 1950s and to advise clients on advertising and testimony before public bodies. The evidence so far has addressed three of the plaintiffs' allegations _ that the defendants knew how to make a safer cigarette but did n't; knew of potential health hazards from the 1920s through 1940s but did not act enough on the knowledge and failed to tell consumers; and sought to suppress or shape in their favor research on the hazards of smoking The jury has heard the testimony of former in-house and external researchers, top corporate executives and an expert on smoking and health. Testimony during most of last week was from <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullman </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman emeritus and former president of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, representing the <LOCATION> Cipollone </LOCATION> estate, asked <PERSON> Cullman </PERSON>, for example, if the company's general counsel `` advised'' him on cigarette smoking and health issues. `` He would n't advise,'' <PERSON> Cullman </PERSON> said. `` He would monitor them, I'd say.'' Several confidential documents introduced into evidence Thursday appear to indicate the role of lawyers. A letter dated April 29, 1974, from the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> to an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, describes a committee of manufacturers formed to study industry-funded research programs. The council itself was funded by tobacco companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> executive named the committee's chairman as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, the named partner in the Shook, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> firm handling the current trial. A July 3, 1974, memo to committee members from another Shook, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> attorney speaks of `` gaps in knowledge'' in the smoking-health field. Included is mention of a paper by tobacco council lawyer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> with a section described as `` a summarization and slight updating of research recommendations.'' Before <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> assumed control of the manufacturers' research study committee, he corresponded with a tobacco council scientist, another memo showed. A Dec. 24, 1969, letter indicates the researcher, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Furst </PERSON>, had discussed with <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> the work of a British cancer researcher. Furst recommended to <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> that the British researcher, H.J. <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON>, a psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Bethlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Maudsley </LOCATION> hospitals in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, be given money for a pilot project. The letter said <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> had a theory that `` there may be a relationship between the appearance of cancer for some people and their emotional make up.'' Twelve years later, <PERSON> Eysenck </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> to ask for more research council funding, although it is unclear from the letter, also introduced last week, what the project involved.

 President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> has hinted that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> may be able to help free kidnapped Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Sunday. The official, who spoke in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> told Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during his visit to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Saturday that he had `` some ideas'' about <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' case. The official said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> talked about the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but declined to elaborate. `` We ca n't get into it,'' he said when pressed for details. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, headed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer team attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped Feb. 17 while returning to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> from the port city of Tyre. The kidnapping brought to 25 the number of foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction calling itself the `` Oppressed on Earth'' claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction and said he was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the accusation. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a senior militia official said Sunday that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnapping has imperiled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiite Moslem sect `` This is the first abduction that has brought the sect's two giants close to a head-on collision,'' said <PERSON> Abdul-Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, chief political officer of Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The Syrian-allied Amal has been at loggerheads with the Iranian-backed extremist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, for several years, but the kidnapping has increased tensions. Amal has viewed the abduction as a challenge to its dominance in the Tyre region and has vowed to leave no stone unturned in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to rescue the combat-decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> praised the abduction and called <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> a `` filthy American.'' <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> told reporters in Tyre that the abduction was `` more of a peril to the Shiite community than to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It has been threatening to kindle an intercommunal strife.'' <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said an unidentified third party was currently engaged in a mediation effort to ensure <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' release and head off an Amal-Hezbollah clash. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, Information Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had assured <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> of its continued efforts to gain <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' release. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s policy is to work with friendly organizations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in particular the Amal militia, to obtain the release of the one-time aide to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> for help in securing <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' release. Syrian officials noted with irony <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request and the recent parade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Just two years ago the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of terrorism, brought its ambassador home and slapped sanctions against it. <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said he believed the turnabout came when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> realized that no <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement was possible without <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Last October, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

Last year <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> closed the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> office of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist mastermind <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Banna </PERSON>, split from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1970s.

 Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is looking into borrowing money for extensive TV ads in the Super Tuesday states critical to his presidential campaign, but a spokesman said Sunday he has taken no loans yet. `` We've been exploring options about borrowing money because we want to have a comprehensive media buy,'' said press spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator is running a son-of-the-South campaign and has vowed to spend more than any rival campaign on the Super Tuesday primaries. But campaign finance reports through January show <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was well behind rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in spending. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> began running his commercials three weeks ago on cable TV nationwide and on local TV in the 14 southern Super Tuesday states, and a new series of ads begins Tuesday, <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said. `` To date no loans have been taken,'' he said, but added that, `` Our finance people have talked to banks,'' to line up the possibilities. Aftern ending January, with $ 2 million in the bank, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has boosted that to more than $ 3 million through fund-raisers and mail, <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said. Campaign finance reports show that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as of Jan. 31 had spent more in 13 of the 20 Super Tuesday states than any Democrat in the race, and close to $ 1 million in all the Super Tuesday states. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had $ 4 million in the bank at the end of January and his campaign says he is now raising $ 20,000 a day. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was a distant second, spending only $ 287,542 by the end of January. That was less even than the $ 345,280 spent by his cash-poor Democratic rival Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who has now decided to sit out Super Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> reported spending $ 482,697 on Super Tuesday states through January. The figures are from the latest financial disclosure statements the candidates filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, covering the period through Jan. 31. On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had husbanded his ample resources while rivals Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> both swept past him in laying groundwork for Super Tuesday. Most of the campaigns, with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> the notable exception, turned their attention to Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> contest and Feb. 16 primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, then directed their resources to the Super Tuesday states in the latter part of this month. Figures for February have not yet been released. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former TV evangelist, spent more than anyone in early Super Tuesday efforts. His total of $ 3.2 million included $ 1.1 million in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which was the biggest allocation reported by any of the campaigns for a single state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on the other hand, spent $ 335,743 in his adoptive home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and $ 1.7 overall in the Super Tuesday states; and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> reported $ 81,645 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> expenditures and $ 2 million overall. Aside from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was putting most of his money, $ 416,449, into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as of Jan. 31. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had spent $ 150,744 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> $ 617,933. Super Tuesday spending could spell strategy problems for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> because as of the end of January he had already spent $ 17.6 million against the $ 23 million overall ceiling imposed on candidates who receive federal matching funds. The other <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, whose campaign has rowed through turbulent financial waters, reported spending of $ 11,312 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 8,529 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and $ 819,311 overall. However, $ 723,027 of his money was allocated to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where several campaigns bought heavily on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> TV stations because that market includes viewers in neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said last week that the campaign does not anticipate any new loans, after borrowing heavily against his federal matching funds last year and in January. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> planned to run TV ads in seven Super Tuesday states. The Democrats have raised and spent less money overall than the Republicans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic leader, had put most of his resources into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 301,829; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, $ 206,861; and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, $ 146,582. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had spent $ 482,697 on the March 8 contests, but most of that, $ 316,822, was devoted to his home state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, which his opponents are virtually ignoring. His spokeswoman, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, said Sunday that the campaign goal was to spend $ 2 million on super Tuesday. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has targeted six Super Tuesday states for TV _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ and will buy in selected markets in other states, she said. The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign, which ended January in debt, is `` spending money as fast as it comes in,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. As of Jan. 31, his biggest Super Tuesday state outside <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he spent $ 69,809. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s biggest spending was also in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 74,921. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who last week announced he would skip Super Tuesday but stay in the race for later contests, had devoted most of his $ 345,280 in Super Tuesday spending to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where he spent $ 153,582. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had spent less than $ 10,000 in just three Super Tuesday states, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is expected to run strongly across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where 14 states are among the Super Tuesday battles. He has raised considerably less money than his competitors, but his campaign concentrates on the free media that he engenders by virture of his international personality status and his ability to draw large crowds virtually everywhere he goes. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the former senator from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, had spent $ 37,814 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as of Jan. 31, and just $ 12,000 in five other Super Tuesday states.

<TEXT>
 Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other religious leaders called Sunday for a sweeping campaign of defiance against new restrictions on opposition groups. Prominent clergy told their congregations that the church would become more active in opposing apartheid now that the government has banned political activity by 18 opposition groups. They called for a church-led campaign against the latest crackdown. `` We have no option but to engage in activities that now are prohibited,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Council of Churches. `` No matter what the consequences, we will continue to seek the unbanning of democratic organizations and the transfer of power from the white minority to all the people,'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> told about 200 people at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The government on Wednesday banned the 18 black-led groups from political activity and placed restrictions on the activities of 18 senior black leaders. Church groups were n't included in the crackdown and theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns, but most forms of peaceful protest still are banned under existing regulations. The outlawing of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups, most of them affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, is viewed as a clear sign that the government intends to maintain a hard line against all political opponents. Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, a prominent white minister and anti-apartheid activist, compared the crackdown with the government's 1960 decision to outlaw the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group and the 1977 banning of 18 black political organizations. `` To do a third time what has failed twice is rank stupidity,'' <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> said at the Central Methodist service. `` What the government has done flies in the face of history, exhibits a moral bankruptcy and is a declaration of war on peace.'' In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he would defy government laws he considers unjust. `` Apartheid is evil, apartheid is immoral and apartheid is un-Christian,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told about 200 people at the <ORGANIZATION> Bonteheuwel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, described the South African government as `` illegitimate'' and suggested church leaders would initiate a civil disobedience campaign in coming days. None of the church leaders specified what activities they would engage in, but there are several ongoing resistance campaigns that were led by groups now restricted.

<HEAD>High Prices Lure Backyard Farmers As Sap Starts Flowing</HEAD>

 High maple syrup prices after two abysmal sugaring seasons have prompted more people to tap more trees as the sap starts running this year, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s agriculture chief says. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> syrup sells for as much as $ 43 a gallon, nearly double the price before back-to-back bad seasons. But demand has not lagged, said Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` What's really kept it up there is packaging in ever smaller packages. We talk about the price per gallon but nobody ever buys a gallon of syrup anymore,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in an interview last week. The 150,000 gallons of maple syrup sold annually in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, most of it in gift shops and country stores, comes in jugs as small as a pint or less, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. But not all of it comes from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` There's some new production coming out of the woodwork in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'' that is sold bulk to packagers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` But we have the aura _ a geographic chauvinism'' favoring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> maple syrup. State law ensures that `` if you call it <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> maple syrup, it has to be made in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> estimated there are 400 commercial maple syrup producers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and 1,000 `` backyard farm-type people.'' `` We will tap a lot more trees this year, as a result of high prices,'' he said. `` Sales of equipment and tubing indicate a lot more people are getting in this year.'' Sap runs when temperatures dip below freezing at night and rise to the 40s in the day _ conditions that began to occur in some places earlier this month. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> produced 100,000 gallons of syrup in its best year, 1984. But during the last two years, warm weather day and night predominated, and production was around 30 percent of normal. Technology is revolutionizing the sugaring industry, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. He estimated more than 80 percent of taps this year will feed into tubing that carries sap directly to evaporators and other processing equipment, rather than into buckets. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says higher syrup prices staying around for awhile, regardless of how good this season is. `` If we go in with cupboard bare, no carryover syrup from last season, prices will be substantially higher than previous years, even with a bumper crop.'' A co-owner of the state's largest syrup producer, <PERSON> Bascom </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Acworth </LOCATION>, said she was puzzled that demand has remained stable despite the price. `` I do n't buy maple syrup. I ca n't explain it,'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bascom </PERSON> said. `` We made less gallons at a higher price -LRB- last year -RRB- and we came out about the same.''

 The <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> has been ordered sealed and workers were being relocated to shopping centers and hotels following the discovery of extremely high levels of asbestos. <ORGANIZATION> Brevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON> ordered the closing Saturday after <ORGANIZATION> Asbestos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported asbestos levels as high as 3.642 fibers per cubic centimeter in the office of Judge <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goshorn </PERSON>. Levels were as high as 0.182 in hearing rooms used by <PERSON> Goshorn </PERSON> and Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said County Administrator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> consider levels of 0.2 to be unsafe and warrant evacuation. Acceptable levels normally fall below 0.1. `` 3.642 is absolutely alarming. The courthouse is not fit for human occupation without protection,'' said <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON>, who moved his office and staff to a courthouse annex last week after levels of 0.175 were reported in his office. `` <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION> said it's probably the worst reading they have ever encountered,'' he said. <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON>'s order prohibits anyone from removing any items, including civil and criminal files, and traffic, child support and land records stored in the courthouse, without going through a cleansing room. Violators will be held in contempt of court, said <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION> officials planned Sunday to test courthouse records for asbestos. Test results were expected Monday or Tuesday, she said. Meanwhile, officials tried to set up temporary quarters while a decision is made on what to do with the building.

<HEAD>Children Still Think Earth Is Flat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Never mind <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. Never mind the globes in classrooms everywhere. Never mind those pictures from space of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as a big blue marble. When you ask children in the early elementary grades what they really think, most believe what their eyes tell them: the Earth is flat. That, at least, is what <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> physicist, and astronomy teacher <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> say. The two, writing in `` Science and Children'' magazine, suggest that educators are living in a dream world if they assume young children understand the earth is round. `` Nearly 500 years ago, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> proved that the Earth was round. Today's students still do n't believe it,'' they write in the February issue of the science teachers' journal. They cite several studies done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> in the 1970s and early 1980s in which school children in the early grades consistently turned out to be flat-Earthers. `` One of the first scientific facts we announce to our children is that the Earth is round. That flat, flat ground we walk on, ride on and play on, stretching endless miles in perfect and reliable flatness, actually wraps around on itself to form a giant ball. Preposterous, yet a scientific fact,'' they said. But `` if we expect young children to believe this story, we're wrong.'' <PERSON> Lightman </PERSON>, a research physicist at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> and lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, director of Project STAR, a high school astronomy curriculum, recently asked 65 elementary teachers to predict how pupils would draw the earth. The teachers thought 65 percent of kindergarteners knew the Earth was round, 85 percent of the first-graders, 95 percent of the second graders and everyone in third grade. Actually, according to past studies, only 5 percent of second graders know the Earth is round, 40 percent of third graders, 55 percent of fourth graders and 75 percent of fifth graders. Even fourth graders who say the Earth is round often `` picture a flat part where people live in the interior of the ball,'' they said. `` Others draw the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as a giant pancake or as a curved sky covering a flat ground.'' The authors offer a solution for enlightening junior flat-Earthers. They recommend teachers buy a big latex weather balloon at an Army-Navy or surplus store and inflate it to 10 feet. While a child holds her cheek against the balloon and looks at its horizon, `` slowly move a toy ship across the surface of the balloon toward the child.'' As the ship comes over the horizon, it is revealed in parts, the top mast first, just as it would be in the ocean. But on the flat surface of a large table, the child sees the entire ship at once, no matter how far away it is. Demonstrating this experiment on the cover of `` Science and Children'' are <PERSON> Lightman </PERSON>'s own 7-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON>, and a classmate at <ORGANIZATION> Alcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lightman </PERSON> acknowledged in an interview that `` there are n't many flat-Earthers by the fifth or sixth grade.'' So why bother to disabuse them of the notion at an earlier age? `` It's never too early an age to begin appreciating that the world is not always as it seems,'' said <PERSON> Lightman </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Anti-government protesters Sunday exploded homemade bombs and set vehicles ablaze in the capital to protest Parliament elections. An opposition leader said three people were killed. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the blasts on `` government intruders'' and said that `` police took away the three bodies.'' There was no immediate confirmation from the police. After the explosions, helmeted riot police broke up crowds with tear gas shells and charged with bamboo staves. At least 10 people were injured, three critically, including local reporters and photographers, witnesses said. The violence began shortly after <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> and opposition leader <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> addressed separate rallies at the city's main square. The women have led a series of strikes and demonstrations since Nov. 10 to try to oust President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, the former army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982. Both women have pledged to boycott Thursday's parliamentary election and have called for a nationwide strike Wednesday and Thursday to discourage voting. They contend that fair elections can not be held while <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> remains in power. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and several minor opposition parties have put up candidates for the 300 elected seats of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, who has vowed not to resign, has ordered army troops deployed to allow balloting to be held. Officials say 300,000 soldiers and police will be on duty election day. But a big turnout is not expected. `` Honestly speaking, I do not even know the names of the candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from my constituency,'' said <PERSON> Rafiqul </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON>, a 45-year-old farmer in the village of <LOCATION> Konnapara </LOCATION>, 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. `` There is no campaigning by the candidates this time,'' he said. `` Even the people are not talking about it.'' More than 80 percent of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 105 million people live in rural areas. During recent visits to villages in the <LOCATION> Savar </LOCATION> district and neighboring <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>, the only signs of politicking were stray posters showing the plow symbol of <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the torch used by a grouping of small opposition parties. But a lack of interest does n't mean the campaign has been uneventful. Three candidates have been shot to death. In cities like <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital, and <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> in the south, homemade bombs have been thrown and other strong-arm tactics used to disrupt campaigning. In addition, the anti-Ershad campaign has led to at least 25 deaths and seriously damaged the already downtrodden economy of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, among the world's poorest nations. `` This election is not going to resolve the political and economic crisis confronting <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>,'' said a senior <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The election will only accelerate the process of bloody confrontation.'' On Sunday, about 5,000 people attended the opposition rallies, which ended peacefully. But then some protesters split away in groups of about 20 or 25 and rampaged through the downtown area, hurling bricks at shops and passing cars, witnesses said. The protesters set fire to at least 12 vehicles, some of them cars and jeeps belonging to the government, they added. Demonstrators also damaged and burned some makeshift camps set up by candidates for their campaign workers. A number of homemade bombs were thrown near the city square, and blasts were also heard around the <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus, a hotbed of anti-government protests. The rioters were dispersed by about 300 policemen, who were stoned near the campus. <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> repeated her appeal to the military and civilian administration to try to block `` the farcical polls'' called by <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. The military has been the driving force in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s politics In the country's 17-year history, every change in government has been by coup. After he seized power in 1982, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 58, was elected president in a 1986 vote that the opposition boycotted and contends was rigged.

 Casually dressed and moving easily on his artificial limb, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> greeted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activists at the core of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family's political base, a union hall in a heavily Irish-Catholic section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s first priority is winning re-election for his father to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But as to the inevitable questions about his own political future, he admitted Saturday he is getting `` good practical experience.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 26, resigned his position as head of Facing the <ORGANIZATION> Challenge </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group he founded in 1985 devoted to eliminating barriers for the physically and mentally disabled. As co-chairman of his father's fifth re-election campaign along with his sister <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spends all his working time at campaign headquarters or on the road across <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, meeting local supporters, drumming up new backers and fighting to get people excited about a race which to date has only one candidate. `` Whether my father draws a strong opponent or a weak opponent, it's still necessary for him to know what's going on in different communities and for my father to be able to tell people what he's done for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said When news of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s involvement in the campaign became known last fall, observers assumed the post amounted to a training ground for the younger <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to seek political office. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Saturday he has not decided whether to return to Facing the Challenge after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign concludes. And while he did n't rule out seeking office, he said he has no specific plans. `` If you're asking me, am I going to be involved and active in my community, the answer is yes,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I am always going to be active and concerned about issues. `` I do n't have any plans right now ... I'm concentrating on my father's re-election.'' But he added, `` It is good, practical experience.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> got some good, practical experience in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section Saturday where he attended a state Democratic party caucus at <LOCATION> Florian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, home of one of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s firefighters union locals Democrats of Irish descent formed the backbone of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s political base in the 1940s and the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family appears to have held onto that popularity. `` Anybody in the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family has his head on straight,'' said <PERSON> Camilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION>, who is gathering nomination signatures for the Senator's re-election campaign. Many of the roughly 100 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activists recognized <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> from his work for the disabled and greeted him warmly. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> lost his right leg above the knee to cancer in 1973. He has remained active in skiing, swimming and weight lifting. `` I'm lucky to be alive,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. His own return to a full and active life, he said, was all too exceptional. `` There are other people who do n't have the same opportunities.'' State Democratic party Chairman <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, also attending the caucus, said Democrats would welcome a campaign by the younger <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` He's been a great campaigner. He cares deeply about people,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. And as for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s political career, `` I have to assume he'll have the opportunity.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> II gained some attention before running for office by saying he was unsure of the ability of government to help people _ a position he modified after his election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. On that score, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he has no doubts. `` I am one who really believes that public service is an honorable profession. It's what my whole family has believed. I've had a couple of uncles who gave their lives for public service `` People who think they do n't have a say _ I really reject that. They can, whether in this hall or a parish, a homeless shelter,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to close a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> assembly plant and its admission that it might sell its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary are fueling worker anger and distrust as the two sides head into this summer's national contract talks. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s parts operations were grouped into the subsidiary last spring, but most of <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION>'s 28,000 workers have been with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> since it battled back from the brink of bankruptcy early in the decade, when they granted concessions to keep the company afloat. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers think the potential sale, now that the No. 3 carmaker is again earning billion-dollar profits, indicates they wo n't be able to trust the company in the contract negotiations. More than 1,000 workers vented their anger last week outside <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> headquarters, waving signs and shouting `` Strike! Strike!'' at an emotional rally led by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>. One sign read: `` Concessions In'79, The Shaft In'88.'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, who will lead negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, said he will give <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> locals permission to strike on a plant-by-plant basis, based on local disagreements but because of the Acustar issue. Workers also are threatening to stop participating with management on a variety of joint programs, like quality control. The Acustar controversy comes on top of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it will close its assembly plant at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, this year and idle 5,500 workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> acquired the plant last year when it bought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. State and local officials charged that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had promised to keep the plant running for five years. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s governor threatened to sue, and last week the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> went to court on its own in an attempt to keep the plant open. `` Many of these workers gave concessions and made considerable sacrifices to help the company make it,'' said <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON>, a labor and technology expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` They thought they were investing in their future, and <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> represents an uncertain future if it's sold. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> underestimated the strength of the reaction and the fact that it has spread beyond <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> workers and affected the entire company,'' he said. One of those workers is <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1435 at an Acustar machining plant in <LOCATION> Perrysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Yes, we will strike,'' he said at last week's rally. `` Whatever it takes to keep them from selling it. ... `` We're also going to shut down all -LRB- quality -RRB- meetings, anything that's joint with management and the union. We will not attend, none of them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said the company is still weighing the <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale. He said the workers' anger and their future under a new owner will be factors in the decision. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> views the bitter responses to the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closing and the backlash against the <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale as two separate issues rather than a snowballing deterioration in labor relations. There is also tension over <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing efforts to get more work out of fewer employees. `` What's irritating workers is not simply <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION>. That has served as a lightning rod for other issues,'' <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of pressure in Chrysler plants.'' Workers see another threat. With the sale, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> could become the first Big Three automaker to follow the Japanese model of treating parts and assembly workers as two distinct classes. If <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> is sold, its workers face lower wages and benefits and probably wo n't receive the job protections the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> won in the three-year contracts negotiated last fall with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has until Sept. 14, when its current three-year contract expires, to sell <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> and restructure itself as a Japanese-style maker that builds engines and transmissions, assembles vehicles and depends on outside suppliers for all other parts After the 70,000-worker contract expires, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> almost certainly will have to accept the pattern contract established at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> last fall that makes layoffs for reasons other than slow sales costly and difficult. The contract also discourages moving work to outside suppliers. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> successfully resisted attempts by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to establish separate pay and benefit scales for parts workers last fall and does n't want a precedent that would encourage them to try again in 1990. `` The stakes here go well beyond <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON> said. The pay of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers, who gave concessions from 1979 through 1983, returned to parity with workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in a 1984 contract that included a base-pay increase in 1987. Auto workers earn an average $ 12 - $ 15 an hour in wages and $ 8 - $ 10 an hour in

 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> throne, should continue to speak out on controversial issues, according to a public opinion poll published in The Mail on Sunday. The survey of 1,086 adults, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poll </ORGANIZATION>, said 56 percent of Britons believe their future king should speak out more and only 14 percent believe he should say less.

 Fourteen months afer he grasped his long-sought prize, the governorship of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> returns to the state Capitol from exile Monday for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial which could end his political life. In recent days, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has battled to stop the trial. He has said that his constitutional rights are being violated. He hired new lawyers who petitioned senators and the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to halt the proceedings. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would tolerate no delays, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it could not breach the separation of powers doctrine by interfering in a legislative matter. `` The people of this state should be as scared and frightened as all get-out,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, said at a weekend news conference. `` This is n't <PERSON> Ev </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s rights we're talking about. This is basic rights in the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' The conservative Republican governor renewed his vow that he would not take the easy way out and resign. `` My resignation would write a bad chapter in the history of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' he said as he stood before reporters in down home western garb: boots, blue jeans, a powder blue jacket, plaid shirt and a string tie with a huge silver and torquoise clasp. `` That would be giving in to the powers who have schemed and planned to put so much pressure on me that I would eventually resign,'' he said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> insisted he should be allowed to resolve a March 22 criminal trial before the impeachment trial and its publicity. `` As governor of the state, I ask nothing more than is accorded to any garden variety criminal,'' he said of the due process rights he demanded. `` I certainly do not think that as governor I should be accorded anything less.'' Some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> suspected that what <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> really wanted was to delay the impeachment trial until after his scheduled May 17 recall election, hoping for an outpouring of support from constituents who elected him on his fifth try for the office. But the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow any delay. `` We've got to get going. The people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> deserve a fair break and the fair break is that the trial moves forward,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. To convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, two-thirds of the senators must find that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> committed `` high crimes, misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.'' Upon conviction, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could bar him from ever holding public office again. Although <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is best known outside <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for a series of public gaffes and outrageous comments which offended many minority groups, he is not on trial for those acts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is charged with three misdeeds _ concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his car dealership and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, which impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> Feb. 5, detailed the allegations in 23 articles of impeachment, the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case. After his impeachment, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was required to step aside as governor pending outcome of the trial. However, he is still addressed as governor and draws his regular salary. He set up offices in suburban <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> in what he calls his `` government in exile.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is acting governor in his place. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, who will preside over the impeachment trial, has called it `` perhaps the most important proceeding in the history of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' `` Clearly these are volatile times,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps never in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> history have so many of our citizens had such fervent beliefs on a given subject. We should be thankful that our system of government is equipped to peacefully and fairly resolve such a volatile situation. It is up to all of us as citizens to let the system work.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met with two prominent Armenian writers in an unusual personal campaign to allay concerns of Armenians demanding annexation of land in a neighboring republic, two activists said Sunday. The writers, <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaputikyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zori </PERSON> <PERSON> Balayan </PERSON>, met with the Soviet leader on Friday, said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a Moscow-based dissident, and <PERSON> Hovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON>, an Armenian activist and editor of the underground journal, The Armenian Matter. They said the writers met Thursday with Politburo member and propaganda chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he'd take the matter under his personal control and see to it that it gets the proper attention,'' <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Kaputikyan </PERSON> as saying of the meeting with the Soviet leader. Vassilian spoke in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of the Armenian republic. The official media carried no report on the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meeting. It was the second time that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had become involved in the sensitive Armenian dispute, which erupted last week into street demonstrations that witnesses said involved thousands of protesters. On Friday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for `` civil maturity and restraint'' in an address read on Armenian television by a senior party official. In the address, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would review relations among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 nationalities. Until now, the 56-year-old leader had never injected himself into an ethnic dispute since becoming party general secretary in March 1985. He may have stepped in now as a defense of his policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness on social issues. <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said that organizers of last week's massive protests in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> announced Friday they would hold no more protests until March 26 so national authorities could have time to review the dispute. The unrest has focused on the Delaware-sized region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The region is inside the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, but Armenians want it to be annexed to their republic. More than 80 percent of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s 157,000 residents are Aremenian. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and central Soviet television on Saturday tried to calm the population and play down reports of ethnic trouble by taking up the theme of brotherhood. They carried interviews with ethnic Armenians and <PERSON> Azerbaidzhanis </PERSON> saying they live together in harmony and that it was important for everyone to return to their jobs. The media said some workers in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> even showed up voluntarily for work Sunday, their day off, to make up for time lost while they were away from their jobs demonstrating. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> and other witnesses said hundreds of thousands of Armenians took to the streets of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> last week to press their demands after the ruling Politburo rejected an annexation proposal. The decision to hold off on more protests apparently was a result of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address and of an Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decision to ask for a review of the dispute by national leaders. <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said about 150,000 demonstrators gathered Saturday on <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> streets to continue the protest, but he said the city was calm Sunday. Armenian activists have sent a lengthy report to the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> outlining why they believe <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said that during a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, he learned that ethnic Russians had been brought in to replace the mostly Armenian local militia force and that 28 planeloads of soldiers had been flown into the capital to help keep order. At one point last week, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said, workers at the state broadcasting authority, <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>, threatened to stop all transmissions unless soldiers were withdrawn from broadcast studios. The workers also demanded the right to broadcast reports on the demonstrations. Within a day, the soldiers were pulled out of the studios and reports on the demonstrations appeared on Armenian television, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said.

 Cream pies flew, old flicks rolled and fans talked to to an old Three Stooges supporting actor when about 1,000 die-hard fans of the celebrated knuckleheads gathered for a weekend of _ nyuk, nyuk _ <LOCATION> Stoogemania </LOCATION>. `` I've loved <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> and Curly ever since I was 5 years old,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, 30, who came with two friends from <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. They and others swapped memorabilia, threw pies and watched such films as `` Three Little Pigskins,'' `` All the World's a Stooge,'' `` Dizzy Doctors'' and `` Disorder in the Court.'' `` I'd go anywhere there's a Three Stooges convention,'' said <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, `` as long as I do n't have to fly.'' Curly impersonator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> `` was involved in everything,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON>, one of the convention's organizers, said Sunday. `` When he showed up the place was just jammed.'' Knight, an iron worker from <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who bears a pate much like his cinematic hero's, tweaked ears and performed Curly's outrageous antics to the delight of fans who came from as far away as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for the two-day exercise in <LOCATION> Stoogery </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON> said nostalgia has sparked a resurgence of interest in an act famous for head-knocking, face-slapping, belly-butting slapstick, pratfalls and endless buffoonery. The original Three Stooges, created in the vaudeville days of the 1920s, were <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` Moe'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who later changed his last name to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>; his brother <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fineberg </PERSON>, a.k.a. Fine. By the early'30s, <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON> had left in a pay dispute and <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> `` Curly,'' another <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> brother, took over. The Stooges made more than 190 short films and about 50 feature-length films until the'60s, said <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> was the last Stooge to die, in 1975. In one room, Three Stooges postcards, T-shirts, belts, ceramic masks and hand puppets were displayed on tables. Also on display were books, publicity stills, movie posters and a canceled check from <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>. A Stooge trivia contest was in progress when the pie fight _ a highlight of the event _ broke out. `` I was emcee and I did n't even get a chance to close my eyes,'' said <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON>, 37, a firefighter from <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` I got four of'em.'' A telephone call was placed to <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitka </PERSON> and fans were allowed to chat with the man who played a host of older men's roles in more than 60 Stooge films. <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION>, who is in his 70s and now lives in <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was one of the few actors who played alongside <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON> as well as Curly, said <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON>, who claims one of the country's largest videocassette collections of Stooge flicks. <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON> quit because each of the Stooges was making $ 100 a week while their manager earned $ 2,000. The convention raised more than $ 4,000 by Sunday afternoon for cancer research, said <PERSON> Jerrier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugley </PERSON>, another organizer, said at least 1,000 fans showed up. In addition to footage from Stooge films, fans were treated to rare footage of Curly's wedding, <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> barbecuing, the Stooges in baseball uniforms in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> dugout in 1938, and on the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in 1939. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Likar </PERSON> said he's been a member of the national <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stooges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> since 1985. `` I got hooked 10 years ago, watching them on TV,'' said <PERSON> Likar </PERSON>, who flew in from <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The Stooges are great!

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s navy sank a boat carrying Palestinian guerrillas who were planning an attack against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, killing two Arabs on board, police said Sunday. An Israeli patrol intercepted the vessel off the southern <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port city of Tyre shortly after nightfall on Saturday, police said. Three of the five guerillas on board swam to safety and were captured, they said. Police said the squad belonged to the Libyan-backed Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. But Fatah, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream guerrilla faction, said the guerrillas were <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> members. Fatah sources in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said the squad had planned to attack the northern Israeli coastal town of <LOCATION> Nahariya </LOCATION> to avenge the killing of three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> two weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had blamed the Feb. 14 car bombing in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service, <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION>. The victims were identified as Col. <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayyali </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buheis </PERSON>. Police in Tyre who interrogated the surviving guerrillas quoted them as saying they belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by former Syrian army captain <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. The front claimed responsibility for a Dec. 26 attack on an army base in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by a guerrilla who flew a motorized hang-glider across the border from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Six Israeli soldiers were killed and eight wounded by hand grenades and gunfire before the attacking guerrilla was shot and killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported Sunday that Palestinian guerrilla organizations and anti-Israel Lebanese militia groups were developing small navies to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It said guerrillas receive their training in Arab countries and eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> navy carries out routine patrols off the Lebanese coast, frequently stopping and searching suspicious vessels. On Dec. 11, guerrillas of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, organization opened fire on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrol vessel, killing one soldier. The Israeli boat sank the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> craft, and four militiamen drowned. Three years ago, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> navy vessel sunk a ship carrying 28 guerrillas who the navy said were on their way to attack targets inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

But when details of the talks came out, Western <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies who had depended on a no-surprise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense and arms control style for 39 years wondered if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had forgotten to take their needs into consideration. `` We do n't think it's a fair accusation,'' said a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official. `` We've consulted with the allies assiduously before and after <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, but there's no denying the perception is there among Europeans that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> was willing to make drastic reductions in nuclear weapons, over their heads.'' `` The summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> will give them a bully pulpit to get their views across,'' said the official, one of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> summit planners who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. `` That's not to say we do n't want a summit; we think it's important to have this meeting at this juncture, for sound, alliance reasons,'' the official said `` It will let President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> show that despite some of the recent dents in his Teflon shield, he is an active and commanding presence. But on a scale of one to 100, the Europeans want it 60 or 70 and we want it 40 or 30.'' The Europeans' aim for the first <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit since 1982 is not just to remind <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of their interests as he heads for another meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the spring. It is to talk `` through him'' to whoever replaces <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as president next January and to set the stage for what is likely to be several years of alliance-wide agonizing over the future of its internal relationships and its dealings with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The leaders will gather at the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Wednesday and Thursday. The public will be barred from all but a brief opening and brief closing session and several hours have been devoted to meetings without large numbers of aides. At the end, the leaders will issue a declaration summarizing their goals and ideals for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s future. There also is talk of issuing a separate statement on conventional weapons. <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state, said Sunday that two summit issues would be: `` how do we stay strong so that we do n't make the world safe for conventional war or invite it'' and how to get the Soviets to reduce their now-stronger non-nuclear forces? The Europeans fear that with the possibility of a nuclear-free world, they may end up with no protection against the superior Soviet forces. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday,'' said, however, she believes the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance will always have `` a combination of conventional and nuclear deterrents. On an issue prompted partly by domestic budget pressure on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said the president will take <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> a message on `` burden-sharing,'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> jargon for dividing up the manpower and financial load of maintaining Western defenses. She did not say what the message would be but said, `` They can do more. We can do more.'' Any private understandings at the meeting will be transmitted to lower-level groups that have been working for months to provide answers to some of the questions posed by a new climate of East-West relations ushered in since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s accession. The leaders are less likely to dwell on the nuts and bolts of defense and arms control problems facing the alliance in the short run. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has already committed itself to a U.S.-Soviet plan to reduce long-range nuclear weaponry by 50 percent. Granted, there is still some haggling within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on the pace and scope of negotiations on short-range nuclear forces, chemical weapons and conventional forces. But the leaders are not expected to spend much time on these details, leaving those tasks to other officials and other forums. Nor is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expected to get into a general discussion of problems the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is having with some of the allies over the continuation of American base rights. Talks with those countries _ <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> _ are being handled elsewhere. Beyond the internal problems, perhaps hovering over them, is the broadest issue of all: the relevancy of the Western alliance at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is exhibiting signs of major reform and appears to be more forthcoming than ever in meeting <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> demands _ like one for a withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The alliance has stuck together for four decades out of fear of an expansionist and untrustworthy <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dominated by its military leaders. After nearly three years of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and no sign in letup in the ferment in his country and among some of his allies, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders are wondering how their alliance should respond. At their summit this week, `` I think it's going to be both a moment of looking at the success that the alliance has had and getting down to the hard issues ahead _ the analysis of the current situation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the opportunities it might present,'' one official said.

 The governing body of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> sidestepped a position on political instability in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, refusing in an extraordinary eight-hour session to chose between two men claiming to be the country's ambassador. `` In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, there are two presidents _ one who represents civilian authority and one who represents military power,'' Costa Rican OAS Ambassador <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent council Most of the speakers during the session, which ended at about midnight Saturday, voiced support for ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON> to represent <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, while military strong man <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON>, who has been the envoy. <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> protested that the discussion violated the organization's charter and said the permanent council was an inappropriate forum for an airing of his country's `` internal affairs.'' Over the course of the session, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors heard bitter recriminations about promises the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> failed to keep, allegations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks to destabilize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, invocation of the name of the late Panamanian strong man Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, and questions about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> reneging on its commitment in two 1979 treaties to completely transfer control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the turn of the century. Just for good measure, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who is now part of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s political opposition, had <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> technicians play a tape-recording of his telephone conversation earlier in the day with a distressed <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, wife of the deposed president In it, she told <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> what she had told military officers who came looking for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>: `` My husband is not here, nor are you going to find him.'' But the council failed to come to grips with the question of whether to recognize the portfolio of Leyton or <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>. Representatives of several non-OAS countries, seated in a section for official observers, gave <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> an ovation when he briefly entered the mahogany-walled council chamber and conferred with Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., who came as an observer But from the time the council meeting was supposed to start, at 4 p.m. EST, until shortly after 9 p.m., the action was away from the council chamber, as the roughly 30 ambassadors wrangled in private over whether to seat Leyton or <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>. A carnival atmosphere developed as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> alternately met with reporters in the ornate lobby of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> building, while musicians, waiters and waitresses prepared one floor above for a dinner-dance. At one point, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, shrugged his shoulders, and told a reporter, `` I'm supposed to be up there I'm the host for that thing.'' This was just moments before the formal debate began _ and just after a rumored deal to settle the credentialing problem had collapsed. A member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission, talking on grounds of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> council members had seriously discussed seating neither Leyton nor <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>. This official said they came close to giving the seat to <PERSON> Soraya </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, a career Panamanian diplomat. But <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Llanes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> permanent council, ruled that for purposes of the debate, <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> must be seated _ and he was. And that's when the fireworks began. `` The chairman feels it is important and necessary to have a representative of the sister republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> present,'' he said. Given the floor, <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> declared: `` A precedent is being set here because the representative of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> considers that the events taking place in my country are strictly matters of our own internal affairs.'' <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Villagran </PERSON>, countered with an assertion that `` we are faced with a historic decision. Will we be in favor of autocratic governments?'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we do or do not do ... could have a strong bearing on the decisions of other generals as they decide whether or not to let democracies survive,'' he said. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> took up for <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> debate could not be allowed `` to serve as a pretext for interventionist action.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> gave the debate its most riveting moments as he came to the table as a specially appointed representative of the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> vehemently opposed <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' seating, waving his arms to emphasize his points, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> reminded the Panamanian that `` it was here, where we condemned -LRB- former Nicaraguan strong man <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. He repressed the Nicaraguan people, and now the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> take away the right of self-determination.'' `` We are suffering a new phenomenon _ narco-militarism,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in attacking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` This narcotic-militarism knows no frontier. It is dedicated to the illicit trade that respects no borders, no boundaries.'' Two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of drug trafficking charges earlier this month. This was not the kind of government <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> envisioned when he joined President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in signing the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties in 1979, he said. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> took the opportunity to say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no intention of `` backing down'' on the treaty commitments _ as <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> had suggested. <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> persisted, nonetheless. `` We demand that the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> furnish proof of these allegations,'' he said. <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> directed his fire at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> because that country had requested the emergency OAS session. `` This forum is being used like a political circus,'' <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> screamed.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> finally made a little headway Sunday in his uphill fight to gain Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> support for negotiations on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement. `` They liked the package,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> outlined his proposal in a three-hour meeting with <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> then flew to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to resume his discussions with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> Sunday night over dinner and with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on Monday before flying to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> for a second round of talks with Jordanian officials. `` We have a package that is promising _ at least we think it is promising,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after seeing <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. `` Whether anyone else thinks it is promising is a question.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, standing alongside <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> under cloudy <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> skies, did not respond. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had endorsed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal. On Saturday, Syrian and <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials rejected the plan as unacceptable. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan, which he outlined for <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> on notepaper, calls for immediate negotiations to provide some self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The second stage would involve negotiations by December on an overall settlement of the decades-old Jewish-Arab dispute. `` What we are seeking is a comprehensive peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` That means we have to consider all the countries, security issues, the Palestinian people, their aspirations, their legitimate rights.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to the door and shook his hand, but did not emerge to face reporters and cameras. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s attraction to the plan could be based in part on the fact that <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> last month in talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pushed very hard for an overall settlement instead of an interim arrangement on the Palestinian issue. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s reference to a comprehensive agreement echoed the advice from the Egyptian leader. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> also has had a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for nine years and is in the midst of improving relations with its Jewish neighbor. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, on the other hand, has ducked and weaved for some 20 years on the issue of negotiating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He has held back until now because he can not be sure how much of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would be returned to his control. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> occupied the territory from 1949 to 1967, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the land in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, meanwhile, takes among the hardest lines towards <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the Arab world and has been reluctant to approve any U.S.-negotiated initiative. It also is a close ally of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is not inclined to give a major role in peace negotiations. Indeed, Syrian and <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials stressed Saturday after meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that they want the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to take part in negotiations for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> want the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> excluded and Soviet influence limited. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has named a delegation of Palestinians to meet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was not expected to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation. Fifteen Palestinians from the occupied territories of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> earlier rejected an invitation to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will return to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> on Monday to review again the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan with Crown <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>. But a final decision is unlikely, at least until <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sees <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The king has steered clear of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s shuttle, reportedly to have dental surgery. A <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` It's a very strong signal that he -LRB- <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> -RRB- does n't want to get involved. In the meantime, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` The chances are still good that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after attending the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Wednesday and Thursday.''

 While a charity was collecting money to help a man keep his electricity flowing, a city worker quietly went to the power company and paid the bill out of his own pocket. `` I went down there to take care of that thing ... and I found out it was paid,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who is unemployed, said Friday. He said he was told that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a deputy city marshal, had paid the bill Wednesday, the day after a newspaper described <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s problems. `` I thought -LRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -RRB- was in need and God has been good to me,'' said <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>. `` My heart always goes out to those in need,'' he said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s troubles included not only the $ 63.41 bill, which was 90 days overdue, but the need to keep his 4-month-old daughter on an electric heart monitor because of seizures and breathing problems. <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had threatened to cut off <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s electricity, had agreed to give <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> until Friday to pay the bill. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which helped him work out the delay, also collected money to pay the bill. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he would use the gifts to pay for food and medicine for his wife, 4-year-old son and his infant daughter.

 It's been compared with the colonies' fight to overthrow King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> It's the little guy against the establishment, the underdog fighting for a principle. And it's all about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which changed the name of <LOCATION> Clarks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, after the veteran Republican senator from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, without asking local residents what they thought of the idea. `` I think we should change the Constitution from ` We the people' to ` You the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They could tell us what we need and what to call everything down here,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Elswick </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bait </LOCATION> and Tackle in <LOCATION> Appling </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. Some cite an emotional attachment to the name taken from this nearby tiny town when the 70,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> lake was first filled 44 years ago. Others say they've built a business reputation on the name, bringing national fishing tournaments and speedboat races and investing in souvenirs. Others are upset about the way the name of the lake on the <LOCATION> Georgia-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> border was changed. Rep. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, introduced a bill suggesting the change on Dec. 3, two days before <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>'s 85th birthday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a similar measure on Dec. 4, and by Dec. 23, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had signed it into law. <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> said he was approached by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Clarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill-Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> about changing the lake's name The eight-member authority was created in 1946 to `` assist, promote and cooperate'' in the development of the <PERSON> Clarks </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> lakes on the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> said the board members, appointed by the governor, decided amongst themselves that naming the lake after <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> would be a good idea because of all he's done to support the area. He said they did n't seek any public opinion because `` we were not making the final decision. We had no control over <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' But when <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., introduced the measure for the name change in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the authority's unanimous support was entered into the Congressional `` It was our impression that the local folks in the area were supportive of the change ...,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittinghill </PERSON>. A number of businessmen around the lake have posted petitions asking for a compromise _ change the name of the lake back to <PERSON> Clarks </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and leave the dam and the road across it named after <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, whose name is already on schools, federal buildings and streets around the state. The petitions are being distributed by a group called `` Keep <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' led by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lincolnton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clarks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The two say they have more than 20,000 signatures so far, and they've taken out newspaper ads, gone on television and radio and are applying for status as a non-profit agency so they can accept donations for the fight. They realize the compromise also will take an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And they think that will require support from <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> has said he was deeply honored by the lake's new name, and he wo n't comment on the proposed compromise. He said he does n't consider the issue a serious problem and `` I do hope the controversy will subside. It's not the first time the lake's name has been changed. When it was first created, a typographical error caused the name to officially go down as `` <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>'' instead of `` <LOCATION> Clarks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>.'' It took 26 years before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restored the missing `` s.'' The person who sponsored that legislation was <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>.

 The piping plovers and roseate terns due to arrive in nesting areas here in the coming weeks will be met by thousands of gulls, renewing a battle blamed for the decline of the endangered birds off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. Thirty years ago, piping plovers and roseate terns outnumbered the gulls nesting on <LOCATION> Monomoy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> during the spring and summer. But last year just two pairs of piping plovers and seven pairs of roseate terns nested at the <LOCATION> Monomoy </LOCATION> wildlife refuge, fighting for survival against an estimated 70,000 gulls. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <LOCATION> Monomoy </LOCATION>, this month released a new master plan for the refuge that permits poisoning the gulls to protect the endangered birds. The gull population explosion has coincided with rampant residential development on the coast, where garbage in landfills has given the gulls a new food source. `` We're giving them a free, hot lunch every day and the terns and plovers just are n't adaptable enough to take advantage of that opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, director of the state's endangered species program `` They are competing for the same piece of land and the gulls are much more aggressive,'' French said. `` They will eat the terns for lunch.'' There will be no poisoning this year because the plan was released too late to conduct the necessary environmental study before the migrating shorebirds arrive from winter habitats in the South. But refuge manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillio </PERSON> believes the plan will be used next spring. `` I'm of the opinion that the gull population has expanded to the point where this seems to be the most viable technology to use,'' <PERSON> Fillio </PERSON> said in an interview last week. `` You could study the issue until the plovers and terns are gone.'' Animal rights activists have denounced the plan. But state and federal environmental officials say they reluctantly endorse it as a means of restoring balance to the habitat. Only one pair of herring gulls was spotted at <LOCATION> Monomoy </LOCATION> in 1961. More than 15,000 pairs have nested there since 1980. There were no black-backed gulls nesting at the refuge 25 years ago, but more than 5,000 pairs have made it their summer home in recent years. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahey </PERSON>, conservation director for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said provisions in the new master plan endorsing gull poisoning only as a last resort `` sound like a step in the right direction.'' Because poison can not be used this year, <PERSON> Fillio </PERSON> said refuge staffers will use wire mesh to fence off tern and plover nests and disrupt gull nests near areas the endangered birds's nests. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, a state ornithologist, said nature may have provided an alternative to poison. He said a new barrier island created last year when a winter storm cut through a huge sandbar off <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> has created what could be a gull-free home for terns and plovers. By breaking up gull nests established on the new island, the terns and plovers could prosper undisturbed if they settle there, <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said. If the new island helps protect the piping plovers and terns, it will be the second time in 50 years that nature helped the birds in their fight against man's influence. Many species of shorebirds, particularly piping plovers, were hunted almost to extinction in the latter part of the 19th century. Their populations began to recover after passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and then rebounded dramatically 20 years later when a 1938 hurricane reshaped the land and provided new nesting areas.

 Jewish settlers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers clashed with Palestinians in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, leaving two Arabs dead, the army said Sunday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said one settler was jailed. Israeli police released two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teachers jailed overnight after they were arrested while carrying posters listing the names of two slain Palestinians. Details of the Saturday clash in <PERSON> Abud </PERSON> were sketchy and the army said it was investigating to find out who fired the fatal shots in the village 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police interrogated three civilians in connection with the slayings and arrested one, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The man, from the nearby Neve Zuf Jewish settlement, was to appear before a judge on Monday, the radio said. The latest fatalities came as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> pitched his <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace plan, visiting <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s mission is aimed at opening Arab-Israeli peace talks and halting violence in the occupied lands. But 11 Arabs have died since <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived Thursday, and dozens more have been wounded. By <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> count, 74 Arabs have been killed since the unrest began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> sank a boat carrying five guerrillas who were en route to carry out an attack in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the military said. Lebanese police said two Palestinians belonging to a Syrian-backed guerrilla group were killed and the three others jumped overboard and were captured by the Israelis. In another development, a military spokesman said the army has arrested a soldier on suspicion of killing a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protester a month ago. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> quoted witnesses as saying the soldier caught a stone-throwing protester in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and shot him in the stomach. Three Arabs were killed Sunday in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when guerrillas attacked an outpost manned by pro-Israeli militiamen at <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yahoun </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military sources reported. They said four militiamen were wounded. According to two <PERSON> Abud </PERSON> residents who did not see Saturday's clash but said they learned of it from neighbors, about 15 military and civilian vehicles entered <PERSON> Abud </PERSON> in the evening. The two witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they heard gunshots and were told soldiers and civilians were shooting in the village of 3,000. One <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was shot in his house and the other outside, they said. Officials in the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> identified the victims as <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON>, 17, who was shot in the head; and his cousin <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON>, 22, who was shot in the stomach. An Arab source, who spoke with a relative of one victim, said villagers also blamed the settlers. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teachers were released on bail after spending a night in jail on suspicion of incitement, said their lawyer, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>. He said police freed the two, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, after they refused to sign a confession in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>. No charges were filed, but <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said police told them they were still under investigation. <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>, who teach at a Quaker-run school in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, carried felt-point pens and a poster with the names of two Palestinians killed in the violence, <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said. They were freed shortly after they were visited by a representative of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who said she spoke to her son following his release. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 24-member Cabinet debated the violence. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that Transportation Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON> proposed closing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to the media, but no decision was made. At <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Arik </PERSON>, villagers said six carloads of settlers entered the village Saturday night, smashed the windows in a van and several houses, stoned homes and fired guns into the air. Touring <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION> near a village where two Arabs were killed over the weekend, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> heard complaints from Arabs about beatings and shootings. `` Go to the village, and tell the people that if they will be quiet, we'll be quiet, too,'' he said. `` As long as there will be riots, residents will be hurt.''

<HEAD>Amy Hardin, Liver Transplant Recipient As Infant, Dies at 5</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAHOKIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, who underwent a liver transplant at the tender age of 11 months thanks to vigorous community fund-raising, has died at the age of 5. `` There will never be another one like her, not like my <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>,'' said her mother, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>. `` She's at peace now.'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> died at home Saturday. She would have turned 6 on June 1. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> was born with biliary atresia, in which the bile ducts malfunction and the liver becomes hard. She underwent surgery when she was 6 weeks old and again at 3 months, but the operations were unsuccessful. Doctors said her only chance for survival was a liver transplant. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s health became a cause for community residents, who rallied in late 1982 and early 1983 to raise more than $ 260,000 for the transplant. The rock group Kiss performed a benefit concert in 1983 at <LOCATION> Kiel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Auditorium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. That same year, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> received a letter of support from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` If it was n't for the community getting together, we would n't have had five years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said `` She was the joy of our life. She was very strong. She fought all the way to the end.'' The transplanted liver <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> received on May 10, 1983, began to fail around Thanksgiving, Mrs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. On Dec. 11, the family took <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, where the transplant had been performed. She returned home Jan. 16 after doctors said her chances for recovery were not good. `` She could n't stand it anymore,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. `` We made a promise that we would n't take her back to the hospital. We brought her home and the family took turns being with her.'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s transplant was termed a success, but her recovery was hampered by a series of setbacks caused by rejection of the new liver, viruses and side effects from medication. `` Doctors like to say that you are over the hump after five years, but one can never say never. There are just too many complications,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. Besides her parents, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> is survived by two brothers.

 <PERSON> Missi </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> says <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> saved her from a life of drugs, sin and barroom brawling through one of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministries. Now <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s fall has shattered her belief in a man she had thought incorruptible, but she said her faith in God is unchanged. `` I had this image built of him -LRB- <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> -RRB-. He could do no wrong,'' she said. `` Now I know differently. He can do wrong, he has done wrong, and he can do wrong again.'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s confession to an unspecified sin did n't sway her belief in God. `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not change me. He did not have the power to do so. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> changed me,'' she said. She was n't at church Sunday because she would have had to leave halfway through the service, but she did go to a service Wednesday. Usually, she said, about 1,500 people meet in the Crossfire building, which will hold about 5,000. `` This past Wednesday night it was packed. They had to pull out seats for people to sit in.'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 21, said she will continue to attend co-pastor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>'s services. But she does n't know what she will do when <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who reportedly paid a prostitute to pose nude for him and tried to cover up the scandal, returns to the pulpit. `` The Lord is the one who led me to the church,'' she said. `` If he wants to lead me away, I'm open for him to do so. But I'm not going to sway on my own opinion of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> to decide whether I go or stay. `` I really do feel like that speaks to most of the church. They're looking to God now because they've learned their lesson looking to a man.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> never saw <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> as anything more than human. `` He's a man, and all men make mistakes,'' said <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, who left his home state of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> last year to be closer to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and his ministry. `` I feel nothing but love in my heart for him and his family,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, 21. `` He is a man of integrity for being able to stand there and confess.'' The <PERSON> Sextons </PERSON> met about seven years ago at an Assembly of God youth group in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where they began watching <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> on television. They began donating to his ministry about four years ago, and first visited his <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> 15 months ago. `` I felt the Lord wanted us to relocate,'' said <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, 27. He got a job at the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Taft </LOCATION>. They moved last August to <LOCATION> Luling </LOCATION> and drive 90 minutes every Sunday to and from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s church in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said he was shocked by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s confession, but thinks it was a good thing. `` It needed to happen. I sense he was somewhat relieved, because he's going to get the help he needs.'' And he said the sin does n't change the good done by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministries, which feed thousands of children a day and provide medical care and other services to the poor `` No one will ever know how many lives it -LRB- ministry -RRB- has touched,'' he said. After Sunday's worship service during which <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> thanked the congregation for their support, <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Keel </PERSON> voiced faith in her troubled minister. `` I think <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s a great pastor and I think God will bring him out,'' she said. `` You see, God forgives us for everything we do. He has the advocate with the father. He's my brother in Christ.'' `` You have to forgive and forget,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>, another congregation member. `` You have to go on in the Lord.''

Prosecutors say they will conclude their presentation by July, but the defense is n't saying how long it may take. `` Sometimes it irks me when people talk about how long it's been,'' says defense attorney Dean Gits, one of the players in this long-running drama on the 15th floor of the downtown Criminal Courts Building `` This has to be put into perspective. The case is absolutely unique,'' he said last week. `` We are dealing with allegations that cover four to five years. Murders do n't take that long; it's a split second. Rapes and robberies do n't take that long. `` How do you reconstruct a period of time that happened many, many years ago and covers four to five years? If people do n't understand that then they do n't understand why it's taking so long. Gits represents <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, who is on trial along with her son, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 29, charged with 100 child molestations at their now defunct family owned preschool in suburban <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. With time, the case has changed. Five teachers originally charged had their cases dismissed for lack of evidence. The prosecution, which once involved 41 children, now focuses on 13 youngsters who have grown from toddlers to pre-teen-agers. And the children's sometimes bizarre stories of satan worship, animal mutilation and trips to remote places have all but vanished. `` I sense that they have weeded out those -LRB- children -RRB- who went into fantasyland,'' says Gits. The latest child witness, a slender, 11-year-old boy, took the stand last week, telling jurors in 15 minutes what he remembered of his alleged molestation by <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> and mentioning briefly that he once saw <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> kill a horse. In a now familiar pattern, the cross-examination by Gits and <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, extended for days as the lawyers tried to elicit details which the prosecution never sought. Details of the horse incident, for example, were almost impossible to extract from the young witness who repeatedly answered, `` I do n't know.'' But the boy, nervous and embarrassed, told of being fondled and forced into oral copulation by <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> and said he felt `` sick and dirty'' when he drew pictures of the incident for his mother. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says he sees a pattern of fading memories. But Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who has guided the case almost from its inception, says the child witnesses have improved with age. `` The children are more articulate. Their memories may not be as detailed as several years ago, but they're older, more articulate and less intimidated,'' she says. So far the jurors, who have sworn to stick with the trial no matter how long it lasts, have heard from only five of the children. Other prosecution witnesses called so far have included doctors, police officers and parents. `` The really important witnesses are the children themselves,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s co-counsel, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON>. `` And the children have testified very well.'' The trial's duration has had a personal impact on all participants. The jurors, initially restless, have settled into a routine, taking copious notes. Many of them carry lunchboxes as if they are going to work. `` They've become part of the case and the commitment is coming through,'' says Gits. <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> jogs and rides a bicycle to relieve tension. Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> found that they had enrolled in the same health club, and they often encounter each other working out in preparation for their courtroom battles. Gits shuns exercise, saying, `` When I want to relax I smoke a cigarette and drink a cup of coffee.'' The greatest strain is on the defendants. The gray-haired Mrs. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, free on bail, sits and knits during recesses, chats with courtroom spectators or thumbs through a small Bible. `` She has her faith and believes very much that <PERSON> God </PERSON> has helped carry her through this,'' says Gits. Her son, who has been jailed without bail for nearly five years, was granted $ 3 million bail just before Christmas. In spite of pledges of property, he has been unable to raise the necessary $ 300,000 in cash to gain release. But <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says his client is in `` pretty good spirits,'' sustained by the knowledge he will one day get to tell his side from the witness stand. Perhaps the most powerful figure in the courtroom is Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON>, who tries every day to move things along quickly. Last November, one year after he took over the <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> marked the date by declaring, `` I do n't intend to see another anniversary date. I intend to conclude the case within the next year.''

<TEXT>
 When a small fire broke out above the stage of the Marquis Theater, `` Me and My Girl'' star <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> kept cool, as did the full house of 1,600. Nobody was hurt in the incident, which interrupted Saturday's matinee about 15 minutes into the first act of the Tony-award-winning musical and sparked <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>'s sense of humor `` You've got to expect this if you come to see the hottest show on Broadway,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> told the playgoers after they filed back into the theater after a 40-minute interruption. An overheated cable ignited a piece of rope in the proscenium arch, out of view of the audience, said stage manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanni </PERSON>. `` There was a smell of smoke during the first scene, and after I made my exit, I said, ` Something's burning,''' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> recalled Sunday. `` Then I heard a commotion, and I thought, ` That's not in the scene, shouting and carrying on.' I looked out, and people were rushing out, up the aisles.'' One of the show's managers calmed the crowd, which filed out in an orderly fashion, <PERSON> Bonanni </PERSON> said. The fire was quickly extinguished by stagehands. After city firefighters made a safety check, the audience was let back in. A few jokes `` got them in a damn good mood,'' and then <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> recapped the play's action up to the point of the fire and retreated backstage. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, who plays a Cockney commoner who lands in the lap of English aristocracy, said he `` could n't resist an ad lib'' in a later scene. `` I say to the butler, ` You have n't got a cigarette, have you, mate?' Then I turned to the audience and said, ` I promise I wo n't light up,''' he said He thinks the incident cast a warm glow over the audience _ figuratively speaking. `` They love to be involved in something fresh and new,'' he said. `` We ca n't supply a fire every day, though.''

 A swarm of earthquakes shook the desert on both sides of the <LOCATION> California-Mexico </LOCATION> border but no damage or injuries were reported from the late-night tremors, authorities said Sunday. Six quakes measuring between 3.0 and 4.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale struck between 9 p.m. Saturday and midnight, clustered 19 miles southwest of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centro </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and 75 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> charged on Sunday that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condoned trading arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair, saying in a Republican presidential debate, `` We should n't do those things.'' In a key confrontation before the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries across the South, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> slammed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ the party's front-runners _ as two moderates who would raise taxes and end the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution. `` They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported every single tax increase over the last eight years,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` If they're nominated, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution is over, gone, dead.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> objected, saying they have fought against tax increases and for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's agenda for the past seven years. They fired back at <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for what they contend is his casual attitude toward the federal budget deficit. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s never met a deficit he did n't like,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, ` You do n't care about deficits. You never have, and they're public enemy No. 1.'' On the recent turmoil in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, both <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> warned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not tolerate instability near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. `` If we've learned anything from Iran-Contra, we ought to give -LRB- military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> 30 days to get out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or tell him we're going to have a trade embargo,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, adding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` de-recognize'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said, `` If the Panamanians want to keep <PERSON> Noregia </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to keep the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.'' It was the first debate with all four hopefuls since the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and it may be the last one for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not scheduled to do any more debates, including the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> confrontation next Sunday in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is following a `` front-runner's strategy'' by skipping the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried at one point in the debate to say Republicans should not be criticizing each other, but that did n't stop <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> from attacking the vice president for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair `` We never should trade arms for hostages. We should n't issue these reports and say we should n't trade arms for hostages _ the vice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and say it's all right. We should n't do those things,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, holding up a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not respond directly, but did say `` mistakes were made'' in the Iran-Contra affair. Asked later if the affair had occurred on `` his watch,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I think when the president found out what happened, he took the proper steps.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has maintained throughout the affair that he did not know the arrangement was an arms-for-hostage deal. Measures to protect the South's textile industry also caused sparks, with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> accusing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of changing their stands to please Southern voters. More than one-third of the Republican nominating delegates are at stake in contests across the South and elsewhere on March 8. `` <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> sound like <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to me on trade, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> say the budget deficit is public enemy No. 1. I want to say I belive the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is public enemy No. 1,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said after the debate. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> is the sponsor of a tough trade measure that would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against unfair practices by other countries. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had said in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, `` We'll raise exports of food and grain _ and then go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and say we're going to put up barriers to imports. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> retorted that he did n't want American jobs being lost to workers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with its Communist regime. There were also sharp exchanges on the question of how to reduce the federal deficit, although each denied that they would raise taxes as president. `` The problem is not revenues. It's spending,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We have a deficit because we have a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who spends too much money ... and interest rates are too high.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, outlining his ideas, said: `` I've proposed a four-year freeze that allows for inflation ... that gives the president flexibility.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> defended his own voting record, displaying a multi-page list of what he said were his votes against tax increases since 1975. He complained that some campaign ads distort his record on taxes _ a reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ads _ and then hit at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directly. `` I've been leading the efforts to reduce tax rates,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` You do n't go the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> route. It's a four-year cop-out ... We've got to reduce the deficit ... No one in this group is advocating raising taxes.'' Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fired back at <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s plan for a one-year spending freeze would hurt defense `` It will cut into the muscle on defense,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. And he defended his own four-year idea: `` I would n't call it a cop-out. It disciplines the spending side.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the problem is not one of economics. `` It's a question of will,'' he said, asking if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can make hard decision to cut spending. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has spent much of the past two weeks explaining various statements on missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the source of the expose of problems afflicting fellow TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, said the press is a big problem for candidates. `` I know it's very difficult dealing with the press of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to get the truth out. They love to distort our words,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` We are making it so difficult in our society for anyone to serve.'' The debate was sponsored by the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution newspapers, moderated by the papers' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> and televised live on the Cable News Network. The Democrats took part in a similar debate on Saturday. The newspapers sponsored a similar forum Saturday night for the six Democratic presidential candidates.

 Iranian warplanes, usually crippled by shortages of spare parts, bombed three key economic targets in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Sunday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> retaliated with air raids on two Iranian cities. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s state radio said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets bombed the cities of <LOCATION> Hamadan </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Dezful in the southeast in simultaneous raids at 9 p.m. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the attacks were in retaliation for `` recent atrocities and crimes committed by the charlatans of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not immediately confirm the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids. In a separate dispatch, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian artillery over the weekend shelled `` purely civilian targets'' in six Iraqi border towns and cities. It said said several people were killed or wounded but gave no casualty figures. An earlier communique said two women and a child were killed and several people, including four women, were wounded in Sunday's shelling It said seven civilians were killed and 16 wounded in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and al-Qurna on Saturday. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that Iranian warplanes bombed a petrochemical plant in the southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, oil installations in <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khassib </PERSON> and a bridge linking <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rassas </LOCATION> island, in the disputed <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway, with mainland <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The tiny island is a forward <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> position southeast of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on the southern sector of the front with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. All Iranian planes returned safely to base from the `` successful'' midmorning raids, said the communique, broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. An exchange of air raids that began Saturday have prompted fears that a new round of the `` war of the cities'' is beginning. Thousands of civilians have been killed in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during such attacks. Hostilities on population centers generally are preceded by accusations and warnings similar to those <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> exchanged this weekend. The Iranian air force was out of action for most of 1987. In January, Iranian warplanes resumed combat missions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, an indication that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had somehow acquired spare parts for its U.S.-built jets. Western military analysts say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has about 70 operational combat aircraft, including F-4 and F-5 fighter-bombers and F-14 interceptors. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, with more than 500 Soviet and French warplanes, has maintained air supremacy in the 7-year-old gulf war. The Iranian war communique said the raids Sunday were in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> strikes the day before on civilian targets in a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> suburb and in the town of <LOCATION> Saghez </LOCATION>, in the northwestern <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported 25 civilians killed and an unspecified number wounded in the Iraqi raids Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> denied <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> hit any civilians targets over the weekend. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force commander Air Marshal <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> also warned the Iranians against carrying out their threats. `` It is an illusion that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> believes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will succumb to threats of attacking the cities,'' <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> said in an interview with <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Ath-Thawra </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had drawn plans to `` strike at strategic Iranian targets and also at the nests, where the rotten heads are being sheltered.'' That was a reference to headquarters of Iranian leaders.

 A 77-year-old Soviet Jew who battled for 13 years to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> embraced his daughter when he arrived Sunday in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Some of us managed to get out _ many are still left behind,'' said mathematician <PERSON> Naum </PERSON> <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON>, referring to Soviet emigration policies. <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the same day as another leading Soviet Jewish activist, electrical engineer <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, who came here with his wife and two children. <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> hugged his daughter, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Plam </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, after she arrived at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> aboard a flight from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 14 years ago and had not seen her father since then. Soviet authorities said they delayed <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON>'s emigration request because of his `` access to state secrets.'' <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> had worked in classified mathematical calculations in 1955. <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> linked his release to the policy of glasnost _ greater political openness on some topics _ initiated by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` It is true that it's easier to breathe in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nowadays, after glasnost,'' he said. `` However, in essence nothing has changed.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> allowed 8,011 Jews to emigrate in 1987, up from less than a thousand annually in recent years but still far short of the more than 50,000 permitted to leave in 1979. <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> was met by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Weizman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Both institutions have offered the scientist opportunities to continue his work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> plans to settle. <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Friday and rested in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Saturday. His wife, <PERSON> Inna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitrosskaya </PERSON>, struggled for years for an exit visa for cancer treatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She received permission and left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, but died 15 days later of a stroke. <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> was not allowed to accompany his wife or to attend her funeral. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, was accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Leah </PERSON>, 38, his son <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON>, 13, and the 9-year-old daughter <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> family, which had been refused emigration permits for 11 years, gained international prominence when <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> wrote a letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying: `` You are known as a kind and good grandfather. Why do n't you let me meet my grandparents who live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>?'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French authorities also intervened on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Shapiros </ORGANIZATION>.

 Deposed president <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> stayed in hiding Sunday and defied Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the military strongman who ousted him and ordered him out of the country. The ex-president's whereabouts were a closely guarded secret, but family members said he was in a `` safe and secure place'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, in `` good spirits'' and determined to regain his job. `` I am going to stay here -LRB- and -RRB- stick it out,'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television in a telephone interview Saturday night. `` I'm going to fight it all the way.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> did not reveal his hiding place. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s vice president, also was in hiding. Both men were ousted from office early Friday in an action by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> orchestrated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> ignited the latest crisis in eight months of continuing civil unrest in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Thursday when he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is charged in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with corruption and narcotics trafficking. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has urged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as military chief. On Friday, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> returned to his home in an upper-class neighborhood. Police surrounded the house Friday evening and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s telephones were cut, leaving him incommunicado and under an undeclared house arrest. Sometime that night, he reportedly climbed over a patio wall at the rear of the house and escaped through a neighbor's yard, avoiding the policemen who had been posted on the street in front of his home. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a brother-in-law, and other family members said military officials had warned <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> that if he did n't leave the country voluntarily he would be arrested and forcibly deported. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was telephoning leaders throughout the world seeking their support. He said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was not with his wife and three children, but that all were safe. `` They are in one place and he is alone in another,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday some of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s children or grandchildren were at the American Embassy or the home of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment Sunday on that report. The Panamanian government claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were hiding <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> at an American military installation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Sunday he was `` under the protection of a good Panamanian family and they will never find him.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said she could not `` confirm or deny anything.'' She said the embassy was under orders from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` not to discuss the situation.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s hopes of regaining the presidency suffered a setback Saturday night when the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, declined to take any action on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had hoped the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> would agree to impose trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, or at least approve a resolution condemning the president's ouster by the military. On the eve of a planned nationwide protest strike, priests in Roman Catholic churches throughout the country read a communique to parishoners from Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. The communique, first issued two days ago, decried `` corruption -LRB- that has -RRB- spread throughout the public and private sectors'' of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and said the events of the past few days `` had deepened the crisis and damaged the credibility of the government and the constitutional process.'' But the archbishop urged his followers not to resort to violence in an attempt to resolve what he called `` the grave national and international problems'' facing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The strike was called by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor and political groups that has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since last June. Crusade leaders said they hoped to `` totally paralyze'' the country early this week, but there were indications the strike would not meet its goal. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, predicted Sunday that many store owners would open for business Monday `` out of fear of government repression.'' He said `` military people'' already had threatened some businessmen, telling them they would `` kick in their doors'' if they tried to close Monday. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was dismissed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in a tumultuous, 10-minute meeting Friday, about seven hours after he went on national television Thursday afternoon and announced he had fired <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s followers command a majority of 45 seats in the 67-member assembly. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s backers boycotted the session, leaving the outcome a foregone conclusion.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> got the highest rating from an environmental group Sunday, but no candidate in either party graded better than fair on the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Toxics Report Card.'' Six of the candidates _ all the Republicans and two Democrats _ got `` failing'' grades from the group made up of 10 environmental organizations from southern states that held a two-day conference in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The assembly graded <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a senator from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, at 76 percent on issues such as reducing use of toxic chemicals, cleaning up dumpsites and recycling waste. But according to the study released Sunday, that grade only rates as `` fair.'' None of the Democratic or Republican candidates scored in the `` good'' or `` excellent'' categories. Republican candidates scored much lower than Democrats, with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> getting the highest score at only 18 percent. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was next at 8 percent, followed by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 4 percent, and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 3 percent. Among Democrats, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> trailed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with a rating of 72 percent. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> were the only two candidates to appear at a forum Saturday before the assembly, which figured into their ratings. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was next at 64 percent, followed by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 60 percent; former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 50 percent; and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 47 percent. The assembly's report card said the grades were based on a candidate's `` past voting records, their written responses to our questions and their personal presentations'' to a toxic prevention conference. Ninety to 100 percent was considered `` excellent,'' 80-89 percent `` good,'' 70-79 percent `` fair,'' 60-69 percent `` poor,'' and below 59 percent `` failure.'' <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Frase </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enviromental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> member who attended the weekend conference, said the ratings show that the 1988 candidates are not addressing environmental issues. `` These candidates debate about many important issues, but they neglect to address the environment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Frase </PERSON> said. `` How can we focus on national defense when we ca n't defend our drinking water supplies against chemicals that cause birth defects and cancer?''

 A Welsh nationalist group claimed responsibility Sunday for four incendiary attacks on offices of real estate firms that have been selling vacation homes in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> to English people. Four offices in the English city of <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> near the Welsh border were damaged in the Saturday night attacks.

 A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet carrying 281 passengers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Sunday returned to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and made an emergency landing because its wing slats malfunctioned, an airline spokesman said. A piece of a wing flap fell from the jet as it landed at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport and two runways were closed temporarily for inspection but no debris was found, according to <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the British domestic news agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 took off just after noon. Shortly into the flight the pilot found he could not retract the slats on one wing, said the spokesman. Wing slats project at an angle at the edge of each wing. By increasing the area of the wing, the slats increase a plane's lift. The airline spokesman said the pilot dumped the aircraft's fuel and returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> about an hour later. `` The wing slats would not go back in but the problem would not have caused any serious control difficulties,'' he said. `` The pilot decided to return as a precaution and because he did not want to fly the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> with a fault on the aircraft. There was no danger and the aircraft made a perfectly normal landing.'' <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said the passengers would either be flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on another one of its aircraft or rebooked on another airline.

 Travellers were frustrated Sunday by a new wave of airport and railway personnel strikes while Italians had few newspapers to read about their Olympic skiing hero <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomba </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s state-run airline, canceled hundreds of flights to and from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s airports because of a 24-hour strike by ground personnel. It was the latest in a series of walkouts to protest lack of progress in contract renewal negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION>'s intercontinental flights and its connections to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s islands operated normally, as did flights by other airlines. Passengers, however, often had to wait for more than hour for their baggage. New contract talks are set to begin Monday. Long-distance train service from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main station suffered disruptions from a 24-hour strike by railway employees that started at 9 p.m. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s major daily newspapers did not publish Sunday as a result of a 48-hour nationwide walkout by journalists protesting stalemated contract talks. Only a few regional papers exempt from the strike came out Sunday. Television and radio ran limited news broadcasts Sunday without film reports. On Monday, television and radio stations are to cancel all newscasts. The journalists' strike prevented most Italians from reading about the exploits of <PERSON> Tomba </PERSON>, who won his second Olympic gold medal Saturday in alpine skiing. <PERSON> Paese </PERSON> <PERSON> Sera </PERSON>, one of the dailies exempt from the strike, ran a front-page headline saying `` <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomba </PERSON> Is Already a Legend.''

 Five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators who accepted a total of $ 297,000 in contributions from an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> company and its employees met with federal bank examiners investigating one of its subsidiaries, a newspaper reported Sunday. Within three months of the meeting, examiners backed off and ultimately cleared the subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, of wrongdoing, The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying. The thrift is owned by <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, Ariz.-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Executives of the company and its subsidiaries made the donations over the past several years, the newspaper reported Those accepting the contributions and the amounts, according to the News, were: <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., $ 41,900; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., $ 43,000; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 34,000; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., $ 112,000; and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said there was no connection between the contribution toward his 1988 re-election campaign and the April 9, 1987, meeting in which he and the four other senators discussed the investigation with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> examiners. `` If there was the slightest suggestion or hint that somehow somebody was going to contribute in return for some kind of favorable consideration, we do n't want that money,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said. `` I would n't accept it.'' Aides to the other senators said none was available to comment late last week, the newspaper reported. The banking investigators were looking into high-risk investments made by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> that could threaten its solvency, the News said. The contributions were permissible under federal election laws. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, said the timing of the donations and the meeting with regulators was `` an interesting coincidence.'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> told the newspaper he attended the meeting because he is a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and wanted to ensure <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> received a fair review. He said he was invited to the meeting by the other senators and was concerned <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was being harassed. The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying that after the meeting, the probe changed direction. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bank examiners `` were ready to ask for an enforcement action against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' an unidentified <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bankig official was quoted as saying. `` But that has changed.

 One of two American hostages released Sunday after their arrests by Israeli authorities in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said the most frightening part of the ordeal was being denied access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities or an attorney. `` It was confusion and of course fright, because when you're denied access to a lawyer and you're denied access to your own government, it's frightening to realize that you're cut off from any sort of legal protection,'' <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick </PERSON>, 25, said in a telephone interview with WCPO-TV in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Ms. <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> said the arresting authorities did n't tell the two why they were being held. Israeli officials allege that Ms. <PERSON> Glick </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were carrying posters bearing the names of slain Palestinians in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city. They were arrested Saturday on charges of incitement. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>'s mother, who talked to her son by telephone Sunday morning, said she was relieved that the two were unharmed during the ordeal, which lasted more than 24 hours. `` He said if he had n't been an American, they would have beaten him,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She said her son had written to her of Israelis beating Palestinian protesters Mrs. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> said her son told her the two were not demonstrating at the time of their arrest, though she said her son has been involved in past demonstrations against the Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> teach at a private school in of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Israeli police tried to make <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>, an art teacher, sign a confession in Hebrew that he was guilty of incitement, said Mrs. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>. However, she said, her son does n't speak Hebrew fluently and refused to sign. Authorities did n't allow the two to consult a lawyer or American officials until early Sunday, when <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, a representative of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was permitted to see them, said Mrs. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON>. The two were released shortly afterward. The Israelis have been trying to quiet three months of protest against their 20-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. More than 70 Palestinians have been reported killed by Israeli forces during that time. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> were arrested in a street near the Friends Girls' School, a Quaker-run facility in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> said. `` He was just walking down the street, he and this other teacher, going home for lunch,'' she said. `` Soldiers -LRB- from the Israeli army -RRB- stopped them and searched them and then turned them over to the police in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. `` He said he and this girl each had a plastic shopping bag and inside the bag, he had pieces of cardboard with names of different Palestinians who had been killed -LRB- allegedly by Israeli occupation forces -RRB-.'' She said she was n't sure if the names were intended for use in a protest, but that the two were not protesting at the time. `` He was in different protest marches, he's been tear-gassed, and obviously they have a picture of him,'' she said. `` The American consul -LRB- <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> -RRB- told me it was a warning to <PERSON> John </PERSON> to back off and mind his own business.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Benvenuto </PERSON> said her son believed press coverage of the arrests prompted the Israelis to release the two Americans early. He was initially told he would be detained for 48 hours.

 The Democratic presidential candidates debated the problems of the South on Sunday _ minus front-runners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. It was the Democrats' second debate in two days, with one more talkfest on the schedule Monday. `` Apparently, they do n't care much about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>,'' former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said of the missing contenders. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also criticized the two absent candidates at the first opportunity. `` Maybe they did n't enjoy the debate last week in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` We miss them and I want them to know they're missed,'' he added. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who announced last week he would not campaign actively in the Super Tuesday states, said his presence Sunday proved he was not writing off the South. `` I need and want and care for your votes,'' he said after the debate. He said there were no winners or losers in the debate `` with the exception'' of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman have been trading victories in the early contests. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Democratic caucuses. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the only candidate who did not criticize <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not coming to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` I do not know why they chose not to be here. I do not think it reflects a lack of interest or lack of integrity. They simply made other priorities,'' he said. Debate spokeswoman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoup </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited scheduling conflicts. About 800 people attended the debate at the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> Convention Center, and the forum was televised. Former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> hosted the debate, but he did not question the candidates. Television journalist <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> was the moderator. Several of the candidates described themselves as providing leadership to the rest of the field. `` My presence has influenced the other leaders,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` You now hear <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> saying we must challenge the multinational corporations _ that's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. When you now hear <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> saying stop the drug flow _ that's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. When you hear other candidates talking about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for the first time _ that's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, too, said he was showing the way for the rest. `` I'm the only one who has put out a budget, although I see each of these people gradually creeping towards that inevitability that I think they are going to have to face. `` The fundamental point here is that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> talks about his programs, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> talks about his programs, and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> talks about his. I'm the only one who puts out a budget to tell Americans the truth,'' he said. On another subject, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he supports a national energy policy that includes a price floor, incentives for domestic oil production and discouragement of oil imports. `` We have got to have a national energy policy,'' he said. The candidates appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Group Forecasts Growth in World Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 World merchandise trade grew more quickly last year than in 1986 and, barring economic upheavals, should expand at least as quickly this year, a report by a world trade group said Monday. The crash of world stock markets last October does not appear to `` have had an immediate adverse impact'' on global commerce, said the Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Early estimates show the volume of world merchandise trade rose by 4 percent last year compared to 3.5 percent in 1986, the world trade agency's analysts said. `` Barring a further major upheaval in financial markets or a serious recession in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it should grow at least as rapidly in 1988,'' they said. Last September, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> had predicted only about 3.5 percent growth for 1987. The report expressed concern about trade imbalances among the world's largest economies. Also, Third World debt and protectionist pressures still burden the world economy, it said. But consumer and investor confidence has survived the stock crash better than analysts forecasted immediately after the crisis, the report said. `` The improvement in the outlook for trade in recent months means that, all other things being equal, the risk of a recession in 1988 is smaller,'' <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> chief economist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackhurst </PERSON> said. The value of merchandise exports rose 15.5 percent in 1987 to a new record of $ 2.45 billion, partly reflecting the depreciation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and higher prices for crude oil and other commodities, the report said. Manufactured goods led the expansion with a 5 percent rise in volume, up from 3.5 percent in 1986. Farm exports rebounded to an estimated 4 percent rise after a decline of 1 percent, the report said. Reduced petroleum trade helped push trade volume in mining products down 1 percent. Imports by industrialized market economies remained the strongest force in world trade expansion, though growth slowed to 5 percent from 8.5 percent in 1986, the report said. Another factor cited was fast growth in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> economies such as <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. These countries have become significant buyers of manufactured goods on world markets as well as exporters, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> said. Export growth in developing countries slowed to 6 percent from 9 percent in 1986, but remained more vigorous than in other parts of the world. The report noted improved trade performance by a group of 15 heavily indebted countries, including 10 in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. State-controlled economies like <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the Soviet bloc expanded their trade less than other countries, particularly because they squeezed imports to adjust to lower export revenues from fuels and debt service requirements, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> includes about 100 member nations and was set up after World War II. It is both an agreement and a forum for removing trade barriers and ensuring the free movement of goods around the world. It is administered by a permanent commission by the same name in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>America's Showing Worst In 52 Years</HEAD>

 Time ran out for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> athletes when the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushlaw </PERSON> a tick away from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bobsled medal and Dutch speed skater <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gennip </PERSON> a triple gold medalist with time to spare. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games showing in 52 years. Two of the six were gold medals, won by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON> in figure skating and <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> in speed skating. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> also won a bronze in speed skating, making her <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only double winner. The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing ceremony before 60,000 people in <LOCATION> McMahon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. The 250 figure skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as well as young skaters from <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, site of the 1992 Winter Games, and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, site of this year's summer Games. Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, and banners reading `` Until We Meet Again'' in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands. Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Rushlaw </PERSON> and his three team members missed winning the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bobsled medal in 32 years when they was beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gennip </PERSON> took more than six seconds off her own world record in the 5,000 meters to win her third gold medal. American <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Docter </PERSON> was 22.87 seconds behind. East Germans finished 2-3 in the race. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> won the hockey silver medal, handing the Soviets their first loss of the Games, 2-1. The Soviets clinched the gold medal Friday night, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> finished seventh for the second straight time. In 1936, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> won just four medals, but only 51 were available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out. The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, with 11, and total medals, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s athletes won nine golds, 25 overall; while <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s team came in third in both gold medals, five, and overall medals, 15.

<TEXT>
 Bow-tied drivers in refrigerated vans are rushing prime rib and triple-layer carrot cake to upscale homes here to test the water for home-delivered gourmet meals in an industry dominated by pizza. The creation of `` The Order Inn,'' an experimental division of food giant <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was spurred by some compelling demographics, industry analysts say. The secretive test targets affluent singles and professional couples. `` What we're seeing is the beginning of an escalating delivery war, not just with pizza but with all kinds of home-delivered food,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for Godfather's Pizza, an <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based division of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are time-short and dollar-rich,'' said <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, whose company is shrinking sit-down areas in its new restaurants and mobilizing larger road forces. `` They do n't want to eat out. They're more than willing to pay to have it brought to their houses and I do n't see it ending.'' The explosion of convenience food in all its frozen and home-delivered variations can be traced to two late -'80s phenomena, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, managing director of research for the brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said his company's research shows 65 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes now have microwave ovens and 55 percent of all married women work. Households typically are short on time for cooking and long on money to pay others to do it. But restaurants have shortcomings as an alternative to kitchen toil, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and others note. Costs can be high and there's usually a wait Moreover, food industry analysts say that, in an age of VCRs, staying at home _ `` cocooning,'' as it's been dubbed _ is becoming an end in itself. Grocery stores around the country have scurried to meet the demand with wider offerings of prepared and semi-prepared dinners. The choices range from macaroni and cheese on the low end to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> broil and rattlesnake at the top. Even a drive to the grocery store can sometimes be too strenuous for the work-weary, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flatow </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market research company <ORGANIZATION> BrainReserve </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The goal is delivering a nice dinner to them; the challenge is overcoming high cost and logistics. `` Domino's Pizza has done it. Now all you've got to do is get veal marsala there and you've got it,'' <PERSON> Flatow </PERSON> said. `` The need is there. Nobody has fulfilled it yet.'' A General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> spokesman would not discuss the Order Inn venture, citing competitive factors. Local analysts say it has been under way for roughly six months. Industry watchers describe it as a logical step for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns the Red Lobster, <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s and <LOCATION> Olive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> restaurant chains. Based in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb, the company also has takeout experience. It recently sold its chain of <PERSON> Leann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>'s Chinese restaurants, which offered both sit-down and eat-at-home meals. Order Inn menus being dropped off at Twin Cities homes in recent months promise free delivery, usually in less than 20 minutes. Both lunches and dinners are available, seven days a week. The menu offers four selections in the appetizers and salad section, including chilled shrimp and popcorn chicken. Two sandwiches are available and five entrees, ranging from $ 5.75 for lasagna to $ 10.95 for prime rib. White-chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake highlights the three dessert choices. The menus include detailed instructions on reheating in a microwave or oven,. and a questionnaire asking what was ordered and how the food and service ranked. No verdict is in sight on the Order Inn, but experts say General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> seems to have the right idea. `` I do n't think there's any question there will be more to follow,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION>. A chief obstacle to success is keeping costs under control. With pizza, for example, gasoline, drivers, insurance and other costs take a $ 3 to $ 4 slice out of a $ 10 pizza, Godfather's <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> says. An extra hurdle for Order Inn is the daily gamble on how many orders will be placed for each item. Leftovers must be disposed of at day's end, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulstad </PERSON> confirmed. Whatever the future of the experiment, industry watchers predict scratch cooking will become ever more a recreational, weekend pastime. And restaurants, they say, should beware. `` It's really a fight for share of stomach,'' <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said.

 Angolan rebels claimed they killed 172 government soldiers and captured three Soviet-built tanks in recent fighting, the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The guerrillas destroyed three Angolan military units Friday in a battle east of Cuito Cuanavale in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the news agency reported.

The statement said five rebels were killed and four were wounded in Friday's battles. Both <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and South African-supported rebels have reported heavy fighting around Cuito Cuanavale in recent weeks <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> said in January that it forced government troops to flee Cuito Cuanavale and guerrilla forces encircled the vacated town. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has been predicting his rebels would defeat the remaining government in the area and then move into Cuito Cuanavale. The town was used as a government base in annual dry-season offensives against <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> strongholds in the southeast. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained its independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in Novermber 1975, and <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> lost to the Marxist forces in the civil war that followed.

 A Taiwanese dissident arrested trying to board a flight to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with a false passport said Monday he agreed to leave the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and would depart for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-Liang </PERSON> said he would leave Monday aboard a Korean Air flight for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and would travel on to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>, who edits <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was banned from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1979 for political activity.

Philippine authorities had offered to accept him as a political refugee but he declined, saying he wanted to return to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> was arrested Feb. 11 while preparing to board a flight for the Taiwanese capital of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Penn, In Rare Interview, Talks About Marriage To Madonna</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s divorce plans were created by the press, says her husband, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, who vowed in an interview published Sunday to `` refocus'' himself to avoid outbursts like the one that landed him in jail. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> filmdom </LOCATION>'s bad boy, discussed the strain of being married to the darling of American pop in a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> interview billed as the first since he was jailed for 32 days last summer after striking a movie extra. `` I feel uncomfortable commenting about my family situation because I'm no expert on the subject. Obviously making any family work is an endless job that's hard enough even when the family is n't public,'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> filed divorce papers in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Dec. 4, citing irreconcilable differences. Two weeks later, she asked to withdraw the petition and the court granted the request the same day, court records show. No reason was given in the court papers for her change of heart. But <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, 27, said nevertheless that talk about the possibility of divorce `` was more People magazine than reality. My attitude with the press right now is that I hope they've had their share of me. They've been very busy trying to find or make dirt. I'd like to get back to acting.'' <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> said his reported marital problems with <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, 29, stem from her fans' view of him as less-than-ideal marriage material. The couple were married Aug. 16, 1985, in a lavish ceremony on a <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, bluff overlooking the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, while news helicopters buzzed overhead. `` She belonged to them, to the public,'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said. `` And if anybody took her, I think they thought it should have been someone more acceptable, like <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. `` The public is very possessive about rock stars,'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said, `` and about her in particular. They do n't want to share their love.'' Penn may not be able to shed his reputation, but he said he plans to try to avoid future confrontations. `` Certainly I've thought about it,'' he said. `` I just have to refocus myself in another direction.'' Of his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jail experience, <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> said he was never afraid. `` I was in a jail with all the big shots, one person to a cell _ solitary confinement for 24 hours. So afraid, no. But bored, yes. After about two weeks of that kind of boredom, I think I would have preferred some fear.'' Penn spoke with the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> after dinner. He had fettuccine with shrimp. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> `` had a Caesar salad,'' he said. `` She always has Caesar salads.''

<TEXT>
 The body of a 23-year-old <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> man fatally shot at a British army checkpoint was exhumed Sunday for another autopsy in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s family requested the new autopsy. They said he had been harassed at the border and disputed the army statement that the bullet that struck him while he was near the border checkpoint at <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Northren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, on Feb. 21 was fired accidentally and ricocheted. An 18-year-old soldier has been charged with unlawful killing in the death and is being held on bail in military care. The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> governments are conducting separate investigations. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s body was buried Tuesday in <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monaghan </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> across the border from <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION> following an autopsy by British medical examiners. Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Saturday approved the exhumation after receiving a request from the family. An overnight police guard was placed at the cordoned-off grave, and after the exhumation the coffin was transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Monaghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for the autopsy. The dead man's sister, <PERSON> Eilish </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, claimed Sunday that her brother had received a number of death threats from British soldiers. She said in an an Irish radio interview that her brother received `` continuous harassment'' during border crossings from his <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> home to his job in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> is to make a statement on the incident to the <LOCATION> Dail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s parliament, Tuesday. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, claiming a solid victory Sunday in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential caucuses, was attacked by chief rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on the Iran-Contra affair, while Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> blasted the two GOP frontrunners on taxes <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses, scoring another victory on his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> home turf, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored a surprisingly strong second, followed by an uncommitted bloc. `` Today our message continued to shine,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said in a statement. `` Today's victory gives our national campaign another push toward success on Super Tuesday.'' The state Republican party provided no official count, but various campaigns agreed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who makes his summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, was far ahead, with former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> next, followed by the uncommitteds. `` I am delighted with what appears to be an overwhelming victory in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses, assuring my campaign of all 22 national delegates,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses pick delegates to the parties' state conventions this spring, where national convention delegates are chosen. Four of the six Democrats, meanwhile, gathered for a debate in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where the absentees _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> _ came under fire for skipping the event. At a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> debate in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ the first full-scale <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> face-off of the Southern campaign _ <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> took aim at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair. That, he said, was a big mistake. `` We never should trade arms for hostages. We should n't issue these reports and say we should n't trade arms for hostages _ the vice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and say it's all right. We should n't do those things,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, holding up a report on terrorism that was written by a presidential commission headed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not respond directly, but did say `` mistakes were made'' in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, whose campaign has been faltering after poor showings in early contests, accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of supporting tax hikes. `` They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported every single tax increase over the last eight years,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said. `` If they're nominated, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution is over, gone, dead.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> hit back, saying: `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s never met a deficit he did n't like. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman: ` You do n't care about deficits. You never have, and they're public enemy No. 1.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is planning to skip the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>' debate next Sunday in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, his campaign manager said. `` At this time, there are no debates on the schedule,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters after the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> debate. `` We're simply at a point where we've got 20 states; you've got to maintain control of your schedule.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION> newspapers, which also organized a Democratic face-off on Saturday. There, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made stinging attacks on rivals <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who largely bypassed early contests in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, is pinning his hopes on a strong showing on Super Tuesday, March 8. On that day, 20 states, mostly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, will hold primaries or caucuses. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, who disappointed many Democrats when he decided to sit out the presidential race, said Sunday he still has n't decided whether to lend his backing to his fellow Southerner. `` I like <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' `` I like what he says on national security.'' But, he said, `` I also like <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. ... I'm not ducking it. I just have n't decided who I'm going to vote for yet. I like <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and I like <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, responsible for the sharpest sparring among the Democrats lately, did not attend Sunday night's Democratic debate in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> attacked the absentees. `` Apparently they do n't care much about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>,'' the former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator said. Those who did attend the debate, however, admitted they're getting a bit tired of such gatherings. `` We really are kind of trapped in these 90-second sound bites trying to say a thing that makes a difference,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` There really is a problem in these debates, in that we have to answere in 60 seconds, or 90 seconds, and in some debates 30 seconds,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned Sunday from the deck of a fire boat in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s harbor, and pledged to make affordable housing a priority if elected. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> is one of the states voting on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, visited a crime-ridden neighborhood and decried the despair and frustration that has led to clashes between residents and police. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has pledged to raise the minimum wage, provide long-term health insurance for all Americans and to make fighting drugs his top priority. `` The Sandinistas are not threatening the streets of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> this morning,'' he said. `` The No. 1 threat is coke, crack and heroin.'' In another development, a poll published Sunday suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> have the lead among Democrats in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the biggest Super Tuesday state. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a clear lead, with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> a distant second. The poll was conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News. Among 301 likely Democratic primary voters surveyed, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 22 percent; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 21 percent; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 12 percent; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 10 percent; <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 8 percent; and <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> 1 percent. Among Republicans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the support of 60 percent of the 298 likely Republican primary voters surveyed. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 14 percent; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 8 percent; and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 3 percent. Fourteen percent were undecided. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points. It was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> political scientist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> through the university's Center for Public Policy.

<HEAD>Volcker Ends Self-Imposed Silence _ But Who Is Listening?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Does anyone pay attention to a 6-foot-7 kibbitzer who used to be the second most powerful man in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> is beginning to find out. The former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> recently broke a self-imposed vow of silence to resume offering opinions on deficits, taxes and the health of the economy. He seemed to show a little of the old magical influence last Thursday when stock and bond prices sank soon after he called for a tax increase and predicted that interest rates would rise. But some skeptics said the markets' behavior had nothing to do with what <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. `` He's not even associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> anymore,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` When you get a day like -LRB- Thursday -RRB-, everybody tries to say what killed the market and they drag out every news item that would have passed unnoticed,'' she said. So is <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> capable of moving the market? `` No. Not at all,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> still has not settled down to a new job since his departure from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> last August, when he was succeeded by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> is expected to announce his career decision within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, he is borrowing an office on Wall Street and heading a Washington-based commission on how to improve the quality of the nation's civil service. Speaking on the lecture circuit helps pay the bills and gives <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> a forum to express his views on the need to cut the federal budget deficit. The forum for his remarks Thursday was a luncheon meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION>. The night before, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> had spoken in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Day banquet of the <ORGANIZATION> Creve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> was chosen as a contrast to the 1987 speaker, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. `` We certainly know it's difficult to upstage a <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, so we said let's go back to something that's not comparable,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Allovio </PERSON>, the club's vice president. According to those who believe in <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s continuing influence, his remarks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> triggered a selloff in the bond market, which scared owners of stock-index futures, which in turn dragged down stock prices. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been up as much as 33 points, ended up with a loss for the day of 22.38 points, most of it in the final hour of trading. `` I have deep respect for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> and in my opinion there is not a single more influential economist in this country,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But can <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> influence trading decisions even without the control over the nation's money supply that he once had? Yes, <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> said. As an example, he mentioned <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a prominent economist for the giant Wall Street investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> whose outlooks used to move interest rates in the bond market. In December <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> announced plans to start his own consulting firm. `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> in his heyday had no authority and yet he was able to influence the markets,'' <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> said.

 More than 5,000 automotive engineers will meet this week to talk about everything concerning the life of a vehicle, from computerized conception to disposal on the junk heap. The Society for Automotive Engineers 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Exposition also will be attended by more than 700 industry suppliers, who will display their latest developments in automotive plastics and other materials, lubricants, design systems and maintenance. They'll occupty 167,000 square feet of exhibit space at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s downtown Cobo Hall from Monday through Thursday. The convention's theme is `` Engineering for the'90s _ Imagination, Innovation.'' Among featured speakers will be <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON>, deputy chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> Special sessions include a panel's look at the growing problem of disposing of automotive plastics as their use expands internally, in the engine and passenger compartment, and externally, as more and more body parts are composed of stronger, reinforced plastic substances. The engineers also will discuss efforts to reduce release of ozone-depleting chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs, used in production. Automaking has been the main source of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> emissions since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use in aerosol sprays in the 1970s. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Irving Bank, Target of Hostile Takeover, Predicts Bitter Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, target of a $ 1.08 billion hostile takeover proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> that was sanctioned last week by government regulators, said Sunday it would brief shareholders on why they should reject the bid and predicted a bitterly fought battle for their votes. `` Irving plans to bring to the attention of its shareholders all the factors they should consider regarding the offer, as well as questioning exactly how <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> intends to meet the numerous conditions to which its offer is now subject,'' the bank said in a press statement. It was <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s first official reaction to the approval given last Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 60 a share bid in cash and securities. The takeover fight has attracted attention because hostile acquisitions are unusual in the normally staid banking world. Some analysts have said government approval portends hostile takeovers of other banks. Fed and state officials dismissed the unfriendly nature of the bid as irrelevant and said they saw no competitive threat to a merger of the two <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, which would create the nation's 12th largest banking company with assets of nearly $ 42 billion Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> imposed one important condition of approval by requiring <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to sell additional stock to replenish the $ 264 million cash portion of the takeover. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said at least 60 percent of that amount must be raised before the transaction can be completed. Although <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> officials expressed confidence they could meet the condition, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> called it significant hurdles because it will dilute the stock's value and must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s offer depends on receipt of two-thirds of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s shares. The offer could encounter more difficulty because of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law that impedes hostile takeovers. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s approval `` clearly opens the way for a bitterly fought proxy battle.'' Proxies are written statements authorizing others to vote stock on the behalf of shareholders, a normal arrangement in publicly held companies. Management routinely solicits shareholder proxies but they are also used by others attempting to win control away from management. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s approval does not change the nature of the proposal, which continues to make no business sense and is not in the best long-term interest of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>,'' said the Irving statement. It said the bank `` is fully committed to continue opposing this grossly inadequate and highly conditional proposal, which the corporation's unanimous board is convinced is not in <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s best interests.''
