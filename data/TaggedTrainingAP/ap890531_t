 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and high-ranking <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaddaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> met on Wednesday to discuss improving relations between their two countries, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the meeting is a continuation of conciliatory talks that started between <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> at last week's <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit at <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gaddaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> is a cousin of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s intelligence chief. He came to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Tuesday. The agency gave no details on the meeting or elaborate on the duration of the visit. The summit was <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s first since 1976. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plummeted in 1977 with the late President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s league membership was suspended and most Arab states cut diplomatic ties in 1979, after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is among the last to soften its attitude toward <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told Egyptian journalists before Wednesday's meeting that Egyptian-Libyan relations `` are on the threshold of a new era based on a right foundation of frankness.'' On Monday, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> reopened its borders with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for the first time in more than a decade. The land route is used mainly by thousands of Egyptians working in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. During the years the border was closed, Egyptian workers had to travel between the two countries by way of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> or some other point. Negotiations are under way between a Libyan civil aviation delegation and Egyptian authorities for restoring direct air service between <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Egyptian-Libyan relations had been strained since 1972, when <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> rejected a bid by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> ffor an immediate merger of the two countries. They fought a brief border war in 1977. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s government has charged <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> with several atttempts to assassinate Libyan dissidents in Egyptian exile. It suspected <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of laying mines in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> that damaged 20 ships in the summer of 1984.

 A radical environmental group's founder and three other people were arrested Wednesday on charges they conspired to sabotage two nuclear power plants and an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bomb factory in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Two men were arrested early Wednesday while trying to use a propane torch to cut down a utility-line pole leading from an electrical substation in <LOCATION> Wenden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> said. A woman was arrested in <LOCATION> Prescott </LOCATION>, nearly 80 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Wenden </LOCATION>, in the alleged plot, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. A third man was arrested in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> on charges of conspiring with th others to sabotage commercial nuclear power plants at <LOCATION> Wintersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as well as the federal government's Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant near <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the defendants were members of a radical environmentalist group calling itself the <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy. The organization, which took its name from the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor who was impeached last year, has sent communiques to news organizations in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> claiming responsibility for criminal acts, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the arrests resulted from a three-year undercover investigation that began after vandals cut power lines at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in <LOCATION> Wintersburg </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, in May 1986. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, 42, who founded Earth First! _ the exclamation point is part of the name _ in 1979, was arrested in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> on a charge of conspiracy. He appeared before a federal magistrate there and was ordered held without bond. The other three appeared in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and also were ordered held for an appearance Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 37, both of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, were charged with conspiracy to sabotage a nuclear facility as well as destruction of an energy facility, destruction of property used in interstate commerce and destruction of government property. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said they were arrested while trying to cut down a utility pole supporting a power line that links an electrical substation with two irrigation pumping stations of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a multibillion-dollar canal system bringing <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> `` Peggy'' <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Millett </PERSON>, 35, of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, was arrested and charged with the same crimes, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also investigated acts of vandalism against ski-lift equipment at a <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> ski resort and the cutting of power-line poles at three uranium mines last year in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the bureau said. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> is a co-founder of Earth First!, said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondt </PERSON>, a spokesman in the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> office of the group's journal. The loosely organized group, which has no officers or formal membership, did n't plan the attack, <PERSON> Mondt </PERSON> said, but added: `` Some of us support the right to do those kinds of things.'' Earth First! was inspired in part by `` The Monkey Wrench Gang,'' a novel by the late <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> about a trio of environmentalalists who try to blow up the <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mondt </PERSON> said he was unaware of an organization called the <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meacham </PERSON> Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy, but noted that the organization's acronym would be EMETIC, a word defined as a medicine or other substance that causes vomiting.

<TEXT>
 The government, enforcing its policies to discourage Vietnamese refugees from coming to this British colony, on Tuesday towed a boat with 109 Vietnamese to a remote island, officials reported. They said boats carrying 745 refugees entered <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> waters Tuesday and a vessel with 109 people was towed to <LOCATION> Tai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION>, an island 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, because other facilities were filled. <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON> <PERSON> Chau </PERSON> has virtually no shelter. `` We have had more than 2,300 arrivals over the past three days. Our accomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed,'' said <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> refugee coordinator <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>. He said the people taken to <LOCATION> Tai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION> would have to stay aboard the boat or on the dock. `` There is one school building which some people may be able to use, but I think most will not be able to have covered accomodations,'' he added. The refugees will remain on the island until the government can find a place for them and then process them, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. He said he did not know how long that might take. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> received hundreds of thousands of Indochinese boat people after communist forces defeated the U.S.-backed governments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in April 1975. But thousands of Vietnamese are still fleeing their homeland. A year ago <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> adopted a screening policy that treats all Indochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fled political persecution. But that has not curbed the influx. For the first five months of this year 13,182 boat people have arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has agreed to attend an international conference on Indochinese refugees that is to be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> June 13-14.

 A 10-year-old elementary school student, apparently feeling he needed more friends, decided to buy them with thousands of dollars of his father's money. No one is exactly sure how much money the youngster spread around the school in his pursuit of friendship, although officials have recovered $ 3,000 from classmates and their parents. `` He was handing out $ 5, $ 10, $ 20 and $ 100 bills,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, the school system's security officer. `` The boy apparently got into his father's stash.'' The money-for-friendship enterprise was uncovered by <ORGANIZATION> Ritta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> J.W. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> last week when a student asked him to break a $ 10 bill. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> asked where the student had gotten the money, and was told the fourth-grader was giving it away. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said no disciplinary action was taken against the spendthrift youngster.

<HEAD>Experts: Another Asteroid Will Pass Close, But No Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An asteroid will pass by Earth just a little more than 8 million miles away this Saturday, the closest approach since a `` near miss'' in March, but presents no danger to the planet, astronomers say. The asteroid, estimated to be one to two miles across, may be visible as a faint star, and will grow brighter as it approaches at 20 miles per second, astronomer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said in a release Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. On March 23, an asteroid came within 450,000 miles of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which was considered a near miss in astronomical terms. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysics </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that the asteroid due Saturday is the sixth relatively close approach this year. He called the number a `` statistical fluke.'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said no one should worry about this or any other known asteroid _ the one that hits probably wo n't be spotted until it's too late to do anything `` It's not a question of if an asteroid will hit us, but when,'' <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said. `` And it will make earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters pale in comparison to its destructive force.'' Some astronomers believe an asteroid larger than a quarter mile across hits the Earth once about every 50,000 years. The last crater formed by an asteroid occurred in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> about 50,000 years ago, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said. An asteroid that struck the Earth 65 million years ago may have wiped out the last of the dinosaurs, some scientists believe. Such a strike today would have effects similar to nuclear war without the radiation. It would level buildings for several hundred miles and would create giant tidal waves, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said. Scientists in the 1960s and 1970s thought asteroids that pass by <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> were rare; today they believe there may be hundreds and possibly thousands of them. It is unclear if there are more asteroids or if astronomers have simply become better at finding them, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A new public service announcement against capital punishment features an unusual cast of characters: the homeless. The <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> television commercial, to be offered soon for international broadcasts, uses 50 homeless people. `` I did n't want people that were well-fed, happy human beings, to try to pull off the roles of people all over the world who have been imprisoned for long periods of time,'' said commercial director <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who co-produced `` The Sting'' and directed `` My Bodyguard.'' `` The homeless are disenfranchised people, and they are people who are, in effect, oppressed,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who like others donated work for the project. The black-and-white ads cast the homeless as prisoners facing execution, their heads covered in bags before an imaginary killing. The 30 - and 60-second commercials conclude with the shot of a falling guillotine blade <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> said the faces of the homeless, unlike those of professional actors, naturally are filled with hopelessness and defeat. `` I think by seeing them on the screen, your attention is drawn to them,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> said. `` We're talking about a larger issue. The homeless people sort of represent people in prison.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who runs the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> restaurant, selected his cast from the crowds of people who gather for a free meal the restaurant provides every Tuesday. Those cast were paid $ 40 for the one-day commercial shooting and given lunch. `` The saddest thing was to see them leave at the end of the shoot,'' said producer <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Baren </PERSON> of Riverrun Films. `` It was horrible to think where they were going back to. They were just really terrific people.'' The commercial's makers hope television stations across the country and around the globe will broadcast the spot. It also will be shown at the commercial competition at <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> starting June 19.

 <LOCATION> EL </LOCATION> <LOCATION> PASO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ Subject: <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Mission: Collect and share with law enforcement agencies information on drug -, weapon - and Number of arrests: None. `` Our first task is tactical intelligence _ that which the field agents can use to cause an arrest or seizure,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>, director of the center at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bliss </LOCATION> that publishes its phone number but reveals little else. EPIC might tell the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> where to find a specific marijuana-laden ship off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. Or it might tell the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> who a certain smuggler hangs around with. But it looks farther downrange, too. `` What's going to happen two years from now in what part of the world? We try to figure that out,'' said <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>. At EPIC, representatives of 10 federal agencies gather evidence and piece together a criminological jigsaw puzzle that displays drug smugglers and other criminal organizations. The law enforcement consortium does n't make seizures or arrests and does n't take credit for the arrests it produces `` They are our primary source of intelligence,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, senior tactical coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, an El Paso-based union of federal agencies that chases and arrests drug smugglers along the U.S.-Mexican border. He declined to recount specific cases in which EPIC information resulted in large-scale busts. EPIC started out in 1974 as the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, with 35 employees from the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> working in cramped quarters. Four years later it had a congressional mandate, a new name, 106 employees from six federal agencies and 16,000 square feet of space in central <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. Now the 15-year-old intelligence network occupies a brand-new, 57,000-square-foot building on <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bliss </LOCATION>, where 200 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> labor 24 hours a day. Some of those agencies have been known for fierce turf battles, but <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON> said that's rare at EPIC. `` It's pretty unique in that we all get along good. After 90 to 120 days, agents lose their agency identity and become part of EPIC.'' EPIC gives <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> `` threat assessments'' _ dossiers on illegal organizations, along with when and where they are expected to operate next. It prepares similar assessments for the Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Lightning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which tries to keep drug shipments out of southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Other information goes to the agencies making up EPIC, the lead law enforcement agencies in 50 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. It gets upwards of 300,000 inquiries a year. Usually, when police ask for information, EPIC asks why. `` Something made someone make that call _ either he saw or heard something,'' <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON> said. `` We ask for that information, and we build on that. We look for patterns and trends all the time.'' Bits of information can be assembled like a puzzle: an ID number on the tail of a plane, a series of large cash bank deposits and the sighting of a suspect could start an investigation ending in an arrest and seizure. Sometimes it turns out that different police agencies are investigating the same organization but are n't aware of each other. In those cases, EPIC brings the agencies together and helps plot investigation strategies. Some of the information comes from those cases. Other times, member federal agencies contribute. Some data come from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> offices abroad. Each agent working at EPIC is limited to the investigative methods his or her agency is permitted under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law; a wiretap, for example, would require a court order. If there's any criticism of EPIC among law enforcement agencies, it's that the center's computer system needs to be upgraded. `` Just bring them up to the state of the art,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, represents the district where EPIC resides. A few years ago, he helped fight off a proposal to move it to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Now he would like to improve its computers. `` My goal is to make it the absolute state-of-the-art intelligence-gathering center in the country,'' he said. Just how advanced the computer and communications systems are is a secret. <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON> is n't telling, but he said a police agency calling EPIC probably will find the information it wants on a suspect. `` If he's ever been the subject of an investigation or an associate of someone who's been the subject of an investigation,'' he said, `` chances are pretty good.''

 The bombardment of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the blockade of its ports has produced an anonymous armada of small craft bringing in food, ammunition and even whisky to the 1 million trapped Christians. Here is a report on how it stays afloat.

<TEXT>
 Most nights, a dozen small cargo ships zigzag through shellfire for ports along <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast to deliver food and ammunition to Christians besieged by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Moslem allies. Others dart in during daylight, often as shells and rockets explode around them and knots of people stand on shore and cheer. The ships' cargoes have become the lifeline for the estimated 1 million Christians trapped in their enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` This is why there are no serious shortages,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations. `` The ships bring in vegetables, canned fruit and cattle as well as ammunition.'' Not all the provisions are essentials. An east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> businessman said one company recently received 11 containers of whisky. The police spokesman said at least 12 ships a day make it through the Syrian blockade. They dock mainly at <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and the ancient port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>, 10 miles farther north, and at smaller harbors in between. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two or three ships out of every 15 carry weapons and ammunition from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival and the Christians' only ally in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war began on March 8 when <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered his troops, most of whom are Christians, to blockade ports run by Moslem militias. Fierce artillery battles followed and the Syrians blockaded Christian ports. Despite a cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on May 11, the Syrians shell the Christians' coastal strip daily to try to prevent supplies from reaching <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces. In recent days, the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> have deployed navy gunboats to tighten the blockade, and some cargo ships have been turned back. Yet some Christians believe the Syrians are not tightening the noose as much as they might. `` With the firepower the Syrians have they could be doing a lot more,'' one source said. `` We do n't know why there is this restraint, except possibly because they're not yet prepared to go all the way.'' The danger zone is about six miles off the coast. <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassine </PERSON>, 23, was a crewman aboard the 1,000-ton Lebanese freighter <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, which took several hits on May 18 as it approached <PERSON> Oqaibeh </PERSON>, five miles north of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, with a cargo of food. He and three other crewmen were wounded when a Syrian 130mm shell hit the mast. Lying in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> in </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, his head heavily bandaged, <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> said the freighter was about five miles off <PERSON> Oqaibeh </PERSON> `` when the shells started falling all around us.'' `` Some of them were hitting only a few feet away, sending cascades of water over us. Then we were hit. I saw my brother <PERSON> Boulos </PERSON> and the others fall,'' he said. `` A fishing boat which was in the vicinity came through the shelling and took us ashore,'' <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> said. A Christian source said that most of the ship captains come from the <LOCATION> Oqaibeh </LOCATION> area. `` Their agency pays them about $ 5,000 a trip,'' he said. `` The seamen who used to earn $ 200 a month now get $ 200 a trip, which usually lasts between 24 and 48 hours.'' The ships sail mainly between the Christian enclave and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, 100 miles to the northeast. But Christian sources reported that some also pick up cargoes of fruit and vegetables from the southern ports of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and Tyre, both run by Moslem militias. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> said merchants charter boats to take produce to the Christian enclave. `` They do n't want to waste their produce,'' he said. `` They're ready to sell to the devil. The Shiite Moslem Amal militia, which controls Tyre, tried to stop merchants there from sending goods to east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But sources said the businessmen, who pay hefty fees to Amal, told the militia they would stop only if the militia bought all their produce. The traffic is not all one-way. About 15,000 Christians have fled the enclave aboard ferries from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The vessels anchor offshore, and passengers must take a nerve-jangling ride in small boats in darkness _ and often under shellfre _ to reach the ferries. Hundreds more have evacuated aboard a Norwegian Hovercraft, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, which slips into <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and other ports at night.

<TEXT>
 This country's parliament has a tradition of free public access, so it was n't much trouble for about 50 masked intruders to barge into the chamber and rip up documents as legislators looked on. The intruders, said by police to be members of a radical squatter's organization, fought briefly with unarmed parliament guards during Tuesday's raid. Police said they arrested about 30, but the rest escaped. It was the first time demonstrators had disturbed a session of the Folketinget, or parliament, police said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ninn-Hansen </PERSON>, said afterward that the intruders would be prosecuted and that security in Christiansborg Palace, which houses the parliament, would be reviewed.

<HEAD>Comprehensive Study Show Skin Cancer Galloping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 29-year study of cancer in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> shows the rate of cases increased faster among women than men, especially skin cancer caused by too much sun. Malignant melanoma caused by overexposure to ultraviolet rays was increasing by 6.6 percent a year and ine 1987 represented 3.5 percent of all cancer cases, said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Karolinska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. A law requiring doctors to report all cancer cases to a national registrar since 1958 has yielded `` a unique foundation'' for health care and planning, since it covers 100 percent of the population in specific areas, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> said. The study, released Tuesday by the hospital, covered <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gotland </LOCATION>, a large rural island in the Baltic. <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Tornqvist </PERSON>, who was in charge of the register, said the rate of all forms of cancer increased by 29 percent for women and 15 percent for men in the Swedish capital from 1958 to 1987. The figures were higher in <LOCATION> Gotland </LOCATION>. Malignant melanoma `` could become the major form of cancer in the next century'' because many people who have damaged their skin have not yet developed the disease, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> said. He attributed the increase among Swedes to their more frequent holiday trips to warmer countries and their penchant for sunbathing. One reason for the general rising incidence of cancers is that people are living longer, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> said. Lung cancer was the most common cancer, but it decreased among men along with a decline in smoking.

<HEAD>Italian Strikers Give Tourists a Break</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Tourists got an after-hours look at the Roman Forum and free tours of the ancient ruins, the <LOCATION> Palatine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the Coliseum because of an unusal work protest by the caretakers. The Forum is normally closed on Tuesday afternoon, but the caretakers chose instead to work overtime and give away free tickets as a way of protesting work conditions and `` Cultural Ministry bureaucracy.'' The workers said they want more money and they want the ministry to train them and offer guided tours of the Forum. They also want the ministry to hire more people and to keep the site open for more hours. Tourists in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> often miss the chance to see archeological sites and musems because of limited visiting hours and recurrent strikes. The unusual protest was designed to gain public support, said a woman employee who asked not to be identified. `` If we stopped work, we would just get a bad press. This way we can show people that we are also interested in them,'' she said.

 By accusing <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of unfair trade practices, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have dealt a major setback to Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s cautious efforts to open the vast Indian market to foreign goods. In a nation that has long aspired to self-sufficiency and thrown up a bewildering and costly barricade of red tape to foreign investment, the few <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brand names to reach consumers have achieved overnight popularity. Wrangler jeans, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> music cassettes and <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarettes are among American goods that entered <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government started easing the protectionist policies of his mother and predecessor, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is poised to follow. All are manufactured in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> under license and in association with local partners, with the foreign share limited to 40 percent. The opening of Indian markets started in 1985, a few months after <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> took office. But observers say last week's citing of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> under the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Omnibus Trade Act could hurt the process. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> perception seems to be that it can open up Indian markets with a crowbar,'' said industrialist <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>. `` From the logical point of view, it is better to use goodwill.'' `` Maybe they got impatient. I doubt whether the intended results will follow _ and maybe contrary reactions will set in,'' he added. In an editorial entitled `` A Super Folly,'' the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said: `` By branding <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as an unfair trade partner at a time when the country is attempting to move towards more open trade, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> runs the risk of reversing the tide of opinion building up in favor of liberalization.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official acknowledged <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had eased its trade restrictions but said much remains to be done. `` There has definitely been some liberalization, but there is a considerable distance to go,'' he said, speaking on condition he not be identified further. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of violating the 1988 trade act by impeding direct foreign investment and closing its insurance market to foreign companies. The law allows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to impose tariffs of 100 percent on goods from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> if negotiations fail to remove the barriers within 18 months. Despite its tentative reforms, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> still levies customs duties in excess of 200 percent on some foreign goods and industrial components. The government has yet to respond to the American invitation for negotiations. Its only comments have been that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action is unfair and irrational. `` Negotiations can not be held under threat. How can you expect any self-respecting country to do it?'' said <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>, who led a delegation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this month to try to ward off the citing of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> under the Omnibus Trade Act. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation also came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> earlier this month for discussions with Indian government officials. `` We justified our restrictions because of our balance of payments constraints,'' said <PERSON> Anwarul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who took part in the talks. `` But even while offering justifications, we are liberalizing. Our trade has never been so liberal.'' <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been declining, from $ 1 billion in 1987 to $ 700 million in 1988. They said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s tough measures were unjustified since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was responsible for less than 1 percent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' overall trade deficit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which also was cited, is responsible for 44 percent. Only one other nation was singled out _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON> acknowledged the tremendous appeal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods and services for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brands, techniques and marketing systems are the best in the world,'' said <PERSON> Singhania </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> J.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which makes synthetic fabrics, paints and cosmetics. Among consumer items, U.S.-franchised stereo cassettes hold a virtual monopoly in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Western music market. `` CBS cassettes sell very well,'' said <PERSON> Kishore </PERSON>, a salesman at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> music shop who declined to give his last name. `` Since they came in the market, <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the major local company -RRB- has dropped.'' Another indicator of the appeal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods is the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s semiannual sale of obsolete equipment. A weekly news magazine, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Today, said recently that buyers bid feverishly for 10-year-old air conditioners, sometimes offering more than the price of a new Indian model, because `` of the strong mystique of the foreign brand.''

 People at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign rallies in southwestern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> last year heard first from his foremost cheerleader, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON>. The outspoken and sometimes abrasive state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> party leader positioned himself at the podium for more than an hour before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival and led thousands of supporters in songs taunting Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. As <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s national committeeman since 1980, <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> never has been at a loss for words. Until now. After months of tireless work on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> was rewarded with a nomination as ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. It initially appeared the 52-year-old Italian-American lumber magnate would sail through <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, but <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON>'s propensity for coarse humor and off-color remarks have haunted him For example: _ A few days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to run as vice president, <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> amid rumors linking him romantically to a former female lobbyist. `` If that's the only thing you can say about a 41-year-old man _ that he danced close with a good-looking woman _ then I think he'll make one hell of a vice president.'' _ <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> does n't deny he made an offensive hand gesture to a political foe in the basement of a bar, but after it was reported called it good-natured political sparring. _ A January 1988 <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s magazine article about the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> GOP portrayed <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> as a sexist and quoted him as making vulgar remarks about the size of a woman's breasts. <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> says he was misquoted. _ In August 1988, <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> said of his political adversaries, `` I know what sodomy is because that's what Democrats are always doing to me.'' <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> complains his comments have been misinterpreted, and that some of the people now judging him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> do n't understand his humor There's been grumbling in Italian newspapers over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of an ambassador who is an expert fund-raiser with a sharp tongue but little foreign policy experience In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON>'s confirmation vote was stalled until at least Wednesday because of concerns of Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>. The delay caused <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON>, the grandson of <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> immigrants, to miss <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> last week. `` He's certainly not pleased ... with reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wants to make him twist in the wind as punishment for so-called past sins,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Secchia </LOCATION> employee fielding media calls. <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> has declined all requests for interviews since his confirmation was stalled two weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON>'s nomination, but Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, warned that <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> might be an embarrassment At home in Grand Rapids, those who know <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> well see him primarily as a generous, hard-working, good-hearted community leader _ who just happens to put his foot in his mouth occasionally. `` He's a street fighter,'' said businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Yob </PERSON>, a close friend and political associate. `` When he wants something, he goes for it.'' Even his political foes acknowledge <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> has been a driving force in the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. As chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the father of four has turned the Grand Rapids business into a $ 400 million lumber, restaurant and real estate empire, the fourth-largest building products distributor in the country He has vowed to tone down his rhetoric when he takes on his new job in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. But some of his political adversaries are dubious. `` I never suspected I would hear the name <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON> in the same sentence with the word diplomat,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> attorney and deputy state director of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign. `` His mouth works faster than his mind. ... I do n't think it'll be long before he'll put his foot in his mouth when he gets over to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said But others believe <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will be disarmed. `` I get the feeling that he is moving on to a different phase of his life, where he going to learn and practice the art of diplomacy. But I know it probably wo n't come easy,'' national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Committeewoman <PERSON> Ronna </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> said.

 High schools are requiring students to read almost exactly what they did 25 years ago: heavy on Shakespeare but light on works by female and minority authors, according to a survey. Eighty-four percent of public high schools assign students `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>,'' the tearful Shakespearean play that tops the list of required works, according to the nationwide survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Teaching of Literature at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. But only one of the top 10 most frequently assigned works was by a female author _ `` To Kill A Mockingbird,'' by <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. No works were by minorities, according to the survey of 322 public schools, 80 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools and 86 private schools conducted last spring. `` I think the survey shows schools are still very much concerned with emphasizing good literature. They continue to assign classics complemented with modern and accessible works,'' said the survey's author, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Applebee </PERSON> `` At the same time, it's disturbing that there are essentially no books by minority authors working their way into the canons, and little representation of women.'' Following `` <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>,'' 81 percent of public high schools required `` Macbeth.'' `` Huckleberry Finn,'' the classic <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> novel, was the third most assigned work, with 70 percent requiring it. The rest of the top 10 were, in order, `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>,'' by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, `` To Kill A Mockingbird,'' `` The Scarlet Letter,'' by <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, `` Of Mice and Men,'' by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Hamlet,'' `` The Great Gatsby,'' by <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, and `` Lord of the Flies,'' by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Golding </PERSON>. The most frequently assigned books by minority authors are <PERSON> Lorrainne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansberry </PERSON>'s `` A Raisin in the Sun,'' required in 19 percent of schools, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s `` Black Boy,'' required by 7 percent, the survey found. <PERSON> Applebee </PERSON> added, however, that commonly used high school literature anthologies frequently include works by minority and female authors. The survey appeared to answer conservative critics who have lately accused schools of watering down curricula and retreating from the classics. Such charges gained currency in the recent best-sellers `` The Closing of the American Mind'' by <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, and `` Cultural Literacy,'' by E.D. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. The study also showed, surprisingly, that public, private and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> high schools are assigning nearly identical books, said <PERSON> Applebee </PERSON>. At the 80 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools surveyed, the top-10 list included the same books as public schools, but in different order. `` Huckleberry Finn'' ranked first, followed by `` The Scarlet Letter'' and `` Macbeth.'' `` Macbeth'' topped the list at 86 private schools surveyed. Unlike public and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools, that top-10 list included <PERSON> Homer </PERSON>'s epic poem, `` The Odyssey,'' but omitted `` Of Mice and Men.'' The report replicated a similar survey 25 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> dominated the list, as he does now. `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>'' replaced `` Macbeth'' in first place, apparently boosted by the popularity of the film version. `` <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Marner </PERSON>,'' by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, was the only book showing a dramatic change in popularity. The 19th century novel about an old miser who turns to a more human life through his love of a little girl ranked third 25 years ago, but dropped off the top-10 list in the latest survey. The survey had a margin of error of 3 points.

 In a city where pork bellies have made commodity traders rich, it took a European, Chef <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON>, to master the art of turning goose livers into gold. After 26 years, <LOCATION> Chef </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> next month is closing his <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> restaurant called the Bakery. `` I grossed more than $ 1,300,000 a year for 26 years, and that's only five dinners a week _ no lunch, no bar and no ` early birds,''' <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> said `` Some restaurants give a discount for diners who arrive before 5 p.m., but I never did that because my meat supplier could n't guarantee quality that early. The income estimate is even more remarkable in that the Bakery has never seated more than 170 people at one time, and all of its five-course dinners had a fixed price: from $ 5 in 1962 to $ 25 this year. When <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> opened the Bakery, it was one of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first restaurants outside of the downtown area to feature classic French cuisine. Resembling an unpretentious European inn, it also was one of the first where the food got top billing over the decor. It was also a place to sit down and listen to <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> philosophize about food. Every night he was in town, he visited each table, talking with patrons as he doled out his fresh country pate. `` We have every day fresh flowers, and sometimes the silver matches, but the important thing is the food on the plate,'' he said. And the food on the plate often is beef <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>. It may be a haute cuisine cliche now, but <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> made his first hit by smearing beef with goose liver pate and baking it in a pastry shell. `` The food writers joke about beef <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> now, but they all raved about it once, and I know 50 percent of our sales after 26 years is still beef <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>.'' Other popular items at the Bakery have included pork loin stuffed with Hungarian sausage and roast duck served with cherry sauce. On his retirement at age 70, <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> is giving his 24,000-volume cookbook library to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>. Other items in the collection will go to <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` Some of my cookbooks go back to the late 1400s and they may be important in teaching the history of food,'' he said. Some of his more modern works, though, were written by <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> himself, who is the author of `` The Chef's Secret Cookbook,'' `` American Gastronomy,'' `` The Chef's New Secret Cookbook,'' `` The Bakery Restaurant Cookbook'' and the 15-volume `` Cookery Americana.'' A native of <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Szathmary </PERSON> came to this country in 1951, and spent 11 years in food research before becoming a restaurateur. `` I could not do it now,'' he said. `` The restaurant business has changed too much. ... `` One thing I am proud of, though,'' he added. `` I never served one kiwi fruit.''

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> declared Tuesday, `` I think I know what I should do,'' but did n't say whether that meant he'd resign over ethics charges.

But <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> denounced as an `` outrageous lie'' a televised report that he was under criminal investigation. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was launching a preliminary criminal investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have previously said the department was monitoring ethics proceedings against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and had not decided whether to look into his financial dealings. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also quoted a source as saying <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> planned to announce his resignation either Wednesday or Thursday, but delay its effective date so the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee could rule on whether he accepted gifts from a business partner with a direct interest in legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, after returning from a weekend getaway in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, told reporters, `` I do n't have a statement right now I expect to have one before the week's out.'' `` I think I know what I believe to be in my best interests and the interests of the institution,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters as he returned to the Capitol. `` I want to be fair to myself, my family, my reputation, and I want to be fair to this institution that I've served for 34 years. While the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat held his cards close, fellow Democrats were openly angling for leadership posts in what they expected to be a major shakeup in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy. A handful of senior lawmakers were pushing for the No. 2 and No. 3 jobs of majority leader and majority whip. That assumes, as most in th House do, that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will soon resign and the current majority leader, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will be elevated to the speakership. The current whip, Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, had been expected to fight for the No. 2 job, but he said Friday he would resign in the face of separate ethics questions about a bond investment he made. He said a congressional investigation of that issue could harm the party. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he had been told by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents that he was neither a target nor a subject of a criminal investigation. But government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a CBS News report that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations regarding personnel and expenditures in the congressman's office. One source said there were allegations of a no-show employee being kept on <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s payroll. The source stressed, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s inquiry was at this point preliminary and agents did not know whether it would lead to a full-scale criminal investigation. Though <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> denied that he was a target or subject, under the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of a preliminary inquiry, no one is a subject or target of such a probe. Some Democrats were making clear they were running out of patience, and one lawmaker pointedly referred to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s announcement as an example for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to follow in deciding what to do about the ethics committee's allegations of financial impropriety `` He has to take a hard look at how <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> conducted himself,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., calling the Californian's gesture `` courageous and selfless. `` It is in the best interests of the institution and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to get this mess behind us,'' <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said. `` Regrettably, that involves the resignation of the speaker.'' Last week, sources close to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he had all but reached a decision to resign his leadership post and was leaving for the weekend to draft a statement, defending himself, that could be delivered along with the announcement of his resignation as early as Wednesday. But they also cautioned that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was torn between such a move and fighting the ethics charges to some legal conclusion. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Tuesday, `` I hear that he's going to resign. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is a close ally of the speaker but said he had not talked to him this week, added, `` My personal opinion is that he'll do it Wednesday or Thursday.'' One source close to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he did not expect an announcement until at least Thursday. Another source said the death Tuesday of Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., could cause <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to delay as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would be involved with attending services for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' oldest member <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> alluded to his legal fight and to a motion to dismiss the most serious charges against him, telling reporters, `` I'm convinced our motions are legally well grounded. The ethics committee is due to take up the motion to dismiss charges at a meeting on Thursday, and it was seen as likely to reject the defense effort. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the ethics committee, said in answer to a question that the panel also might expand its action to other ethics allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a reference to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s investment in a gas well drilling venture and a deal involving a nursing home company. `` It's possible we could vote for a preliminary inquiry on those two issues,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been formally charged with 69 instances of violating House rules, including charges he circumvented limits on outside income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and charges he improperly accepted $ 145,000 in gifts from a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, businessman with a direct interest in legislation. Should <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> be promoted into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s job, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., remains the favorite to succeed him, although Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., also has expressed interest in the The most ferocious contest is expected for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s whip post. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, Reps. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., are running, and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., also has been mentioned as <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, already running full-speed, said Tuesday he's telling colleagues his middle-class constituency makes him the best candidate. The suburban <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> claimed 60 solid commitments of support, slightly less than half the 130 he said he needed to win. <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> said the demographics of his district _ a blue-collar industrial area seasoned with middle-level managers _ `` is contrasted, of course, to the constituencies on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, and the inner-city constituency of Mr. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Court Official Issues Final Recommendations in Louisiana Desegregation
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A special official appointed to draft an integration plan for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s higher education system recommended Tuesday that no universities be closed or merged and that they be governed by a powerful unified board. The final recommendation by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, who was appointed by a three-judge federal panel, contained few changes compared to his preliminary proposal April 18, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, an attorney with Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s administration. `` I do n't think this is a cosmetic plan,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said at a news briefing Tuesday night. `` I think you will look on the landscape of higher education in five years and it will not be the same. The changes will be fundamental _ quality and desegregation.'' The court will have the final say on the plan. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he did not know if the judges would hear further comment from the parties in the case _ including the predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s alumni association _ before deciding whether to approve it. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who had pushed for a single board with authority to implement desegregation plans, was pleased by <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>'s recommendation. `` The single board is the linchpin of this whole thing,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. State Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not seen the recommendation and declined to comment immediately. Other parties were not available for immediate comment. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> was appointed to draw up a new plan after the court ruled last year that a 1981 desegregation agreement between the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had failed. The plan called primarily for spending millions of dollars to upgrade faculty, programs and facilities at Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>. The dispute began 15 years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit against the state accusing it of operating a dual system of higher education for blacks and whites. Under the plan recommended Tuesday by <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: _ The single governing board would consist of 17 members, including at least seven blacks. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> said the board should show a geographic balance, represent all schools and include a student. Board members would be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Members would not have to come from existing boards. Black leaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to the needs of historically black <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>. _ All current university systems would be abolished in favor of one system under the unified board. A new president for higher education would be selected and an interim president would be appointed during the search. _ <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> would be the state's flagship institution with the greatest number of graduate programs and the toughest admission standards. Currently, all <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> colleges have an open-admissions policy. _ A second tier of schools _ <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> _ would also offer graduate programs, but fewer than LSU. Those schools would have less stringent admissions standards. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>'s recommendation would allow the new board to add other schools to the second tier. Other four-year colleges would have still less restrictive admissions and limited graduate degree programs. _ Two-year community colleges would offer open admissions and be responsible for most remedial education. _ The state must continue to spend money to enhance Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> did not recommend a dollar amount. Previous agreements between <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> to end program duplication should be carried out, while the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> and Southern law schools in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> should agree to let students at one school take courses at the other, <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> recognized the state's financial difficulties, including a projected deficit of more than $ 700 million for the next fiscal year and possible cuts to higher education.

 Higher ticket prices, strong long-running musicals, several acclaimed new plays helped Broadway end its season with a record box-office take. Theaters took in $ 262 million, up 4 percent over the 1988-89 season's total of $ 253 million, according to figures released Tuesday. The League of American Theaters and Producers also said attendance was 8 million, off slightly from last season's record 8.1 million but still higher than the 7 million of two years ago. `` It was a good season. It had strong box-office dollars and solid attendance,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, the league's director of research. `` There were fewer musicals but there were more plays. Over the last four years, it was one of the best seasons, attendance-wise.'' Much of the box-office strength came from long-running musicals particularly `` The Phantom of the Opera'' and `` Les Miserables,'' each grossing more than $ 500,000 a week, and other veteran hits like `` Cats'' and `` Me and My Girl.'' The only new musical to demonstrate much box-office muscle is `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' which has been running at slightly under capacity since it opened in January. The compilation of dance numbers from some of the choreographer's biggest hits has been grossing about $ 520,000 a week. It also has a top ticket price of $ 55. The average ticket price rose from $ 31.10 to $ 33.90, up 6 percent from last year, the league said. Much of the rise, <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said, was because theatergoers were paying full price for tickets to hot shows like `` Phantom'' and `` Les Miserables,'' which are not available at half-price discount. Only seven musicals _ including a revival of `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' _ opened on Broadway during the 1988-89 season, compared with 15 the previous year They included such flops as `` Legs Diamond,'' `` Chu Chem'' and `` Welcome to the Club,'' as well as such still-running shows as `` Black and Blue'' and `` Starmites.'' `` For a variety of reasons, it's becoming increasingly difficult to mount a large musical,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` But I do look to the fact that there were two seasons fairly recently when there was as many as 20 musicals. You have to be optimistic to be in this business and we are.'' Twenty-one plays, including nine revivals, opened on Broadway during the 1988-89 season. Among the biggest successes were <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s farce, `` Rumors,'' and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>'s `` The Heidi Chronicles,'' which is the favorite to win the best play <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> on June 4. Box-office receipts also climbed for touring productions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, jumping to a record $ 255 million. It was a 14 percent increase from the previous season's $ 223 million.

<HEAD>Authorities Use Memories of Cultural Revolution to Fight Students
^Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In their gloves-off campaign to end the pro-democracy movement, authorities are tapping the painful memories of the chaotic Cultural Revolution to turn public opinion against the students. But students reject any comparison of their campaign with the ultra-leftist 1966-76 movement, during which the nation was plunged into turmoil by young Red Guards unleashed by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in a power struggle. Conservative leaders including Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in recent days have increased pressure on students to stop their 6-week-old protests. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday published a letter from seven unidentified intellectuals who chillingly warned of a new Cultural Revolution if the protests did not cease. `` Our middle-aged generation who walked away from the Cultural Revolution purgatory still can painfully and clearly remember the lawlessness and turmoil of those 10 years,'' they wrote. `` The national economy was on the verge of ruin ... there was no peace in the party, the country or anywhere.'' `` We ask all comrades who in those 10 years of catastrophic terror lost loved ones, wasted their youth and suffered hardship to call on their sense of responsibility to history and society,'' the letter said. `` Warn your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat of this tragedy of history.'' Chinese in their 30s and older have vivid memories of communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s darkest decade, when <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> mobilized millions of youth to save his revolution from entrenched bureaucrats. His Red Guards ruled the streets for two years before the army was called in to restore order. Gangs of youths tore down temples and churches, burned books, seized government ministries, ransacked homes and persecuted intellectuals. Estimates of deaths from political turmoil during the decade are as high as 1 million. Millions more were persecuted and their lives destroyed. Students who have joined this spring's protests are quick to point that their approach is different. This year's demonstrations have been peaceful. Students have gone out of their way to ensure their marches and sit-ins are orderly. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s citizens have reacted not with fear but with heartfelt support, donating money and food to the protesting students. `` We have been calm and orderly,'' said a 22-year-old senior from <ORGANIZATION> Nanjing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` If there's turmoil, you can say it's created by the government.'' The government cracked down on the protests by declaring martial law on May 20, but leadership divisions over how to deal with the students created a bitter power struggle. The conservatives appear to have toppled moderate <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who reportedly is under house arrest. A diplomatic source says party documents accuse <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of helping incite demonstrations and of using the student movement in a bid to seize power. The student protesters reject comparison to the Red Guards, who were called to the streets by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> as his followers. `` I think that up to now, our student movement has not been exploited by anyone,'' said a senior from <ORGANIZATION> Puyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province. He and other students argue their movement is of the masses, not of a government faction. Although all Chinese share horrific memories of the Cultural Revolution, not all share the concern that history is poised to repeat itself. `` This time the people want democracy,'' said a 41-year-old mathematics professor from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who was in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to support the students. `` A second Cultural Revolution ca n't come. I am not afraid.''

<HEAD>City Loses Bid to Block Resumption of Pipeline Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge Tuesday rejected a request by city officials that he prohibit a pipeline company from resuming operation of a fuel line that blew up in a deadly fireball last week. City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayashima </PERSON>'s decision had been expected. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> attorney has unsuccessfully sought to block the <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from resuming pipeline operations or to persuade <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> executives to relocate the 14-inch diameter fuel line away from city residents. The devastating explosion, fueled by unleaded gasoline being pumped through the line, killed two people and injured dozens more last Thursday. A federal investigation into the cause has focused on the possibility that the pipe was damaged by the wreck of a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight train, which derailed in the same area May 12. Calnev attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said the federal government, not local government, has sole authority to regulate interstate commerce, including products shipped by pipeline. <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> has moved aggressively to establish federal jurisdiction in the case. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, another Calnev attorney, told <PERSON> Kayashima </PERSON> that the fuel company had every intention of abiding by regulations set by the federal Office of Pipeline Safety. The company will not open the pipeline without OPS approval, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> complained, `` We're having a very difficult time trying to get Calnev to comply with federal laws and to get OPS to comply with federal laws.'' But in issuing his decision, the judge said the 1979 Hazardous Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 gives the Office of Pipeline Safety authority to determine pipeline safety. In a related development in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> sought a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order that would effectively force the city to allow the company to reopen the pipeline in accordance with federal regulations. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> obtained a similar federal order prohibiting city officials from interfering with the repair and replacement of the damaged 14-inch diameter pipeline. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> vowed to continue the fight, but conceded the city faces an uphill battle.

<TEXT>
 Granted, it was a less-than-elegant paraphrase of the solemn pronouncement of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Sixteen heads of state in summit conference assembled, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summarizes a line of their communique as `` blah, blah.'' But no offense intended. He was just skipping over words, hurrying to get to the heavy stuff. And nobody cared more about the heavy stuff than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, by his account, a double hit. He did keep reminding himself, out loud, that this was good for the alliance, not only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, president thereof. After weeks of taking flak while Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took bows for his arms-control offensive, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had his own, dramatic proposal in place, with the blessings of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. His euphoria was showing. At a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> news conference, the president was asked why his arms offer did n't seek to eliminate nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said repeatedly that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> proposes to reduce nuclear weaponry, not go to zero. `` Well,'' he said, `` the communique addresses itself to where nuclear forces are concerned'' _ and stopped reading the text. `` Blah, blah,'' he abbreviated. `` Land, sea, air-based systems, including ground-based missiles _ in the present circumstances as far as can be foreseen, they'll be needed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' And when will the alliance get rolling with a specific negotiating offer on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan? The president lapsed into NATO-speak: `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is tasked to be back on September 7th, with our internals to be farther along. `` ... We all remember September 7th, do n't we?'' he asked, and laughed. That's the day the campaigning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pronounced to be Pearl Harbor Day, three months ahead of the real one on December 7. He also laughed when asked whether his attitude toward the critics is now `` I told you so.'' `` Not really,'' he said. `` Not really. No, listen, I'm not going to get into that game with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or anyone else.'' But it was n't the only game in town, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was so enthusiastic he even waived his rule against talking to reporters at photo-taking sessions, briefly, on Tuesday. `` We'll make an exception ... just to say, yes, I'm very pleased ... It was a united alliance; plenty of credit for everybody there.'' That was at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s exit was briefly delayed when he tried to make his way through the middle of a brown curtain that had no opening in it. He flailed briefly, then went around end. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, he rated the summit `` marvelous.'' At the Chancellery in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, he said it had been good for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, good for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, good for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and could be good for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, too. Was the president feeling up? `` Have you ever seen him down?'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as they flew to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` You are a friend among friends,'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told the president in welcome. He'd been in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, too, and got back shortly before the ceremony. Never mind the weeks of friction between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over German demands for quick negotiations seeking cutbacks in short-range nuclear missiles. `` I told him that I do n't believe German-American relations have ever been better,'' the president said. The short-range missile compromise may yet come back to haunt <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> politically, although he said Tuesday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit would be a boost in the 1990 West German elections. Maybe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s upbeat mood about the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit was catching. `` There are only winners,'' said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who, if he was one, certainly did n't win much.

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has disclosed a level of military spending nearly four times as high as the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has admitted in the past, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts say his estimate is still low though likely to rise as economic reforms continue in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> figure seems quite short,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> analyst who has published numerous studies on Soviet military spending. Another U.S.-based expert on the Soviet economy, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Planecon </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s figure is `` kind of low'' and `` raises more questions than it answers.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in what was hailed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a breakthrough for `` glasnost,'' or openness, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> spends 77.3 billion rubles, or $ 118 billion per year at the rate of exchange set by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, compared with the figure of $ 32 billion announced by Soviet officials last October. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimates Soviet defense spending at 115 billion rubles to 125 billion rubles, and says that roughly equals the $ 300 billion that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spends annually, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, an expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That committee annually publishes the authoritative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysis of the Soviet economy by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Converting the ruble figure directly to dollars is virtually meaningless, the experts said, because the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> uses several rates of exchange and the Armed Forces have access to materials and devices that are simply not available to civilian enterprises. Moreover, they said, the ruble estimate likely will increase considerably when the Soviets carry through long-promised changes in wholesale prices. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, Vanous and other experts predicted that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement would fuel Soviet discussion on military spending, producing yet higher estimates and a lively political fight between reformers and conservatives `` The most important thing about the figure offered by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is not the number itself but the debate that it is going to start in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON> compared arguments raging over the Soviet spending deficit, which was disclosed for the first time last October after the Kremlin for years had claimed to have a balanced budget. Since last fall, the figure has been revised upward by several noted Soviet economists, none of whom appear to have definitive figures, said <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not break down Soviet military spending by category, and his number did not appear to include research and development costs, estimated at more than 11 billion rubles by <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. The biggest discrepancy, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts, is that Soviet military prices are based on artificially low production costs rather than the true market value of goods. `` The Soviets have an acute shortage of micro-computers,'' <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON> said by way of example. `` It is impossible to get them in the civilian sector. If there was a meaningful market, the price would be quite high.'' `` The micro-computers that go into MiG -LRB- fighters -RRB- do n't cost very much, but there are enterprises in the civilian economy that would be willing to bid five or six times as much'' as the military pays for them, said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>, a Czechoslovakian emigre whose firm specializes in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> economies. The military also consumes expensive metal alloys that simply are unavailable to the rest of the economy, he said. Moreover, there are numerous hidden military costs, such as armaments sold to client states on favorable terms or the extensive civil defense system, including hardening of some subway lines against nuclear attack, which are not included in the defense budget, said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` number makes it clear that the government lied in the past,'' said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. `` It lied a lot in the past and now it will lie a little bit. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement has legitimized debate on this issue.'' Soviet reformers have been pressing the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for more than a year to provide a more accurate accounting. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said defense spending would be cut by 13 percent and the savings channeled into social services, a course advocated by the reformers. According to the figure provided by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviets spend about 9 percent of their gross national product on defense. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the Soviets spend 15 percent to 17 percent of GNP, compared with 6 percent for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is twice as large as that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the superpowers' spending is not far apart, said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> makes its estimates by observing Soviet military production and activities, then calculating what they should cost, said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 From socialist <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, traditionally wary of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, to conservative <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, eagle-eyed for any sign of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> isolationism, the Europeans are crediting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with seizing back the arms control initiative for the West. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit marked an impressive debut with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s often restive West European allies. Gone are the grumblings about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s getting off to a slow start, leaving foreign policy vaccuums and letting Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hog the stage. And the plaudits were a good deal more than official courtesy demanded. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a very sympathetic man. ... He looks toward <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he has a feeling for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he is an understanding ally,'' <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told a news conference at the end of the two-day summit Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored his biggest hit by unveiling sweeping proposals for big cuts in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet troops strengths and conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The initiative, presented as a challenge to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, could end the much-feared Soviet superiority in conventional weapons. It also was a major factor in pushing the divided Europeans into an agreement on the future of short-range nuclear missiles, by tying negotiations to the implementation of an accelerated conventional arms agreement. Even British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has said in the past that any cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would send the wrong signal to the Soviets, welcomed the prospect of troop reductions to 275,000 soldiers each. Along with the other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, she said the plan had been the key factor in averting a deadlock over the future of short-range nuclear missiles. Immediately after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled the offer in a closed-door meeting of the allies, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the president had `` transformed the summit.'' `` His leadership set the tone for the whole meeting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. With a last-minute compromise, the allies agreed to superpower negotiations to reduce the weapons, but only on strict conditions linked to progress on both getting and carrying out conventional arms cuts. `` I think he has given a very clear lead,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` But I never had much doubt about the quality of -LRB- his -RRB- leadership. I much prefer a leader to be measured rather than dashing into things. ... In the long run you get policies right.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who had an exceptionally close relationship with former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, appeared at the summit to strike a good personal note with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Because of the alphabetical arrangement _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ the two leaders sat next to each other throughout the summit and usually left meetings chatting together. British officials said they had no sense that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals to withdraw some American troops reflected a desire for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to loosen the costly ties that now bind it to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s defense. `` We saw it seizing back the arms control initiative ... and that's not to be sneezed at,'' said a senior British official. Said Spanish Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>: `` European unity is reaffirmed.'' For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, it seemed, at least for now, things could not have gone better. `` I was elected to do what I think is right,'' he said. `` I have been told by others here that the allies really have never had a meeting that is more upbeat. ... Whatever political arrows may have been fired my way, it's all been worth it.''

<HEAD>Anti-Nuke Report Includes Signs of Improving Plant Performance</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report by an anti-nuclear group that spotlights the worst-run commercial reactors may inadvertently give the industry some solace. Public Citizen's <ORGANIZATION> Critical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which advocates a phased shutdown of the nuclear industry, issued a `` Nuclear Lemons'' report Tuesday identifying what it called the 20 least safe and economic nuclear power reactors. The report, based on government and industry documents mostly for 1987 and 1988 activity, said six of the 10 worst reactors were in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. It said these pose a public health risk and should be shut down permanently. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses and monitors safety at all commercial reactors, declined comment on the report. The commission is due Thursday to issue its regular semi-annual report on the worst-run nuclear plants. The Public Citizen report, while identifying the industry's weak performers, also contained information that points to some overall improvement in safety. For example, it reported that <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Fermi-2 reactor, situated near <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, ranked fifth-worst in the industry, based in part on the number of its emergency shutdowns over the past two years. The plant was forced to temporarily shut down seven times in 1987 and five times last year. That is a substantial improvement, however, over its record as described in Public Citizen's 1988 `` Nuclear Lemons'' report that also rated Fermi-2 fifth-worst overall. That report said Fermi-2 had 30 emergency shutdowns in 1985 and eight the following year. Also, this year's report said the 1987-88 industry average for emergency shutdowns was 3.5, compared with a 7.4 percent average for the previous two years. Public Citizen's figures also showed that the total amount of radiation to which workers were exposed at the worst-performing plants in 1987 was down by about 20 percent from the average exposure level at the worst reactors in last year's report. The economics of nuclear power, however, did not show a similar improvement. This year's report said the average operating and maintenance costs at the least efficient reactors averaged $ 72 per kilowatt of power generated in 1987, the latest year for which such data was available. Last year's report cited a $ 65-per-kilowatt average for 1986. Public Citizen said the No. 3 reactor at the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> nuclear station near <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was the worst in the industry, based mainly on a low rating for plant management and a relatively high incidence of `` forced outages,'' or unplanned shutdowns. The No. 4 reactor at the same station was rated 10th worst. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounds </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> reactors, said the report masked a `` vast improvement'' in the plants' performance in 1988. He said, for example, that the number of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> regulatory violations fell to 29 last year from 37 the year before. Pounds said Public Citizen used `` a grab bag list of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> reports'' to reach its conclusions. `` I would characterize it as perhaps a distorted view of nuclear performance that is designed to create fear and apprehension among the public,'' he said. Public Citizen rated each nuclear reactor on 10 different indicators of economy and safety. Included on Public Citizen's list is the problem-plagued Rancho Seco plant, near <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the object of more <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspections over the last three years than any of the nation's other 109 operating reactors <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> residents vote next week on whether to permanently shut Rancho Seco. The report said six reactors ranked among the worst in six of the 10 categories. In addition to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Point No. 3 and Rancho Seco, these were Oyster Creek No. 1, of <LOCATION> Forked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; the No. 2 and 3 units at Peach Bottom, in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and the Fermi-2 plant near <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Public Citizen said four reactors scored among the worst in five of its categories These were <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> units 1 and 2, near <LOCATION> Daisy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; the Pilgrim No. 1 reactor near <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Point No. 4 reactor.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A technique for infecting white rabbits with the AIDS virus has been developed by federal scientists, providing researchers with a laboratory animal to test drugs and vaccines for combating the fatal disease. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Infectious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that because of the new technique, laboratories everywhere will be able to use the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> white rabbit as a model for studying infections of the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Research into AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has been severely handicapped because there has been no animal model to test treatment agents for the disease. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said the rabbit now can provide that model. `` If you inject this animal with human cells infected with HIV, the infection will take in the rabbit,'' he said. Within four weeks after the injection, the rabbit's immune system starts showing signs of reacting to the virus, a finding that is called seroconversion. Once this has occurred, <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said the rabbit could be used to test drug treatments for the disease. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said the rabbit could also be used to test candidate AIDS vaccines. `` We could inject the rabbit with the vaccine and then after a period of time challenge it with the HIV cells and see if it reacted to the virus,'' he said. Until now, the chimpanzee has been the only non-human animal that can contract true AIDS and, thus, could be used as a model for studying the disease. But chimps are becoming increasing rare and now typically cost up to $ 60,000 each, said <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> white rabbits cost about $ 40 each and a good breeding pair can produce up to three litters a year, generally with eight rabbits per litter. `` A very immediate and urgent need exists for thousands of experimental animals to test promising agents already used effectively -LRB- in test tubes -RRB- and others proposed for use against AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has announced that there are at least 100 anti-AIDS drugs, vaccines and other agents that are stalled in development because there is no appropriate animal model available for testing. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said that the rabbit, when exposed to HIV, develops some of the classic human symptoms of AIDS, including enlarged lymph, spleen and thymus glands and a decline in the numbers of healthy T-cells, one of the immune system cells. Typically, he said, a rabbit infected with AIDS can live for about a year, unless it develops a major secondary infection, which is common because AIDS destroys the immune system. Uninfected rabbits, said <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON>, will live up to five years. The method of giving the rabbit AIDS involves injecting it with about five million infected human cells. Seroconversion follows in about four weeks. The process can be speeded up, said <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON>, by the injection of about 50 million infected human cells. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said that new studies need to be conducted to see if a rabbit infected with the AIDS virus can spread the disease to other rabbits through sexual intercourse, a common way of spreading the disease among humans. He said tests have shown that AIDS can be spread between the laboratory animals by injecting blood from an infected rabbit into another rabbit. AIDS is often spread among human drug users who share needles or syringes. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> led a team of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> scientists that developed the technique to infect the laboratory rabbits. Others on the team are Dr. <PERSON> Henrietta </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulaga </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Folks </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Rosamond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>. A license to commercially produce the laboratory rabbit for AIDS research has been given to <ORGANIZATION> RRI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a newly organized company, by the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said the company plans to produce about 3,000 rabbits annually at a biologically secure laboratory in <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>, Md. Other facilities are to be built later in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to make the animal available to researchers worldwide.

 Democratic congressional leaders who had fretted at the slow pace of the new administration's foreign policy formulation now are singing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s praises for his initiatives on arms control at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. What had been a chorus of criticism turned into a crescendo of applause Tuesday as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerged from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance solidly behind the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal on conventional arms cuts, and united again on short-range nuclear missile strategy. `` We may be at an important turning point in history, one in which the security environment in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can be transformed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` The specter of war which has haunted that continent throughout the 20th century may be receding,'' said <PERSON> Michell </PERSON>, who previously had criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as slow to respond to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s disarmament initiatives. `` The president hit all the right chords with his proposals on conventional arms reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said, `` the agreement seems to guard against denuclearization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which was his and -LRB- British Prime Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s greatest fear.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, long a watchdog of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, added there could be `` substantial'' savings for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> convinces the Soviets to buy his plan for deep troop cuts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal underscores `` the dangerous Soviet conventional -LRB- weapons -RRB- advantages'' and gives <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> a `` sound negotiating position. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I applaud and very much support the president's decision to move along this path.'' `` I trust that this proposal will be approved by our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and by the Soviets,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now have created `` a once-in-a-century opportunity to transform the East-West security relationship. `` With his latest proposals, the president has shown that he is convinced that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is ready to change the military balance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and that he is willing to commit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to be an active partner in this process,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put `` a very substantive'' conventional arms proposal on the table, along with `` a politically necessary'' nuclear proposal `` He has demonstrated an understanding of the dynamic at work in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in terms of responding to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. Moreover, the president has silenced, at least for the moment, those who criticized his allegedly dilatory start in coming to grips with the challenge poised by the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> inititives, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` The time had nearly run out and I think he took it right up to the wire,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` But I think it's sort of a vindication for him.''

 The military seems to be proving every cloud has a silver lining, even when the cloud is created by a destroyed missile. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday offered a `` good news'' story, although it looked like some stretching. The military frequently criticizes the press for reporting only `` bad news'' stories, ignoring all the good things that happen inside today's armed forces. Recall, first, that on May 11 the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> conducted the first test flight of the new Midgetman long-range nuclear missile. The missile had to be destroyed by a range safety officer when it went out of control, apparently because of a second-stage rocket nozzle malfunction. Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issued a press release that began: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> announced today the first flight of the -LRB- Midgetman -RRB- achieved almost 85 percent of its mission objectives, instead of the previously announced 50 percent.'' It seems that staying up in the air is only 15 percent of the objective.

<HEAD>Sailor Named in Insurance Policy Blames Inexperience for Iowa Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sailor named as beneficiary of a life-insurance policy of a buddy who died in the explosion aboard the USS Iowa says many of the crew working in the gun turret where the blast occurred lacked experience and had never worked together. Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday the crew was hastily assembled before the April 19 exercise and gun turret No. 2 was undermanned by as many as 30 positions. `` The gun crew never worked together. This was to be their first shoot,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said a number of experienced crew members did not report for duty and were replaced with less experienced sailors. `` Some of the people that were missing had relatively key places and possibly inexperienced people had to be put in their jobs to fill them,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said his friend <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, the crew head killed in the blast, was assigned to participate in the exercise at the last minute. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s captain, has said his best gun crew manned the No. 2 turret. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has also said such crews are not always fully staffed during peacetime exercises. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, suggested the explosion that killed 47 sailors may have occurred when an inexperienced sailor pushed bags of gun powder too quickly into the magazine of the gun. Pushing the bags too quickly against the projectile could cause friction and heat that could spark an explosion, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said the sailor assigned that job was barely qualified for the position. `` I want the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to tell us he was qualified, and was tested and instructed in this delicate job,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. He declined to release the name of the deceased sailor. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials he believed the explosion was sparked by a too rapid a loading of the powder bags. The attorney also suggested that the gunpowder in the bags was volatile because it had been improperly subjected to high temperatures during storage. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged the powder was not properly stored but said chemical tests indicated faulty storage had not made it more explosive. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> demanded an apology from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for news leaks he said falsely linked his client to a murder-suicide plot with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. `` We are asking from an identified spokesman in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, that they clear this gunner mate's name,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. According to published reports, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has investigated the relationship between <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who named his friend as sole beneficiary in a $ 50,000 double-indemnity life-insurance policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, however, issued a statement saying that it has made no official finding `` regarding possible culpability, nor made any allegations concerning any individual as it relates to the explosion which occurred aboard the USS Iowa on April 19, and considers actions of that nature to be premature, speculative and not in the best interests of the naval service or any of the people or families involved.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it would release findings of its investigation when it was completed.

 A reporter for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says he was fired for refusing to let his bosses look at a book he is writing about the news service. `` I'm outraged, but not surprised,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who had been a <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> reporter for nearly 18 years, much of it as the service's chief investigative reporter. `` We asked to see the manuscript, not to censor it,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was dismissed because he refused to assure <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> that the book he is writing about <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> is beneficial to the company and that it was not a conflict of interest between him and <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> said a conflict of interest would be if <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> `` were writing something derogatory about <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> is co-author of the book, `` Down to the Wire,'' with <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who was fired three years ago as <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s managing editor. The book, to be published next January, describes `` the last decade of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s fight for survival,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said that on his return from his honeymoon in early May, he was asked the status of the book by <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON>. A week later, he said, he received a letter asking either for a review of the manuscript or `` a written declaration that it contains nothing derogatory about <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, its managment or its ownership.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said the news service's managment knew he and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> were writing the book, for which 200 people _ mostly present and former employees of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> _ were interviewed. `` I told him the book was written by two people who had a combined 43 years with <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> and we were very sympathetic to the institution,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` He said they needed to see the manuscript. I told <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, that I was shocked that a wire service that for years fought for the First Amendment, would follow such a course.''

 <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> liberated the Holy Grail from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and delivered a treasure to box offices across the country: a record $ 46.9 million in ticket sales in its first six days. `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and The Last Crusade,'' the third and presumably final installment in the adventures of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s archaeologist, also toppled records for week, weekend and single-day admissions, according to figures released Tuesday `` It's been fantastic,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, assistant manager of downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s Sameric 4. `` On opening day, we had people lining up at 8:30 a.m. for the 8 p.m. show. First time I've ever seen that for a movie. `` I have n't been home since last Wednesday,'' when the consistently sold-out show opened, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrino </PERSON>, manager of the Loews 34th Street Showplace in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, regional marketing manager for General Cinema Theaters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said `` The Last Crusade'' was going `` like gangbusters _ they love it.'' It was being shown in 11 of the company's area theaters. `` The Last Crusade,'' which opened May 24 on 2,327 screens, set a mark for the largest single-day gate in movie history, selling $ 11.2 million in admissions on Saturday alone. For the four-day Memorial Day weekend, it grossed $ 37 million. By comparison, last year's mega-hit `` Rain Man'' collected $ 7 million in its opening three-day weekend. The previous six-day record-holder, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Temple of Doom,'' gathered $ 42.3 million in 1984 and drew $ 45.7 million for its first full week, also the previous mark. The former single-day mark was held by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 hit `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II,'' which sold $ 9.7 million its first Saturday and $ 33 million in its opening four-day weekend. `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' took second on last weekend's box-office charts with $ 6.1 million, followed by `` Field of Dreams'' in third with $ 5.7 million and `` Road House'' in fourth with $ 5 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> In fifth place was the most immediate victim of `` The Last Crusade'' assault, <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s new movie `` Pink Cadillac,'' which opened last weekend with $ 4.4 million. In sixth was `` K-9'' with $ 3.1 million, `` Pet Sematary'' in seventh with $ 2.6 million, `` Major League'' in eighth with $ 1.4 million. The Oscar-favorite `` Rain Man'' finished in ninth with $ 1.2 million, bringing its box-office receipts to $ 165.3 million after 24 weeks. `` Scandal'' finished in 10th with $ 1 million. `` The Last Crusade's'' fortunes were boosted by a barrage of holiday vacationers and higher ticket prices in many of the country's movie houses. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, for example, some theaters charged $ 7, a dollar more than usual. No matter how high the price or how long the wait, audiences were determined to see <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s Indy save the Holy Grail _ said to be the chalice used by <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> at the Last Supper _ from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. At theaters in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, lines for `` The Last Crusade'' snaked around the block throughout the weekend. At the <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alex </ORGANIZATION> theater in nearby <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, the flood of fans drained the concessions stand of ice, hot dog buns and change. The wait for late-night screenings in suburban theaters approached an hour. Audiences at some theaters cheered even the movie's opening credits, greeted <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s first appearance with whoops of joy and heartily applauded the introduction of co-star <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, who portrayed <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s father. At the <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> 3 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, extra midnight shows were added. `` We turned people away from every show,'' said manager <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott-Hall </PERSON>. `` It's been sold out since last Wednesday.'' `` It's just an extraordinary accomplishment for the movie,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s motion picture group, which produced `` The Last Crusade.'' `` People were just having a great time with the movie.'' The phenomenal opening for `` The Last Crusade'' gives Paramount early control of this summer's box-office sweepstakes, considered the most competitive in movie history. To capitalize on the weekend's packed houses, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> attached preview trailers for its upcoming `` Star Trek V'' and `` Black Rain'' to `` The Last Crusade'' prints. Forty percent of all movie grosses usually come between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Last summer's season was worth $ 1.6 billion, and this summer is seen as potentially even more lucrative. Expectations are high for `` Ghostbusters II,'' opening June 16; `` Batman,'' opening June 23; and `` The Abyss,'' coming July 19. `` The Last Crusade'' is being advertised as the final <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> chapter. `` As far as we know, it's still the last movie,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said.

 With springtime's tardy entrance to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the dreaded black flies have started buzzing by, and folks who stay outdoors are hunting for ways to avoid the blood-drawing bites. `` They kind of tend to drive you foolish,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> extension specialist in pest management. `` They come in swarms and have a tendency to swarm around your head. They seem to like to bite where clothing fits tightly, like if you've got a sleeve, they like to burrow in and bite there. `` Of course, they'll bite everywhere,'' <PERSON> Dill </PERSON> said. Black-fly experts and victims in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> say their state may suffer more of the pests than any other in the region, although <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> state entomologist Ziegfried Thewke said the flies can be a nuisance throughout all northern states, and even in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thewke </PERSON> said there is no way to tell how many black flies will infest an area in a given year. Other experts say years of low moisture may have fewer flies, although they will always be present. The flies are at their worst in wooded areas with lots of clean, running water. And they are faster than mosquitoes when it comes to biting. `` A black fly will come whizzing along and land and attack, quickly,'' <PERSON> Thewke </PERSON> said, adding that a few types of black flies give the whole group a bad name. `` There are 30 some species of black flies here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but only four of them bite humans,'' he said. The first few tend to come out in early May, and the swarm can be in full swing toward the end of the month, sometimes hanging around as late as November. `` Sometimes we just have to wear bug nets, head nets, gloves, longsleeve shirts and insect repellent, naturally,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moring </PERSON>, an associate professor of zoology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you're new in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, or a baby, sometimes you get a worse reaction.'' The insect repellent, called `` fly dope'' in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, can have its bad side effects, however. For example, some types melt plastic. `` If you have plastic lenses on your glasses, you can find your fingerprints on them, and you can find your hands sticking to the steering wheel,'' <PERSON> Moring </PERSON> said. People fight the flies in many other ways, with varying degrees of success. `` I do n't condone this, but a lot of people will smoke big cigars,'' <PERSON> Moring </PERSON> said. `` The smoke keeps them away.'' Others use B vitamins or yeast tablets, believed by some to make the body odor unattractive to the flies. At the <LOCATION> Sugarloaf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> resort in western <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, officials have taken a more aggressive approach. They brought in hungry bats and built small bat houses near the golf course. `` We call them ` bat condominiums,''' said <ORGANIZATION> Sugarbush </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. `` We put the bats in last year. They ate a lot.''

 The body of Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> will lie in state in the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rotunda </LOCATION> as a tribute to a half-century political career in which he championed the elderly and the poor, his former colleagues promise. Pepper's political odyssey, one of the longest in American history, ended Tuesday with his death at age 88. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat who served as a state representative before his election to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1936, Pepper later served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after 12 years out of office and became its oldest member. `` He was always a voice for the voiceless and a helping hand for the helpless,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will adopt a resolution today so that Pepper can lie in state Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was also expected to approve the resolution today, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Lying in state in the <LOCATION> Rotunda </LOCATION> is the highest final honor an American can receive. It has been accorded presidents, and more recently to the unknown soldier from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. Pepper had been hospitalized since April 6 suffering from an undisclosed stomach ailment, which a spokesman in his office said Tuesday was cancer. He died at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he returned a month ago after an interim stay at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Pepper's colleagues said he used his opportunities to the hilt, and to the service of his least powerful constituents. `` In the bosom of that small, gentle man beat the heart of a giant _ a heart that felt the pain of a world where children go to sleep hungry and where the old die alone,'' Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., said `` He was not just a witness to the century, he helped shape the century,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chief deputy whip of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Pepper, born Sept. 8, 1900, on a farm near <LOCATION> Dudleyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, rose from poverty to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he was an architect of some of the nation's most enduring `` safety net'' programs, including Social Security, the minimum wage, and medical assistance for the elderly and for handicapped children. He was the first national legislator to push publicly for federal funding for the war against cancer, a disease that took his wife, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> in 1979, some 43 years after they were married. They had no children. In his final years, he dug in his heels against cutting <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> benefits to elderly retired workers _ half a century after campaigning for establishment of the retirement program. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who presented Pepper with the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, during a hospital visit last Thursday, offered this summing up from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>: `` <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> gave definition and meaning to the concept of public service. He fought for the poor and the elderly in his own determined way. `` Those who agreed with him were proud to follow his banner. Those who disagreed with him always respected him. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> was a gentleman, a noble human being.'' Others noted Pepper's extraordinary length of public service, beginning with his election to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in 1928 at age 28. He went to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> four years into the administration of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. Defeated for re-election in 1950, he taught and practiced law until his election in 1962 to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> district. Pepper, who early on perceived the threat posed by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, earned <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s undying affection for casting the only vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the Lend-Lease Act the first time around. But his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career ended in 1950 after a campaign which saw him branded as `` Red Pepper'' _ playing on claims during the communist scare of the era that he was soft on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that Pepper had chaired since 1983, said the ailing congressman `` obviously was wracked with pain but was able to bring himself together'' during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presentation of the Medal of Freedom He said Pepper spoke for 10 minutes on how public service had been the passion of his life. <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, who also was with Pepper when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented the medal, said the congressman had summoned his staff to his hospital bed to brief him on pending legislation and casework immediately after the ceremony. `` <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> was a fighter, and he died fighting,'' <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging which Pepper once headed, said Pepper will be remembered as `` one of the country's most beloved and renowned defenders and champions of millions of elderly Americans.

 A sightseeing helicopter struck the wires supporting a moving cable car about 200 feet above the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but no were reported. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> teams were expected to arrive today to investigate Tuesday evening's accident, which occurred above the churning <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based helicopter carrying three tourists and pilot <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Felderstein </PERSON> passed within 250 feet of the Spanish Aero Car, struck the cables and sheared off its landing gear. The impact swayed the cable car that was carrying 17 passengers, but it returned safely to its base. <PERSON> Felderstein </PERSON> landed the copter safely on a golf course. Cable car tour guide <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnsley </PERSON> said he noticed the low-flying craft for several minutes before the impact. `` I was thinking it was very odd for him to be flying down that low,'' <ORGANIZATION> Barnsley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Nobody's ever down that low. `` The next thing we know, there was this impact and the landing gear just shattered into a million pieces and dropped down into the gorge. It all happened in seconds.'' <ORGANIZATION> Barnsley </ORGANIZATION> said the cable car swayed for perhaps a half-minute, but no one was in danger of being tossed from the open-air coach and no debris came near the car. `` I thought he -LRB- the helicopter pilot -RRB- was gone, but he pulled it back up. It was amazing he could control it so well,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Barnsley </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Felderstein </PERSON> piloted the craft about 100 yards inland to the <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> and allowed the passengers to jump a few feet to the ground before the helicopter landed safely on the 10th fairway. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, general manager of Rainbow Helicopter, said the 25-year-old <PERSON> Felderstein </PERSON> has been employed by the company for about four months and has three years' flying experience.

 Government sources say the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is looking into allegations of a no-show employee in the office of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, but the fourth-ranking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrat denied any wrongdoing and questioned the timing of news leaks about the probe. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents are conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations dealing with personnel and expenditures in the office of the prominent <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrat, said the sources, who spoke Tuesday night on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who is seeking the post of majority whip in a leadership shuffle that hinges on the expected resignation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, denied at a news conference Tuesday night that he was a `` target'' or `` subject'' of a probe. He also disputed a televised report that he had declined to cooperate with agents in a criminal investigation. The sources stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> did not know whether its preliminary inquiry would lead to a full-scale criminal investigation, and said the purpose of a Memorial Day meeting with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was to advise him of the inquiry. One source said the allegations involved a `` ghost employee.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> came to his home in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, but he said, `` I was told over and over again that I was not under investigation.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he was cryptically told only that `` the bureau was looking into allegations about an employee or employees, and that they had been looking into these allegations for the past four to five months.'' He said, `` We pledged to provide any materials or documents to assist in this investigation,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he was asking Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> today to initiate an independent counsel investigation to determine who leaked information about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> visit. `` All I can say to you and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is you be the judge as to the motives of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leaks,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` You be the judge as to the timing. You be the judge as to what the agenda is.'' Chief <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said he could not discuss `` anything that has been reported about Mr. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> or any of Mr. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s comments.'' In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> also declined comment. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> replied `` You bet!'' in answer to q question of whether he would still be seeking the majority whip position being vacated by Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I have done nothing wrong,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said Aides to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said privately that they were `` in the dark'' about nature of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, and that they had concocted a number of theories _ including one that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> might have been contacted in connection with an already existing probe on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, not a new one. But the aides declined to elaborate, and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON> said, `` We do n't know what to expect to happen next.'' After the news conference, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and his aides met in his office until after 11 p.m. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the highest ranking black in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, appeared on a CBS program Sunday and said he was confident the Democratic congressional leadership, recently rocked by ethical problems of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and a questionable financial deal involving <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, was headed for better times. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> announced on Saturday that he will leave the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on June 15. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> may resign possibly as early as today. The pastor of a Baptist church that his father also led, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 47, is a powerful political figure in his native <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He runs his campaign committee as a virtual bank for local Democratic candidates whom he supports. His 1988 committee reported loans of $ 25,000, $ 20,000 and $ 15,000 for three city council candidates, as well as a $ 15,000 loan to the re-election effort of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>. First elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from one of the nation's most impoverished districts in 1978, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> headed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for four years before assuming the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus post this year.

 Fellow Marines and relatives waited anxiously for news of the 14 men missing after a helicopter crash during a training mission off <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. `` There is a great somberness and pain with reports of the tragedy or possible tragedy.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> hates a loser, and no politician seems more scorned these days than <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The failed Democratic presidential candidate is the butt of jokes in his home state. Question: `` What does <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mean in Greek?'' Answer: `` <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also is facing a huge state budget deficit, a cranky <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, a wife recovering from alcoholism and the lowest popularity ratings of his career. When his car was stopped for an expired registration sticker recently, his driver was given a warning instead of the usual $ 50 fine. A radio station sold cardboard cutouts of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying ordinary people could avoid tickets, too, if only they had a governor in the back seat. Now, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company has started an advertisement showing a photo of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> giving a speech. `` There are some people even we could n't make more persuasive'' reads the huge caption. Fortune magazine declined to run the ad by <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but the two-page spread appears in the latest <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> editions of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> magazines. The creators insist the ad is n't meant to demean <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In fact, the two people who came up with the idea supported him in his bid for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and one even campaigned for him, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandelbaum </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mandelbaum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mooney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But lest the ad be overlooked, the year-old agency that has also made controversial ads showing nudists and underwear sent a copy of its <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> piece to news organizations. A spokesman for the governor said the unauthorized use of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' photograph to sell a product `` shows a lack of common sense and decency.'' The ad pushes a product that can make a photographic slide from the image on the screen of a personal computer. `` It's something that will allow anyone to make more persuasive presentations,'' the text reads. `` We were sitting around talking about who was a poor presenter, who could n't get his points across, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the guy who leapt into mind,'' <PERSON> Mandelbaum </PERSON> said. The only other candidate considered was <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister remembered for his appeasement of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. But they decided few people would recognize <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mandelbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. But <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, the governor's chief legal counsel, said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law prohibits use of a person's photograph for advertising or commercial purposes without their consent. `` That law reflects common sense and decency,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` One would hope that any company would show restraint in using someone's likeness for commercial purposes and that any magazine would take steps to determine whether consent has been given before they ran it.'' <PERSON> Mandelbaum </PERSON> said there had been some debate about the legality of using the photograph. `` I think the company looked at the risks and accepted them,'' he said. Fortune spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Belis </PERSON> said the magazine would not discuss its reasons for rejecting the ad. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunhorst </PERSON>, national advertising manager for <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't think the ad was derogatory, just trying to make a point. `` In the past, advertisers have used pictures of presidents that were derogatory,'' Thunhorst said. `` They flayed <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> pretty good.'' <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON> called the ad demeaning. `` That, after all, was the knock on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, that he was a poor campaigner who could n't get the message across,'' he said. <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON>'s polls of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters last month show that 53 percent have an unfavorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and 41 percent have a favorable view. A national survey in early April showed 39 percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> unfavorable and 44 percent favorable, he said. `` In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> there's a tremendous amount of Duke-bashing going on,'' he said. `` Nationally, there was some lessening of derision, because it's basically out of sight, out of mind.'' <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON> said the public is used to having political figures lampooned. `` It's sort of a sad commentary,'' <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON> said. `` If it's OK to bash <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the incumbent vice president, nightly, as he is bashed, then I guess it's OK to bash the loser. `` But to me it's like, leave the poor guy alone already.''

<HEAD>Opposition Claims Regime is Holding 89 Political Prisoners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition says the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> is holding at least 89 political prisoners. `` The prisoners are nothing more than hostages,'' opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. The Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commanded by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` take people prisoner for a while and then, if things are quiet, they just let them go,'' he said. `` They take people off the street, people who were just watching a parade.'' The opposition charges were the latest following the May 7 presidential election, which the government nullified three days later. International observers said the opposition, led by <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, won the election by a 3-1 margin. The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has criticized <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the vote nullification and the beating of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and two other opposition candidates. Opposition first vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said six people arrested May 24 while marching with opposition candidates to an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation meeting `` have not even been allowed to see their families.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> distributed a list of 89 people he said were political prisoners. It included opposition spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON>; legislative candidate <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>; <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>'s bodyguard; and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutrel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> election observer. Many prisoners were accused of threatening state security and sentenced to a year in jail the night of their arrest, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. He said such sentences often are converted into fines payable at the rate of $ 1 a day but inmates' relatives were told nobody is available to collect fines. Messages left for a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman for comment on <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>'s charges were not returned. The Defense Forces have not commented on the issue despite repeated requests.

 Transplant doctors predict pigs will become a main source of donor organs for people once the many technical problems of cross-species transplantation are resolved. While primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better match, pigs are cheaper, more plentiful and easier to breed, says Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, assistant professor of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` What could change, I suppose, is that we could become better at making artificial organs than we are now. Then we would n't need the animal organs. But I do n't see that as coming first,'' <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON> said Tuesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. Only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for all types of research, according to <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON>. `` It does n't make any sense to use chimpanzees because you're going to make such a small impact in the well-being of humans And you'll make people so mad, because it is where they focus from the point of view of animal rights, understandably so,'' he said. `` If you can eat the pig, I'm not sure you ca n't transplant the liver,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. But some animal-rights activists say they're opposed to using animals, whether it's chimpanzees, pigs or even rodents. `` Animals are n't here to be our spare parts,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who serves as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They're putting all their energy into this high-tech, incredibly expensive use of the limited resources we have to put into health care ... and it has maybe a one-in-10 million chance of ever working out,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, head of the research investigative committee for the Last Chance for Animals in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. About 30 animal-to-human organ transplants have been performed worldwide, most of them in the early 1960s, according to <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON>. The longest survivor was a 27-year-old woman who lived nine months with a chimpanzee's kidney she received in 1964. The latest patient, a 12-day-old girl known as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fae </PERSON>, died 20 days after receiving a baboon's heart in 1984 at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you define success as one-year survival, we still have n't gotten one,'' <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON> said `` But we've come awfully close.'' About 50 cases also are known in which doctors attached pigs' livers to coma patients on a temporary basis, mostly in the 1960s, <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON> said The patients' blood was passed through the pigs' livers, but it was not clear whether the animal organs actually performed the same function as the patients' own intact livers Such drastic measures are necessary because of the critical shortage of donated organs, according to Dr. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Reemtsma </PERSON>, chairman of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He performed the record-setting transplant in 1964 that involved the chimpanzee kidney. As of Tuesday, there were 14,993 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> waiting for kidney transplants, 1,252 for hearts, 767 for livers, 229 for heart-lungs, 257 for pancreases and 80 for lungs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even if we retrieved every -LRB- human -RRB- heart that is available, there still would be a shortage of donor organs,'' <PERSON> Reemtsma </PERSON> said. Research on cross-species transplants, called xenografts, is under way at about a dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions. Many of the animals have survived several months, and a few could have gone on indefinitely, <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON> said. Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, have found the potent anti-rejection drug cyclosporine, commonly used by human transplant patients, does not work well in cross-species transplants involving rodents. They report greater success with rabbit antibodies that target the cells attacking foreign tissue. Such experiments must move from rodents to primates before the procedure can be tested on people, perhaps during the next decade, <PERSON> Auchincloss </PERSON> said. Experts know they face tough decisions when that happens. `` Who do you do them on until the techniques are refined? Children or adults?'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> asked. `` Who goes first and how do you get informed consent? What do you say?''

<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> bounced back Wednesday, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged down against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 83.94-point loser the previous day, regained 189.86 points, or 0.56 percent, to end trading at 34,266.75 points. The dollar finished at 142.70 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.10 yen The currency moved between 142.43 yen and 142.90 yen. Traders said the dollar eased as market players sold it to buy <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies due to speculation that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> might raise its discount rate, following a similar move by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that it will raise its official discount rate by 0.75 percentage point to 3.25 percent effective Wednesday, reversing its easy money policy for the first time in nine years. `` The discount rate hike in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has little impact on foreign exchange dealings because it has been expected for over a month,'' said a trader with a major commercial bank. Speculative investors' demands for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency remained strong, he said. Analysts say President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge for a 20 percent cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> boosted the dollar because people expected the move would help reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit. On the stock exchange, dealers said the index's recovery was spurred by the yen's rebound on the currency exchange. But trading was directionless, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The energy of the market has been low due to uncertainties over the political situation and in the currency market, resulting in thin, directionless trading recently,'' he said. `` The strong yen has long been a merit in stock trading, but now its stability should be considered more than its level,'' the analyst added. Some participants remained on the sidelines due to concerns over a West German federal bank meeting Thursday, where market players speculate the West German interest rate might be raised again, he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter crashed upside down into the sea during night training exercises off <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, and 14 Marines were missing today and feared dead, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesmen said. Authorities said eight other Marines on board the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter, based in <LOCATION> Kaneohe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, were rescued shortly after the 11:55 p.m. crash Tuesday about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base. The names of the missing were withheld pending notification of next of kin, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The cause of the accident was under investigation. The Sea Knight helicopter had just taken off from the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said Marine Master Sgt. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> said the helicopter, built in 1967, was carrying a crew of four and 18 soldiers assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, for six months' training as part of a unit-rotation program. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said the helicopter `` pitched over to the right and went into the water inverted, upside down. I have nothing to indicate why it did that.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said the four injured men were being treated aboard the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, an amphibious transport vessel designed for amphibious assaults and capable of carrying up to six CH-46 helicopters. Capt. <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Kaneohe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the four suffered minor injuries. `` An investigation will be initiated immediately,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` As soon as they're able to talk, we'll start getting information immediately so we can start trying to piece together what happened in this tragedy.'' He said the pilot was not wearing night-vision goggles at the time of the accident. The helicopter went down 9 -LCB- miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kiyan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Nagatoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Naruse </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard He said three Japanese aircraft and six <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats joined two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels, including the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft in the search. Another coast guard spokesman, <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sameshima </PERSON>, said the weather in the area was fair at the time of the crash, with waves about three feet high. <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s southernmost prefecture, has the highest concentration of Marines outside of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the 20,000 Marines stationed there comprise about 10 percent of the corps. <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> was under American administration from 1945 until it was turned over to the Japanese in 1972. Under a mutual security pact, 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, including 35,000 on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. The concentration of American troops on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most densely populated prefectures, and the island's history as a bloody World War II battle site have made residents sensitive to training accidents Those sensitivities reached a boil this month when it was disclosed a hydrogen bomb fell off of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier in 1965 and remains lost at the bottom of the ocean only 80 miles from an inhabited Okinawan island. The latest tragedy came after fires aboard three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships killed 55 sailors earlier this spring. On April 19, an explosion and fire in a gun turret killed 47 sailors aboard the Norfolk-based battleship USS Iowa off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Six sailors died in an engine-room fire on the supply ship <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on May 9.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozieh </PERSON> woke from a nap and peered through the green shutter when the Jewish settlers began shooting. The shy 13-year-old had wanted to be a doctor, but she became a martyr instead. <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON> was the 500th Palestinian victim in nearly 18 months of rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. There was a single bullet hole in the shutter Tuesday. Members of her family said <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON>, ever inquisitive, looked out at the settlers shooting wildly in her farming village the day before and a bullet hit her in the chest. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media called it one of the worst vigilante attacks of the uprising, in which 22 Israelis also have been killed. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the raid was `` a shameful act.'' About two dozen Jewish settlers set a wheat field and part of a house ablaze in <LOCATION> Kifil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harith </LOCATION>, smashed windows in a car and a truck, and shot up several rooftop water tanks. Villagers said an elderly man was struck in the face with a gun and an 18-year-old was shot in the stomach. Police confirmed two people were wounded. Northern police commander <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Musafi </PERSON> said on army radio today that six suspects were detained and being questioned. He declined to elaborate. Two Israeli newspapers, Hadashot and Maariv, said the suspects were students at <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Tomb Yeshiva in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 12 miles away. The Haaretz daily said some lived in the <PERSON> Yizhar </PERSON> settlement next to <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and that more arrests were expected. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 20 of the seminary students were questioned about the case on Tuesday and that their rifles were taken for ballistic tests. Two students said on the radio they were hiking through the village to <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s tomb and fired their guns in response to a stoning attack. The Boziehs live about 50 yards from the white-domed monument at the biblical prophet's burial site. <PERSON> Gadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Zimra </PERSON>, one of the students, said: `` Our intention was to hike. There was no punishment mission here. Very close to the village, we were met with a barrage of stones and rocks. `` We were surrounded and, from that moment on, our lives were in real danger. Stones and rocks were flying from the houses. ... What we did, I mostly talk of myself, was to fire in the air only.'' Media reports suggested the assault on <PERSON> Kifil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harith </PERSON> was linked to a stoning attack Monday in which <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginzburg </PERSON>, the yeshiva's rabbi, was struck in the head during a hike with students to <LOCATION> Sinjil </LOCATION> village <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Malka </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> police commander, said on army radio that Jewish settlers set fires and began shooting before entering <PERSON> Kifil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harith </PERSON>. A senior military commander told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> the raid was of unprecedented severity and the settlers `` shot like madmen.'' It was the latest of several reprisal raids on Palestinian villages and neighborhoods after stoning attacks on settlers. Israeli civilians have killed 18 Palestinians since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kifil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harith </PERSON> said some raiders wore the skullcaps of religious Jews. `` There were about 30 of them who came through here with guns, throwing firebombs,'' he said. `` They burned our wheat and shouted things in Hebrew we could n't understand.'' Her village of 3,000 people has transformed <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozieh </PERSON> from a soft-spoken schoolgirl to a symbol of resistance to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags of green, black, red and white _ declared illegal by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ were unfurled Tuesday on the roof of the small stone house where she lived with her family. Children led by two men masked with red-checked Arab headdresses shouted: `` With blood and fire we will redeem Palestine!'' Inside, several dozen women in white veils sat in mourning on the floors. <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON>'s teacher, <PERSON> Subhia </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, showed a reporter the girl's workbooks from English class and said her favorite subjects were English and science. `` She was very clever, always at the top of her class,'' said the teacher, sitting in the living room not far from the green shutter with the single bullet hole. `` All she wanted to be was a doctor,'' said <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Samia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozieh </PERSON>, 46, who wore a white headscarf and a faded dress with a floral pattern. She said her daughter was awakened by the shots and went to the window. `` Next thing, she stumbled into the corridor and said ` Mommy, I have been shot here,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Bozieh </PERSON> said, holding both hands over her heart. `` Then she fell dead.'' The Boziehs have 11 other children. One of them, <PERSON> Ibtisam </PERSON>'s 18-year-old sister, <PERSON> Hanan </PERSON>, said, `` It is good to die for your country.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate charged with four murders was a brilliant student and a star athlete, but was frustrated entering the working world by a lingering, poorly understood illness, neighbors and friends said. A judge on Tuesday set a $ 4 million bail for <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>, who was formally charged with four counts of first-degree murder for a Memorial Day rampage that left his mother, brother, a family friend and a neighbor dead. `` What would make a young boy, a promising kid, just snap like this?'' asked Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> <PERSON> Span </PERSON>. `` We do n't know. That fatal moment he just lost all control. This was not a malicious boy.'' <PERSON> Span </PERSON> did not order a psychiatric evaluation. <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>, who was being held in the <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, was carried, manacled and dressed in jail khakis, into the court. Police said they found no indication of drug or alcohol use in a search of <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>'s house. They recovered what they said was the murder weapon, a 10-inch butcher knife. As a straight-A student at <ORGANIZATION> Oratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he graduated in 1983, <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> was named Union County Scholar-Athlete of the Year, served as editor of the school newspaper, was captain of the Chess Team and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was everything you wanted to see in a young man,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotunno </PERSON>, Oratory's headmaster. `` He was academically gifted, but he was really well-rounded in everything. I never even saw him angry.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Galluzzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who live in the tree-lined, upper-middle class <LOCATION> Springbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> neighborhood with <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> told them six months ago that her 23-year-old son was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which also has been called Epstein-Barr Syndrome. The syndrome has the nickname `` yuppie flu'' because it tends to strike high-achieving, hard-driving people in their 30s. But Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatigue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, called the label `` purely a media misnomer.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> has cited the syndrome as a new illness that can also occur in the poor and elderly. `` I have difficulty connecting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as it is now defined, to homicide,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. But he said the syndrome can cause depression. `` Suicide is certainly common,'' he said. The symptoms include long-term fatigue, possibly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes a form of mononucleosis. Some medical researchers are looking into mental illness as a cause for the syndrome. `` His mother talked about this syndrome thing because people were asking about <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON>, when was he going back to work and all that,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` It did n't seem like anything was wrong with him, he was just a normal kid, and a brain. He just went ape, that's all.'' The other victims were <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>'s 20-year-old brother, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>; family friend <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Paiva </PERSON>, 20; and neighbor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 36. Neighbor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> was in stable condition Tuesday with stab wounds to the chest. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> worked a short time as an intern with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before mononucleosis forced him to drop out in February 1988, neighbors said.

 The nation's first lawsuit filed under a new federal law that bars housing discrimination against families with children has been settled out-of-court for $ 25,000. A federal court on Tuesday approved the settlement between the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LaFonge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an apartment management company.

The amendments passed last year prohibit housing discrimination against people with handicaps and those with children. Retirement communities with special facilities for elderly people are exempt. LaFonge officials denied any wrongdoing. `` The owners do not want prolonged litigation to obscure their long-standing commitment to providing decent housing for all persons,'' the company said. `` Rather than devote substantial resources to litigation ... involving a single isolated incident, it is far more appropriate to resolve this issue in a way which truly serves the goal of fair housing.'' The $ 25,000 award will go to the Housing Coalition of <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which brought the complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the woman.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Pronounce Uprising Leader's Execution Illegal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist leaders have agreed that <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, leader of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, was illegally executed two years later after being convicted of counterrevolution, a party spokesman said. After Tuesday's announcement, however, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said that while he did not oppose <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s legal rehabilitation he was opposed to blaming the party for the premier's execution. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> had called for open, multiparty elections before the short-lived revolt was crushed by Soviet tanks. Reformers within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have backed calls for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s rehabilitation as the country moves toward a multiparty political system. Also during its meeting Monday, the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided to move up to the fall a party congress that had been scheduled for 1990. The committee agreed that `` there is every indication'' that <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> `` was executed in the wake of a show trial and that his sentence was a violation of the law,'' party spokesman <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> told reporters. In a later television interview, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> claimed no part of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had taken a position on <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s guilt or innocence. `` Those returning the verdict were obviously influenced by other forces'' he did not identify. `` The sentence was not a -LRB- party -RRB- decision.'' Major said there had been `` considerable debate'' during Monday's session on <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed it can not come to a final decision, because documents are still missing and a judicial review is still in progress. Major told reporters, `` Several <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members pointed out that <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> died a committed communist.'' The party's admission came as no surprise in the wake of a public debate over <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s 1958 execution and burial in an unmarked grave. On June 16, the remains of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and some of his associates are to be reburied. Major said the party would like the day to be one of national reconciliation but said it plan to be represented at the reburial since it was not invited. The event is to be televised to the nation. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domonkos </PERSON>, a deputy department head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that the date of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first multiparty elections _ promised by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> authorities _ depends on talks with opposition groups,. The talks have been delayed by disagreements over the makeup of negotiating teams and the agenda. Also Tuesday, two Central Committee members stepped down, the party said in a communique. The two _ <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajnai </PERSON>, the current ambassador to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, were both involved in the <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> case as <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials, say relatives of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and other victims of the post-revolt crackdown.

 Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> was remembered in the state he represented in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for half a century as a tireless advocate for the elderly and poor, a powerful orator and a charming, humble man. `` He was a particularly talented and able man who did n't have any selfishness in him,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 78, a Democrat and now dean of the state's congressional delegation. `` He was just interested in what he could do for mankind.'' The body of the 88-year-old congressman, who died Tuesday, will lie in state in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol Rotunda on Thursday, a measure of respect typically reserved for national heroes. He will be buried in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> next to his wife, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, who died of cancer in 1979. Tributes came from admirers and political foes from all over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which Pepper watched grow from mostly rural land into the nation's fourth most-populous state, and home to many of the senior citizens whose cause he championed. `` The sense of loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory of a lifetime full of achievements on behalf of all people,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` He always said it was the senior citizens who made this country great,'' said <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a 74-year-old resident of Mildred and <ORGANIZATION> Claude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION>, a federally subsidized senior-citizen apartment complex in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where the flag flew at half staff. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> remembered Pepper telling her that after working to raise and educate their children, senior citizens are still contributing to society. `` In my life, he made me think that maybe I did make a contribution,'' she said. Pepper served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from 1936 to 1950, when he lost a re-election bid after being branded `` Red Pepper'' and charged with being soft on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He taught and practiced law until winning election to the House in 1962. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> praised his fellow <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat as `` a champion for justice _ for civil rights, for a prepared <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to defeat Nazi tyranny and for dignity for older Americans. `` America will miss this champion but we will honor his memory by renewing our dedication to his ideals of justice and human dignity.'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> recalled that Pepper once served with his maternal grandfather, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, who represented <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for 42 years. He said Pepper would be missed `` by Americans everywhere whose lives are now better because of his dedication and leadership.'' `` Senator Pepper was as old as this century, yet he was perhaps the first of our modern leaders for the new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>. `` When you consider he was a man who knew <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and welcomed the astronauts back from the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, you have an understanding of the span of history he represented,'' said Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Pepper's friend for 30 years. Despite his age, Pepper never lost his oratorial skills that made him famous on the House floor. `` He could spellbind an audience,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, vice president of development for <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, which has the Mildred and <ORGANIZATION> Claude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and custody of the congressman's papers. `` He could walk into a room filled with people and the whole room would light up.'' <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sermon </PERSON>, a Pepper Towers resident, said she had known Pepper since 1932 and would n't be living in the housing complex if it were n't for him. `` He was strictly for the senior citizens _ the rock of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sermon </PERSON> said. `` If he promised you anything, you got it. He was here for us.'' Pepper represented the 18th Congressional District, which covers most of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION> and Key Biscayne. Its center is <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s heavily Cuban Eighth Street, or <PERSON> Calle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocho </PERSON>, and 50 percent of the district is Hispanic. A special election will be held to fill the seat.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Against Yen, Stocks Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar lost ground today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as stock prices rose sharply. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which fell 83.94 points Tuesday, gained 189.86 points or 0.56 percent to end trading at 34,266.75, a record high. The dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.10 yen The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency opened lower at 142.50 yen and ranged from 142.43 to 142.90 yen during the day. Traders attributed the dollar's slip to a similar down-swing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Tuesday. `` Trading was inactive, with market players only making position adjustments at around 142.70 yen because of the absence of market-affecting news,'' said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The expected meeting of the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> later today and release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for May on Friday made some investors stay on the sidelines, he said. Market players and news reports speculated that West German monetary authorities may decide at the meeting to raise the central bank's discount rate. The trader said the rise in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s official discount rate had no major impact on the market. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> raised its key rate today by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25 percent. On the stock market, high-tech issues attracted participants and contributed to the sharp rise in the Nikkei index, said <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Market players also were reassured by the apparent stabilization of the yen-dollar exchange rate,'' he said. `` People tend to pay too much attention to the rate itself but the market has come to consider it satisfactory as long as the rate is stable,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> said. Trading was active, with volume on the market's first section estimated at 1 billion shares. Technology issues including <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> attracted buyers, as did automobile issues.

 As about 100 looters _ men, women and children _ descended on <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidalle </PERSON>'s store, the five policemen assigned to guard it were helpless. Very soon, it was empty of meat, vegetables and fruit, wine and cheese. The raiders Tuesday even took the cleaning prducts. `` This ruins me,'' <PERSON> Bidalle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Senes </PERSON>, who owns a neighborhood grocery, said he would help guard his store. `` I do n't have any alternative,'' <PERSON> Senes </PERSON> said as he and other grocery store and butcher shop owners tried to protect themselves from looting that began a week ago because of raging inflation and economic chaos in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. A heavy metal shutter protecting the front of one store carried a warning: `` Danger. Door Electrified.'' Despite a state of siege declared Monday by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, sporadic looting continued Tuesday in <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>, a meat-packing city of 1 million people about 185 miles north of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe provincial police reinforced by members of the paramilitary border force guarded shops and patrolled streets. Little public transport was running and schools, closed Monday, did not reopen. Police reported at least six people killed, 70 injured and about 1,000 arrested. Many supermarkets were stripped Monday, particularly those near slum districts. Most of the looters were women, children and teen-agers. The manager of one supermarket said some people `` fought for a piece of meat or a bag of mate,'' the herbal tea that is a staple in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` They looked like hungry poor people, but there also were thieves who took advantage of the situation,'' he said. One woman in her 70s, rushing out of a food market with a bag of groceries, shouted: `` Thank God, today I can eat!'' Crowds gathered around many neighborhood stores Tuesday, but guards generally were able to hold them back with shields and truncheons. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said his small market four miles from downtown <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> was raided three times Monday. Fifty border guards surrounded it Tuesday morning. If the looting continues, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said, `` I have two alternatives: I can put the little I have left in the street and give it away or I can just set fire to it all.'' He said he opened the store two years ago `` with four cans of preserves.'' `` I was successful, but now what do I do?'' he said. About 100 people, most of them poorly dressed women and children, milled around in the street beyond the ring of guards. Cmdr. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, in charge of the guards, said he had orders to hold off looters with tear gas or rubber bullets, `` but we are afraid to shoot because many women have children in their arms.''

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Wants to Aid Non-Communist Guerrillas In Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support a covert supply of weapons to non-communist guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam-backed government, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The aid would be used to strengthen Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s position in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government and with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> forces The newspaper attributed the report to unidentified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. Earlier this month, the prince indicated he might be able to reach an accommodation with the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government under certain conditions. The Times quoted a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official as saying, `` We believe that appropriate assistance will strengthen the political standing and security of the non-Communist resistance and enhance its position'' in negotiations for a political settlement of the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The official said such aid would help the non-communist force hold its own if the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> tried to seize control. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said he had not been notified of any new administration initiative on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` Their policy always was that they wanted to give lethal aid to the Sihanouk'' forces, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman said in a telephone interview Tuesday night with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said such aid was included in an administration bill, but he was not sure of its status and added that the administration has not pushed for the aid. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> was among three senators who wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last weekend opposing lethal aid to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s forces on grounds it may fall into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` My view is that would be a major error unless there is specific language that it not go to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said when asked what his reaction would be to such a proposal from the administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, ruled the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country from 1975 through 1978, and presided over the period in which 1 million Cambodians died. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who refused to be identified would not be specific when asked whether the administration would seek congressional backing for lethal aid to the non-Communist forces. `` It's our policy to do what we can do to strengthen the non-communist resistance,'' the official told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that by doing so they will be better able to play the essential political role which will be required if there is to be a comprehensive political settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. And such a settlement is the best way of controlling the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Black Child Should Remain With White Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ruled that a 5-year-old black child should remain with his white foster parents, ending a three-year custody fight with the boy's black former guardians. The Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who had custody of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullard </PERSON> between 1985 and 1988, said he and his wife, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, will not appeal Tuesday's decision by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our family has suffered greatly,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to keep dragging it on and on and on. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he has declined to see the child during the appeal for fear of confusing him and would continue that to help the youngster adjust to the home of <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. The boy turns 6 on June 25. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, said his clients are hopeful `` that a long nightmare is over.'' `` I'm very happy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. `` Hopefully it's over. When he was a few months old in October 1983, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> was placed with the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> for what was supposed to be six months. But his mother, who had emotional problems, was deemed not ready to resume caring for the child at the end of the period, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> remained with the <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> family. At age 2, he was moved to the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' home under a city policy that tries to match children with culturally similar foster parents. The <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> challenged the policy. In August, a federal court ordered the child returned to their custody, ruling the Constitution prevented agencies from using race as the sole reason to remove a child from a foster home. The <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> appealed the case. A three-judge panel ruled Tuesday that while the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> have been `` superb foster parents,'' a return to the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> offered <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> `` the best hope of realizing his full potential.'' A report from Dr. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazelon </PERSON>, a psychiatrist chosen by the city to examine <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> while he lived with each family, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> had suffered depression and developmental problems after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> said the decision set an important precedent. `` This confirms that the city was wrong to remove the child on the basis of race _ that what's most important is the child's needs,'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> said `` We believe that it's the right decision and should have nationwide impact.''

 Tiananmen Square, a raucous rallying point for students demanding democratic rights by day, at night becomes a carnival ground of concerts, dancing and exotic food. While thousands of students camped out on the square doze in rickety huts, night owls sing folk songs and dance to tinny sounds from portable cassette players. Some sing Chinese ballads or hearty renditions of <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON>. Others croon <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, sometimes in English, sometimes in Chinese. One night last week students held a talent show, including serenaders and an amateur stand-up comic. Another night there was a huge rock concert, with 10,000 fans clustered around the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes as popular Chinese singers took turns at the mike. `` I've been coming out here since the protests began,'' said guitar strummer <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>, a 22-year-old student at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. `` The students on the square are exhausted, so I try to provide some atmosphere for them.'' <PERSON> Cai </PERSON>, clad only in a loose green shirt and smudged red shorts, sings folk songs from the provinces, such as the tragicomic tale of a man with a bad leg: `` For the revolution, for the party `` The cripple joined the army, `` For the revolution, for the party `` The cripple died for the army.'' Traditional and romantic numbers are in. Jabs at unpopular leaders are not. Unlike the strident chants of millions of protesters in the last two weeks taunting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and questioning the mental competence of aging senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the balladeers do n't poke fun at their enemies. `` We're not here to insult anybody, we're seeking political reforms,'' said a student from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who gave her name only as <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>. She was singing with about 20 other colleagues outside a clumsily built tent at 4:00 a.m.. A few couples stroll arm-in-arm under a crescent moon in the vast expanse sweeping southward from the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emperors once lived, though <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> has hardly become a lover's lane Some slow dance at the mini-dances that spring up spontaneously, swaying to drippy instrumental tunes from cassette players set on the ground. With sundown, the avenues bordering the square fill with vendors of barbecued mutton, onion pancakes, dumpling soup and noodles stretched from dough as you watch. But most of the food goes to curious residents of the capital who come to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> at night for a moonlit glimpse at the revolution, which began May 13 with a hunger strike by some 3,000 students and swelled to more than 200,000 before tapering off. The students, many from outlying provinces and most of them broke, rely on donations for their meals, usually a couple of buns twice a day, sometimes with rice porridge and a bottle of chalky soda pop. `` Look how cracked my lips are,'' said a rower from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I collapsed once during the hunger strike. What's hardest is keeping up our strength.'' It's easier to stay up all night because of the cold, the rower said. `` If I sleep at night I get the chills,'' he said, squatting on a thick cotton jacket on Tiananmen's concrete pavement. Overnight temperatures drop to 52 degrees. The food situation has improved lately, said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shounan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Anhui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>: `` The last couple of days we each got an egg with our meals.'' The lamps glowing in the square go out around 5:15 a.m. and the nights wind down with the raising of the national flag by a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> honor guard at sunrise. `` You see, we are a patriotic movement, nothing more,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> coed who stayed up to join about 100 others and applaud the flag-raising. `` I may lose sleep, but it's worth it.

 Hundreds of people cheered at calls for swift, sure and lengthy imprisonment for sex offenders at a meeting prompted by the rape and mutilation of a young boy. `` The case that has drawn us here tonight is everybody's worst nightmare ... the sadistic abuse of a child,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday night. More than 400 people filled the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Light </LOCATION> auditorium for the meeting, which was punctuated by cheers, applause and calls from the crowd for the death penalty. At least another 50 people watched on closed-circuit television from down the hall and dozens were unable to get inside. The meeting was organized by sexual assault counselors and community leaders to deal with the uproar after a 7-year-old boy was raped and his penis cut off on May 20. More than $ 100,000 has been raised or pledged from around the country for the youngster, who is recovering. Charges of attempted murder, rape and assault have been filed against <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON>, 39, diagnosed as retarded and confined in prison and mental health institutions five times since 1965. A legislative hearing on the case is scheduled Friday in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. `` I am angry. I'm appalled. I'm frustrated,'' said <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stortini </PERSON>. `` We must eliminate the gap between the mental health system and the criminal justice system.'' County Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladenburg </PERSON> drew one of the biggest cheers when he called for building a mental health prison. He dismissed the notion that treatment could cure habitual child sex abusers as `` a'60s mentality ... that's not the reality.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Comte </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Comte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which provides therapy for sex offenders, said the 200 people being treated in his program `` probably represent 2,000 to 3,000 victims.'' But <PERSON> Comte </PERSON> warned that incarcerating every sex offender indefinitely would mean 10 or 15 new prisons. There was an uncomfortable stirring when <PERSON> Comte </PERSON> said he recognized men in the audience who had been through treatment successfully `` and are now law-abiding, taxpaying citizens.'' Loud applause also followed calls for more widespread and explicit warnings about sex offenders, including publicizing their names once they have completed prison terms. Also popular were calls for laws to ensure that more sex offenders are locked up and fewer are released. Most audience members were orderly during the two-hour session, but a few interrupted speakers with shouts like `` Castrate him!'' from one man and `` What about the death penalty for the untreatable?'' from one woman. Others complained bitterly of being unable to get charges filed against ex-husbands they claimed had abused their children, and some said they now were afraid to let their children play outside. `` Do I tell my hyperactive child, after they told me to let her run around outdoors as much as possible, she has to stay in the house and drive all of us crazy?'' one woman shouted. No one who spoke from the audience gave his or her name. State Rep. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tacoma </LOCATION>, got a vocal response when he urged voter approval of a state constitutional amendment to bolster victims' rights, including a right to be heard at sentencing. `` Why wait till November?'' one man shouted. The Legislature has already passed the amendment. State Attorney General <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> was among the crowd unable to get in the building. He said he was ready to help draft legislation to keep dangerous sex offenders and those likely to commit sex offenses locked up. Petitions circulated inside and outside the building calling for a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> for tougher laws against sexual crimes that cause severe bodily harm or death.

 Prosecutors have dropped charges in a 1987 child kidnapping case that had yielded a conviction of the wrong man and a mistrial for a second suspect. Box Elder County Attorney <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunderson </PERSON> on Tuesday filed a motion to dismiss charges of child kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse of a child and aggravated kidnapping against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Headley </PERSON>, 32. <PERSON> Bunderson </PERSON> said he had consulted with the parents of the victim, a 9-year-old girl who was abducted from a schoolyard on March 24, 1987, sexually abused and abandoned the next day across the border in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` I think this was a mutual decision we all reached,'' <PERSON> Bunderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Elma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was convicted in August 1987 but released from prison four months later after authorities said they had evidence implicating <PERSON> Headley </PERSON>. A mistrial was declared in <PERSON> Headley </PERSON>'s trial May 19 after the eight-member jury became deadlocked and said it could not reach a decision because of a `` lack of facts.'' <PERSON> Bunderson </PERSON> said those difficulties were weighed in his decision to file the motion. `` I do n't see that another jury would do anything differently, to tell the truth,'' he said. Prosecutors also did not want to subject the girl to a third appearance on the witness stand. The girl, who was 6 at the time of her abduction, had not identified <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> as her assailant but was able to pick <PERSON> Headley </PERSON>, of Snowville, out of a photo collage and a police lineup. The case was further complicated when it was learned both suspects drove blue cars, smoked cigarettes with brown tips, and owned the same breed of dog.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading dissident was indicted today on charges his controversial and unauthorized trip to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> violated his country's national security law. Prosecutors said the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, 71, and a traveling companion, <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ho </PERSON>, 59, were charged with ignoring the country's ban on unauthorized travel to a hostile government and praising `` anti-state elements'' during a nine-day trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> The two were arrested April 13 on their return to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and have been held in detention since. If convicted, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> could be sentenced to anywhere from five years in prison to death, although there is little chance he would be executed. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trip triggered a major controversy, with South Korean officials saying the dissident clergyman's visit to the communist capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> aided North Korean attempts to cause unrest and discredit the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. While in the north, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> to discuss territorial reunification and other issues. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> holds that talks with the north should be conducted through official channels only and that <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> did not represent the south. The charges accuse <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> of asking <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-mo </PERSON>, a Korean resident in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to arrange the trip. <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> is charged with receiving money from leaders of <LOCATION> Hanmintong </LOCATION>, a pro-North Korean organization in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to buy a parliamentary nomination from an opposition party last year. <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> was also charged with receiving $ 120,000 dollars from <LOCATION> Hanmintong </LOCATION> to set up an engineering company and act as agent for the group in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hee </PERSON>, an editorial advisor to the liberal newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hankyoreh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinmum </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted last week for attempting to arrange an unauthorized trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for reporters on the newspaper. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the peninsula into the communist north and capitalist south at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950, touching off the bloody three-year Korean War.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A threat from entertainer <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and two anonymous telephone calls prompted `` Cotton Club'' producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> to hire a bodyguard about six months before he was killed, <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s former assistant testified. At a preliminary hearing for three defendants Tuesday, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> sought protection after <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> threatened to `` call out the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mafia </LOCATION> on him.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> has not been named in the case. A telephone call to a number listed as his residence yielded no answer Tuesday evening. Attorneys for the defendants were trying to show that many other people had motives to kill <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, an obese, cocaine-sniffing producer whose first attempt at Hollywood movie-making was aborted by his slaying. The prosecution contends that reputed drug dealer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> arranged <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s murder after they fought about her share of profits from the movie, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> is charged along with <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, former bodyguards for Hustler magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is fighting extradition in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The current hearing will determine whether Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> stand trial. Six months before his disappearance, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> hired a former wrestler named <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> to guard him. He was asked to explain. `` We had a very bad experience in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. Asked to explain, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> replied, `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> made threats to him and threatened to call out the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mafia </LOCATION> on him ... This took place in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' He indicated <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was part of a show <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> had staged at <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s casino in the gambling resort. `` Were you present when the threats were made?'' asked attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. `` I was present in the office at <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s when <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> pointed a finger at <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and said, ` I'll see that you're straightened out because you're in my territory now,''' <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> said He did not explain what triggered the remarks, and further questioning was cut off by Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who ruled it was irrelevant. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said that in the months leading up to <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s May 1983, disappearance, at least two anonymous phone callers threatened <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s life. He quoted one of the callers as saying, `` <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> has been shooting off his mouth too much. He should take the deal the way it is and shut his mouth.'' The second caller, he said, warned that if <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> did n't heed warnings, `` he'll find himself dead.'' <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s show business connections have added glitter to the case. Actor <PERSON> Demond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of TV's `` Sanford and Son'' was scheduled to take the stand sometime today. Former <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who initially was implicated in the case, invoked Fifth Amendment protection against self incrimination and refused to testify. He and <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> collaborated on raising money for `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' production after they were introduced by Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> disappeared after leaving for dinner with Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> on May 13, 1983. His body was found a month later in a dry riverbed 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He had been shot repeatedly in the head. The defense stepped up its attack on the dead man's character Tuesday, eliciting testimony that he physically abused his former wife, used cocaine in excessive amounts and substituted the tranquilizer Thorazine when he was withdrawing from cocaine.

 First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dedicated a cross-cut slab from a 750-year-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redwood tree today as a symbol of lasting friendship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that the piece of redwood had lived long and traveled far to reach its new resting spot on a windswept knoll in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s Rheinaue Park. `` I hope passersby will enjoy this redwood slab and I also hope they will be reminded of the close ties and friendship between our peoples,'' she told about 200 West German well wishers who gathered at the park for a brief dedication ceremony. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, dressed in a royal blue and white silk dress with matching jacket, said the redwood monument had been fashioned from a tree felled in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Six Rivers National Forest. It was transported by ship from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, then by train to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s capital. The 8-foot-wide slab was mounted on its side atop an oak platform to display its rings. Small brass plaques embedded in the wood note important dates in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s history. The redwood gift is intended to mark <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s 2,000 th anniversary, which is being celebrated this year in tandem with the 40th anniversary of the founding of the West German state A White House statement said the giant redwood from which the slab was cut had been `` harvested for environmentally sound reasons.'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> thanked Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the redwood gift and `` for the great help of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people with the rebuilding of the <LOCATION> Federal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after the war.'' <PERSON> Hannelore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, wife of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, said the redwood display would remind visitors of `` the continuity of the world.'' To applause from the mostly elderly crowd, Mrs. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement that West Germans no longer would need visas to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After the two first ladies posed for pictures with <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> in front of the redwood display, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved briskly through the crowd shaking hands.

<HEAD>Domestic Partners Law Goes To Mayor After Second OK By Supervisors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A law allowing unmarried couples, including homosexuals, to register their unions and receive a document like a marriage license was sent for signing to Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>. The mayor has pledged to sign the legislation, which won its second passage Tuesday by the city Board of Supervisors. `` This will let people love as they will,'' said Board President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who sponsored the measure. The supervisors voted 9-0, with two absent, to support the `` domestic partners'' law allowing unmarried couples to register their relationships publicly for a $ 35 fee. The supervisors also voted unanimously for the second time to form a task force to examine the possibility of extending city health benefits to the live-in lovers of city employees. The board passed both measures unanimously last week. Some religious leaders, including Roman Catholic Archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, have called the legislation an attack on the family. A few other cities have extended health benefits to live-in lovers of municipal employees. But <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would be the first to allow any unmarried couples to register their relationships the way traditional couples obtain marriage licenses.

 A father distraught over his 5-year-old son's suffering from leukemia took the child from a hospital where he was undergoing court-ordered treatment, police said today <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON>, 36, took his son, <PERSON> Darian </PERSON>, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital sometime Sunday. `` We have no reason to believe the child is in any danger from his father,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who added that the father's action violated a court order Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said the father `` had indicated that he did n't want the boy to suffer and that he wanted him to enjoy life.'' Pagan's brother-in-law told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Darian </PERSON> had been complaining of pain and that his father wanted to take the boy to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

The mother, <PERSON> Migdalia </PERSON>, 35, noticed <PERSON> Darian </PERSON> was missing from the hospital Sunday evening and alerted staff. Police said the father had been with his son at the hospital all day.

 A song publishing firm has sued the widow of rock' n' roll star <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> for $ 1 million over royalty rights from at least 15 songs he recorded late in life. <ORGANIZATION> Acuff-Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> claims <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> induced her husband to breach a $ 70,000-a-year songwriting contract allegedly signed in July 1985.

Mrs. <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> did not immediately respond to a request for comment relayed Tuesday through <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON>'s Los Angeles-based publicist.

<HEAD>Zoo Atlanta's Lowland Gorilla Willie B. Meets Girls for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Everything was set for the first date: a nicely decorated room, a convenient hammock, various playthings. And some water hoses and tranquilizer darts, just so things would n't get out of hand. After all, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> had n't been with a female for 28 years, and it was n't clear how the silverback lowland gorilla would react. `` I hope the gorilla's not as nervous as I am,'' Atlanta Zoo Director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said before Tuesday's meeting. The 30-year-old male gorilla was introduced to a pair of female gorillas in a specially designed room. He had been isolated from others of his kind for 28 years, allowed to observe other gorillas only from a distance and through heavy mesh. But neither Willie B. nor the two females _ 6-year-old <LOCATION> Kinyani </LOCATION> and 26-year-old <LOCATION> Katoomba </LOCATION> _ showed any shyness. Both females are from the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kinyani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katoomba </PERSON> were free to decide whether to join <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> by using an overhead door large enough for them but too small for Willie B. They waltzed right in, Maple said. Two other doors just big enough for <LOCATION> Kinyani </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Katoomba </LOCATION> to escape were available. Both used the doors several times but always returned to the room, <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> made a few rushes, <PERSON> Katoomba </PERSON> responded with charges of her own, and soon <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> gave way, letting the female chase him around the room. `` This may be her social experience showing through,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, chief of reproductive biology at <LOCATION> Yerkes </LOCATION>. `` She's been through introductions before and has a history of being able to look after herself. A staring match followed, but after it broke up the gorillas sat in relative quiet. `` It could n't be going any better,'' Maple said. `` So far, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> has proved to be very normal in the behaviors he has shown during the socialization process.'' <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the zoo, said the norm among gorillas is for each male to `` hang out'' with a group of females; male gorillas tend to be antagonistic toward one another and could fight. `` This is just a period of socialization for <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>,'' she said. Dates will continue each day in the 37 - by 20-foot room, <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said Zoo officials hope the gorillas will mold themselves into a family, with <PERSON> Katoomba </PERSON> eventually bearing <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s child. Next week, officials plan to let the gorillas continue their courtship outdoors. There are three other gorilla troops in the $ 4.5 million Ford African Rain Forest habitat. The troops are separated by moats. `` If all goes well with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>.'s introduction, we will be the only zoo to have four gorilla troops on exhibit every day,'' Maple said.

 Dead animals are piling up in refrigerated trailers on the coast as officials collect evidence of the vast damage caused by the oil spilled from the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. The carcasses of 22,818 migratory birds, 733 sea otters and 51 birds of prey, most of them bald eagles, had been collected, tagged and stored by Tuesday at four coastal cities. `` It's a morbid milestone we have reached this week; more than two months after the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez, we are still counting its victims,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> regional director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The gooey fingers of the spill have drifted more than 500 miles from Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> across the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and beyond <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. About 11 million gallons of oil spilled from gashes in the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24. More than 70 species of birds have been affected, the wildlife service said. About 60 percent of the dead birds are murres, an upright seabird with tuxedo-like markings. The carcasses in cold storage may represent only a small percentage of the total number of animals killed by the spill, officials have said. `` They are saying these numbers are about 5 percent of the actual number impacted from this,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidrick </PERSON>, a Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employee in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` The carcasses are being saved for evidence ... for the courts.'' Surveys are underway, but the federal government has not yet made an official estimate of the wildlife deaths.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech on <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations as delivered Wednesday Thank you, Chancellor -LRB- Helmut -RRB- <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. At the outset, let me tell you that lest you think that he has forgotten his home state because he is the chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, I will only tell you that in the last 24 hours, Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has been convincing me that when I came to this state and to <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, I would be coming to heaven. And having gotten here, I think he may just about be right, I'll tell you. Thank you all very much. Dr. -LRB- <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> -LRB- governor of the <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> State -RRB-, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>, distinguished hosts, I want to also thank these two bands, West German and American, for that stirring music. And Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, I especially want to thank you again for inviting me to this beautiful and ancient city on my first presidential trip to the Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the Federal Republic. And <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and I have concluded now our deliberations at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> _ an excellent start to our working partnership as chancellor and president. And here in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, by the banks of the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>, it's often said that this heartland of mountain vineyards and villages embodies the very soul of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. So <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> provides a fitting forum for an American president to address the German people. Today, I come to speak not just of our mutual defense but of our shared values. I come to speak not just of our, the matters of the mind, but of the deeper aspirations of the heart. Just this morning, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I were charmed with the experiences we had. I met with a group, small group of German students, bright young men and women who studied in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Their knowledge of our country and the world was impressive, to say the least. But sadly, too many in the West, Americans and Europeans alike, seem to have forgotten the lessons of our common heritage and how the world we know came to be. And that should not be and that can not be. We must recall that the generation coming into its own in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is heir to gifts greater than those bestowed to any generation in history _ peace, freedom and prosperity.

<TEXT>
 This inheritance is possible because 40 years ago the nations of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> joined in that noble common cause called <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. First there was the vision, the concept of free peoples in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, working to protect their values. And second, there was the practical sharing of risks and burdens in a realistic recognition of Soviet expansionism. And finally, there was the determination to look beyond old animosities. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance did nothing less than provide a way for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to heal centuries-old rivalries, to begin an era of reconciliation and restoration. It has been, in fact, a second renaissance of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. As you know best, this is not just the 40th birthday of the alliance. It's also the 40th birthday of the Federal Republic _ a republic born in hope, tempered by challenge. At the height of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> crisis in 1948, <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> called on Germans to stand firm and confident. And you did _ courageously, magnificently. The historic genius of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people has flourished in this age of peace, and your nation has become a leader in technology, the fourth-largest economy on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But more important, you've inspired the world by forcefully promoting the principles of human rights, democracy and freedom The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> have always been firm friends and allies, but today we share an added role: partnersd in leadership. Of course, leadership has a constant companion _ responsibility. And our responsibility is to look ahead and grasp the promise of the future. I said recently that we're at the end of one era and at the beginning of another. And I noted that in regard to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, our policy is to move beyond containment. For 40 years, the seeds of democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> lay dormant, buried under the frozen tundra of the Cold War. And for 40 years, the world has waited for the Cold War to end. And decade after decade, time after time, the flowering human spirit withered from the chill of conflict and oppression. And again, the world waited. But the passion for freedom can not be denied forever. The world has waited long enough. The time is right. Let <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be whole and free. To the founders of the Alliance, this aspiration was a distant dream. And now it's the new mission of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. If ancient rivals like <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can reconcile, then why not the nations of the East and West? In the East, brave men and women are showing us the way. Look at <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where Solidarity ... and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have won legal status. The forces of freedom are putting the Soviet status quo on the defensive. In the West, we have succeeded because we've been faithful to our values and our vision. And on the other side of the rusting Iron Curtain, their vision failed. The Cold War began with the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It can only end when <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is whole. And today, it is this very concept of a divided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is under siege. And that's why our hopes run especially high, because the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is under siege, not by armies, but by the spread of ideas that began here, right here. It was a son of <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutenberg </PERSON>, who liberated the mind of man through the power of the printed word. And that same liberating power is unleashed today in a hundred new forms.

 This looks like any former company town in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, with parallel rows of virtually identical houses, a small, soapsud-filled creek flowing past back yards and a played-out mine. But residents are worried about something unseen that sets <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION> apart _ it may be contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals. For years, <ORGANIZATION> Shafer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> removed oil from old electrical transformers they were rebuilding, burning some oil for heat, giving some to residents to use in furnaces and dumping the rest in a pit at the mouth of the former <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION> mine, residents say. The oil is laced with polychlorinated biphenyls, known to cause cancer in laboratory animals. PCBs bond to soil and are not water-soluble, so any contaminated oil dumped 15 years ago could still present a health risk. Frequent floods along <LOCATION> Arbuckle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which flows through town, have dumped tons of mud from the plant into yards and basements. <PERSON> Oak </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a city of 9,200 a few miles to the west, also gets much of its water from the area. `` When you sit and think that we've been exposed to this contamination for 15 years,'' said resident <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Workman </PERSON>, `` I'm of the opinion there is no way they could ever clean it up.'' The federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 3 million cleaning up the plant, hauling away 4,735 tons of contaminated dirt, 110 drums of contaminated liquids and solids, 23 drums of electric capacitors and 21 transformers, said agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Last month, the agency agreed to test the soil within three miles of the site. But some residents, who have formed a group called Concerned Citizens to <LOCATION> Save </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, think no amount of work will make the town safe. They want a state or federal buyout of their town and creation of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION> somewhere else _ at an estimated cost at $ 20 million. `` Money _ should that be a consideration when people's lives are at stake?'' asked <PERSON> Workman </PERSON>, 30, the mother of two. Simply moving is out of the question for most of the town's 300 families because no one wants to buy a house here, she said. `` You ca n't give a piece of property away,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> soil study will begin in September and take at least six months, said <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddy </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. If high levels of PCBs are found, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> will investigate whether they have caused any health problems. A state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study of the town's mortality figures from 1979 to 1985 found nothing unusual. But a study by <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students last year came up with vastly different results. The students found traces of PCBs in soil taken from 17 of 19 sites. They also surveyed 173 residents and found 62 percent of the women surveyed had suffered miscarriages or stillbirths, or had children with birth defects. Sixteen percent said they had cancer, 18 percent suffered from liver disorders, 34 percent had skin problems ranging from dryness to hair loss, and 31 percent reported a persistent cough _ all apparent symptoms of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> contact. `` We do n't know anything about the protocol for the study, the methods they used, anything about the study,'' <PERSON> Haddy </PERSON> said, but added, `` We're interested in what they came up with.'' But <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> and other residents complain bitterly about the department. `` They've ignored our pleas, and finally we had to go elsewhere to get help,'' <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lucian </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, a laid-off miner, says he has evidence of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> contamination in the palm of his hand _ a recurring scaly patch. He worked for about two years as a security guard during the first cleanup of the site. He says tests have shown his blood contains PCBs. `` Sure, I'm worried. But I'm 62,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who lives 100 yards from the plant. `` I'm worried about the kids around here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> plans to shut <ORGANIZATION> Minden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the end of this school year, saying there are n't enough students to keep it open. But some are sure the board does n't think it's safe to keep children in <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think anybody in our group would say every health problem in <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION> is caused by PCBs,'' <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> said. `` But the health problems are incredible, and the stress of not knowing what to expect _ it's incredible.''

 The centennial of the giant flood that swept 2,209 people to their deaths under a 70-foot wall of water is being marked today with a torchlight pageant and memorials. `` The flood, they say, is an old story. But it is n't.

The <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> flood was the nation's second-worst natural disaster. A tidal wave killed about 5,000 people at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in 1900. Floodwaters from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conemaugh </LOCATION>, a private resort created by wealthy industrialists, broke through a poorly constructed earthen dam on May 31, 1889, after several days of rain. The waters swept 14 miles down the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conemaugh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and slammed into the town of 10,000 people, virtually washing it away in about 10 minutes. A huge pile of debris containing scores of survivors of the flood piled up against the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Railroad's stone bridge, which still stands across the <LOCATION> Conemaugh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> just below downtown, and caught fire, causing more deaths. As part of today's observance, officials are opening a new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> visitors center and the renovated <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> Flood Museum. A memorial is scheduled at Point Stadium near the stone bridge and will include the lighting of a torch, the ringing of church bells, sirens, brief fireworks and a citywide moment of silence. The two living survivors of the flood, <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Frum </PERSON>, 106, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomo </PERSON>, 100, will be the guests of honor at the annual Survivors' Banquet at Christ the Saviour Cathedral in downtown <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>.

Television satellites allow us to bear witness from the shipyards of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to Tiananmen Square. But the momentum for freedom does not just come from the printed word or the transistor or the television screen. It comes from a single powerful idea: Democracy.

And of course, for the leaders of the East it's not just freedom for freedom's sake.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the birthplace of the Cold War. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, at the end of World War II, the Soviet army prevented the free elections promised by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Yalta </LOCATION>. And today, Poles are taking the first steps toward real elections, so long promised, so long deferred. And in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, at last we see a chance for multiparty competition at the ballot box. And as President, I will continue to do all I can to help open the closed societies to the East. We seek self-determination for all of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And we will ... and we will not relax, and we must not waver. Again, the world has waited long enough. But democracy's journey east is not easy. Intellectuals, like the great Czech playwright, <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, still work under the shadow of coercion. And repression still menaces too many peoples of Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Barriers and barbed wire still fence in nations. So when I visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this summer, I will deliver this message: There can not be a common European home until all within it are free to move from room to room. And I'll take another message: The path of freedom leads to a larger home, a home where West meets East, a democratic home, the commonwealth of free nations. And I said that positive steps by the Soviets would be met by steps of our own, and this is why I announced on May 12th a readiness to consider granting to the Soviets temporary waiver of the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions if they liberalize emigration. And this is also why I announced on Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to drop the `` no exceptions'' standard that has guided our approach to controlling the export of technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, lifting a sanction enacted in response to their invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. And in this same spirit ... in this same spirit, I set forth four proposals to heal <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s tragic division, to help <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> become whole and free. First, I propose we strengthen and broaden the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> process to promote free elections and political pluralism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. As the forces of freedom and democracy rise in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, so should our expectations. And weaving together the slender threads of freedom in the East will require much from the Western democracies. In particular, the great political parties of the West must assume an historic responsibility to lend counsel and support to those brave men and women who are trying to form the first truly representative political parties in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, to advance freedom and democracy, to part the Iron Curtain.

<HEAD>Sousuke Uno to be Next Prime Minister, Despite Resistance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> today agreed to become the next prime minister after leaders of the scandal-ridden governing party, bucking stubborn resistance, decided he was the best person for the job, a party official said. Uno, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on official business, agreed in a telephone call to take the jobs of party head and government leader after expressing some reluctance, <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, deputy party secretary-general, told a news conference. `` I am not confident I can handle the job when the party is facing such a difficult time,'' <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as telling him. `` But now that the party is in an unprecedented crisis, I will commit myself for the party.'' <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said leaders of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> decided that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, 66, is `` the most suited candidate as successor'' to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who is resigning to take responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal involving the Recruit Co. Recruit, an information and publishing conglomerate, is accused of seeking favors and influence through political donations and bargain-priced share transactions that benefited leading politicians. Those linked to the scandal include <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor; <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>; and party Secretary-General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>. Uno is not known to have received Recruit money. That and his expertise in foreign affairs were said to be his main selling points. But some opposed Uno because he is a senior member of the party faction of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, during whose 1982-87 tenure most of the Recruit scandal took place. `` I am outraged by this nonsense of giving the country's highest office, which only one person can assume, to a sort of managing director of the <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> company,'' former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>'s announcement. <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>'s name was one of many that surfaced during the long search for a successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said the decision to pick <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was worked out in day-long meetings involving himself; <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>; <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, chairman of the party Executive Council; <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamanouchi </PERSON>, party leader in the upper house of the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament. He said party legislators would probably confirm <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as party leader Friday. The Parliament, where the governing party has a big majority, then will vote on Uno for prime minister. Before <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>'s announcement, a group of 48 younger legislators said party leaders should halt their search for a new prime minister and `` take responsibility'' for the Recruit scandal first _ in effect resign their party posts. `` Now that the party had adopted measures to take responsiblity for the scandal, we demand the party to implement them first,'' said <PERSON> Shizuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` If party leaders are going to neglect responsibility measures and appoint a new prime minister, we are prepared to support our own candidate.'' Party elders such as former prime ministers <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zenko </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> suggested a separation of the jobs of party head and prime minister. The party elders had argued it would be too much a burden for a prime minister to also handle party reform. `` The prime minister has to be one person, but difficulties in the party will not allow one person to handle both the party and the government,'' <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> told reporters. `` I suggested something like a collective leadership in the party.''

 A black woman says racial harassment forced her and her two young children to abandon the first house she ever owned just eight days after they moved in. `` Those people just do n't want me to live there,'' said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, 29. Ms. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>'s assessment was confirmed by some residents of the neighborhood, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions Several said the real estate company never should have shown her a house in an all-white neighborhood and should have warned her that she would not be welcomed there, the newspaper said. `` Blacks start moving in and property values go down and white people start running,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sintic </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They should n't run, in my opinion, but they do and Realtors end up making fortunes. Ms. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> said she moved to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> after being honorably discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. She works for a nonprofit agency that monitors abused and neglected children. She said the problems began May 13, the day she moved into the rowhouse. She said she heard someone make a racist comment when she was moving in, but ignored it. Two days later, she found her garbage can overturned and a fish skeleton on her doorstep. Several days later, she said, rocks were thrown through two windows. `` At that moment, I knew I was n't staying there and I would not be going back,'' <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> said. `` It could be fire next time.'' Neighborhood pizza shop owner <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Borschell </PERSON> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Brunner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which handled the sale of the $ 27,250 rowhouse. `` They made that woman a victim of society,'' he said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> of <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said the company did exactly what laws dictate. `` The woman came in here and wanted to buy a house and we sold her a house. We did not discriminate,'' he said. `` I do n't care what the neighbors say,'' he added. `` They're a bunch of bigots, anyhow.''

<TEXT>
 A bill to restrict the use of untraceable license plates, originally intended for undercover police officers, has been introduced after status-conscious politicians began using the ever-so-secret tags. The issue came to light when state literacy chief <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amico </PERSON> acknowledged and apologized in early May for running up $ 900 in parking tickets on his state car, which was outfitted with confidential plates that even the Registry of Motor Vehicles could n't track. <PERSON> D'Amico </PERSON> chalked up the tickets to `` carelessness and stupidity,'' paid the tickets, turned in his state car and said he hoped the incident would n't hurt his bid for lieutenant governor in 1990. The confidential plates look just like those issued to any other <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> driver. The bill to restrict their use to law enforcement officers was introduced Tuesday by state Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Torkildsen </PERSON>. Since Administration and Finance Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON> issued an internal memorandum April 5 asking all agencies to detail and justify their confidential plates, three cabinet secretaries have turned in their secret tags. <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON>'s agency has given 35 administrative officials permission to retain the plates; 769 plates have been issued to law enforcement officials or other investigatory officers. The administration believes <PERSON> Torkildsen </PERSON>'s legislation should allow exceptions for officials who receive death threats and for investigatory units that are not strictly law enforcement, such as <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigators. For example, Revenue Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> has one of the confidential plates because of the frequent threats he gets as the state's chief tax collector.

<TEXT>
 Soviet bloc allies at East-West disarmament talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> are praising President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals for big cuts in American and Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, media reports said today. `` We were pleasantly surprised by the details of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiative,'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Meiszter </PERSON>, told a plenary session. His comments were reported by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` If his proposals come up for discussion at the conference here, these will be, in our opinion, the most important Western initiatives on arms reduction since the signing of the INF agreement,'' <PERSON> Meiszter </PERSON> told delegates Tuesday, likening the initiative to the 1987 treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles. The talks on Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which started here in March, aim to reduce the element of a surprise attack by establishing a secure and stable balance of conventional forces from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` In compliance with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals, the way is open for a comprehensive agreement on the reduction of the most destabilizing military units,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Meiszter </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seized the initiative in East-West relations Monday by proposing a 20 percent cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a ceiling of 275,000 soldiers on each side, requiring the Soviets to demobilize 325,000 troops on the continent. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on Tuesday proposed limits for conventional armaments in the Central European zone where most deadly weaponry is massed on the continent. East German Ambassador <PERSON> Klaus-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> presented reporters with proposals to cut back on six types of weapons by 1996-97 and limit each side to: 570,000 troops, 420 tactical aircraft, 800 combat helicopters, 8,700 tanks, 7,600 artillery pieces and 14,500 armored troop carriers. Countries included in the proposal are <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from the East and, from the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> chided the West for refusing to include strike aircraft, combat helicopters and manpower in the first agreement on conventional forces. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it wants results soon, proposes first reducing three kinds of weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced limits on tanks, armored troop carrriers and artillery pieces. However, he said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is willing to include all land-based combat aircraft and helicopters.

<HEAD>MAINZ: Iron Curtain.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In fact, it's already begun to part. The frontier of barbed wire and minefields between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is being removed, foot by foot, mile by mile. Just as the barriers are coming down in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, so must they fall throughout all of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Let <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> be next. Let <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> be next. Nowhere is the division between East and West seen more clearly than in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. There the brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor, brother from brother. And that wall stands as a monument to the failure of communism. It must come down. Now, `` glasnost'' may be a Russian word, but `` openness'' is a Western concept. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has always enjoyed the openness of a free city, and our proposal would make all <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> a center of commerce between East and West, a place of cooperation, not a point of confrontation. And we rededicate ourselves to the 1987 allied initiative to strengthen freedom and security in that divided city. This, then, is my second proposal: Bring glasnost to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. My generation remembers a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ravaged by war. And, of course, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has long since rebuilt its proud cities and restored its majestic cathedrals. But what a tragedy it would be if your continent was again spoiled, this time by a more subtle and insidious danger that the chancellor referred to, that of poisoned rivers, acid rain. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s faced an environmental tragedy in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Countries from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> suffered after Chernobyl. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is struggling to save the Black Forest today. And throughout, we have all learned a terrible lesson: Environmental destruction respects no borders. So my third proposal is to work together on these environmental problems, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> extending a hand to the East. Since much remains to be done in both East and West, we ask <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to join us in this common struggle. We can offer technical training and assistance in drafting laws and regulations and new technologies for tackling these awesome problems. And I invite the environmentalists and engineers of the East to visit the West, to share knowledge, so we can succeed in this great cause. My fourth proposal, actually a set of proposals, concerns a less militarized <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the most heavily armed continent in the world. Nowhere is this more important than in the two Germanys. And that's why our quest to safely reduce armaments has a special significance for the German people. To those who are impatient with our measured pace in arms reduction, I respectfully suggest that history teaches us a lesson, that unity and strength are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms control. We've always believed that a strong Western defense is the best road to peace. And 40 years of experience have proven us right. But we've done more than just keep the peace. By standing together, we have convinced the Soviets that their arms buildup has been costly and pointless. Let us not give them incentives to return to the policies of the past. Let us give them every reason to abandon the arms race for the sake of the human race. In this era of both negotiation and armed camps, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> understands that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> bears a special burden. Of course, in this nuclear age, every nation is on the front line. But not all free nations are called to endure the tension of regular military activity, or the constant presence of foreign military forces. We are sensitive to these special conditions that this needed presence imposes. To significantly ease the burden of armed camps in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of solid, verifiable agreements between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. On Monday, with my <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, I shared my great hope for the future of conventional negotiations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I shared with them a proposal for achieving significant reductions in the near future. And as you know, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has now accepted major elements of our Western approach to the new conventional arms negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The Eastern Bloc acknowledges that a substantial imbalance exists between the conventional forces of the two alliances, and they've moved closer to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s position by accepting most elements of our initial conventional arms proposal. These encouraging steps have produced the opportunity for creative and decisive action, and we shall not let that opportunity pass.

<TEXT>
 State law needs to catch up with life-support technology and help avoid another case like that of <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, a distraught father who disconnected his comatose son's respirator at gunpoint, a prosecutor says. `` The <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> case is now closed. But the issues raised by that affair are very much alive,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> said Tuesday as he announced formation of a 43-member task force to recommend legal changes to the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. Legal, medical and religious experts are all represented on the panel, which should help produce a law that more clearly defines roles of patients, family members and doctors in life-and-death decisions, <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, disconnected the life support system for his 15-month-old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital on April 26. He held the baby in his arms until <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> was dead while holding hospital personnel at bay at gunpoint. The boy had been in a coma, considered irreversible by doctors, since choking on a balloon nine months earlier. The hospital had refused family requests to withdraw life support, saying the child was not brain dead. <PERSON> Partee </PERSON>'s office charged <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> with murder, but a grand jury refused to indict him. <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> said the task force will seek legal answers to such questions as when death occurs, under what circumstances life-support equipment can be removed, who decides on such removal, and what procedures to follow before life support is withdrawn. Two members of the panel who appeared at a news conference with <PERSON> Partee </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Serritella </PERSON>, whose firm represents the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said they do not believe a new law should require involving a judge in every case. `` These things are fast-moving,'' <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON> said. `` Imagine the case of a parent of a child in a life-support system and some hysterical situation arises. You mean you have to wait until Monday when the court convenes to do something about it? `` These are the practical and sometimes philosophical questions involved.'' <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> said while some laws concerning life-support do exist, interpretations in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and throughout the country vary widely. The <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> case ended two weeks ago when the young father pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge and was sentenced to conditional discharge and counseling, if needed. No jail time was ordered. The <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, who had said he could not determine the cause of death, ruled <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>'s death accidental after the grand jury decision. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, a house painter, has since said he saw no alternative to his action because his son's continuing ordeal was `` just tearing apart the whole family.''

 The family of hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who turned 50 today, said it was marking his birthday in quiet prayer for the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> envoy. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> will obviously be even more in our thoughts today,'' said his cousin, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. `` I know hundreds of cards will be arriving, as they always do at times like these, from all over the world.'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>'s personal envoy, disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987, in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where he had been trying to secure the release of foreign hostages.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> charged today that the Soviet people are worse off now than they were before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, and he said the president has accumulated so much power there is danger of a dictatorship. The former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss proposed radical changes that would take control of Soviet society away from the 20-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and make the party subservient to the newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, on which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> serves. His proposals also would require the president to submit to an annual nationwide referendum on his performance. In another challenge to traditional <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power, the president of the Latvian republic, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>, proposed making the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 15 republics sovereign states that could decide what functions to give the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, sitting erect on the dais at <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s back, kept a stoic face throughout the speech, scanning the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hall for the deputies' reaction. <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> _ like <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege _ said the republics should be given power over their own resources and `` full state authority.'' <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s sister Baltic state, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, declared itself sovereign last fall, with the right to overturn Soviet laws on its territory. The third Baltic state, <LOCATION> Lituania </LOCATION>, followed <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s lead two weeks ago. `` The promised program and the promises of the past four years have not been met,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said in his first nationally televised speech as a parliamentarian. `` People live worse ... the leadership knows that.'' He said he held <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responsible. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said the Soviet leader had been given `` extraordinary powers'' in the political overhaul that created the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and he suggested <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might be tempted, as past <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chiefs have, to abuse his power. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, obviously sensitive to such charges, promised <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before he was elected last week that he never would take advantage of the increased power of the presidency. But <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> warned, `` We can again be ... under a new totalitarian regime, under a new dictatorship.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, fired from his job as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief in 1987 for criticizing the pace of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to abolish `` all unlawlful privileges for the Nomenklatura _ yes, and in general, strike this word from our lexicon.'' `` Nomenklatura'' refers to the party and government elite, who receive special privileges as a result of their positions or those of their families. He also proposed making medicines and mass transit free for invalids and tens of millions of poor Soviets. His speech came on the sixth day of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' inaugural session. The 17-minute speech was occasionally interrupted by not particularly enthusiastic applause. Members of the party's ruling Politburo were among those who did not clap. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> elected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is also the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, to a five-year term as president. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> proposed that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> be subject to a nationwide vote of confidence each year. He also called for changes in the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on which he serves, saying some occupants have not done their job. Towering over the rostrum at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> proposed a law to regulate the functions of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has held a legal monopoly on power for more than 70 years. Power `` by right should belong to the people, in the form of the organ it elects _ that is, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. Legal limits on the party's prerogatives would be a revolutionary development in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> politics, where for decades party officials have dominated the apparatus of government and turned legislative organs at all levels into docile rubber-stamp bodies. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said his reforms are designed to separate the government and party bureaucracies, get the party out of day-to-day public affairs and let the popularly elected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its standing legislature set policy and law. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s proposal would go considerably further by giving popularly elected lawmakers such as himself the power to limit the party's role. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won more votes than any other deputy elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, with almost 90 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> voters casting ballots for him in March. His fellow deputies initially denied him a seat in elections for the smaller, full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet. But <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was granted a seat Monday after another legislator gave up his seat on condition <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> could fill it. After <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech, Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, elected Monday with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s backing, said: `` I think the party's position in our country is just fine. But <PERSON> Revas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabukashvili </PERSON>, a deputy from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, said the power-transfer proposal might eventually succeed, and he believed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would support it. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying he found it hard to believe the president's statement Tuesday that he knew nothing about a deadly clash between soldiers and pro-independence protesters in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> until the day after it happened. The clash in April resulted in 19 deaths. `` What kind of head of state is he, if he does n't know when the troops start to act?'' <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> asked.

 About 4,000 farmers, workers and students burned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident in effigy today in the first government-sponsored rally since the pro-democracy student movement began six weeks ago. The rally in <LOCATION> Huangcun </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, came as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> authorities pressed ahead with tactics aimed at intimidating and discrediting the 10,000 students occupying central Tiananmen Square. Several people said officials forced them to participate in the 40-minute rally in support of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'s hard-line policies. Also today, about 3,000 pro-democracy students marched from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to city police headquarters, where they held a sit-in to protest the arrests of three labor leaders. They also demanded the resignations of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who imposed martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20 and ordered a crackdown on workers pressing for a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinglu </PERSON>, head of the independent trade union to which the workers belonged, said they were released late this afternoon after being questioned for a day about the new union's activities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s communist government bans all but the official <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. `` Down with kidnapping!'' the students shouted. It was the second straight day of protests in front of the police office. At the government-sponsored rally, demonstrators marched to an outdoor stadium carying banners reading: `` We support <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'' and `` We oppose the small group causing turmoil.'' The event lacked enthusiasm of the demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where hundreds of thousands of people have marched to demand democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. Rally leaders burned an effigy of astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, an outspoken proponent of democracy, but they failed to stir the crowd. Few joined leaders in shouting slogans such as `` Long live the Communist Party!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>!'' Students responded to the slogans with giggles. `` They told me to come, so I've come,'' said one 27-year-old peasant in the crowd. `` To tell you the truth, we were forced to come,'' said an 18-year-old high school student. Some participants said they did not understand the purpose of the demonstration. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Foreign Affairs Office informed foreign journalists of the march and of several others in suburban sections of the capital. Martial law regulations, which have been widely ignored, forbid foreign reporters from covering student demonstrations. At <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s symbolic center of political power, about 10,000 die-hard student protesters entered the 18th day of a sit-in, resisting government demands they disperse. `` We are now basically waiting for the government to take the initiative,'' student leader <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> said. `` Things are pretty calm with us. It's the government who's nervous.'' More than a dozen military motorcycle convoys followed by jeeps sped down the main arteries of the capital, the latest warning that government tolerance was nearing an end. A military source said 200,000 troops surrounding <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been told to `` prepare for winter,'' meaning hardliners are digging in for a long battle with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> moderates who sympathize with some goals of the students. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a reformer and head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, returned to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today a week after reportedly being stopped in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on his way back from a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Chinese sources said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>, who made statements in support of the students while in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was put under house arrest in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. But after several days there he was quoted as giving full backing to the government. The government said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for medical treatment. He was shown on the television news being helped off the airplane by a flight attendant, but otherwise he looked healthy. A government propaganda campaign against the students continued to center on a replica of the Statue of Liberty, called the `` Goddess of Democracy,'' unveiled on Tiananmen Square on Tuesday. The statue faces the portrait of communist Chinese founder <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily, a conservative party paper, was filled with articles and letters incensed about the 33-foot statue. `` We believe our sincere patriotic enthusiasm has been greatly mocked, and our good image tarnished,'' said a letter from five unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> gave prominent play to divisions in the student movement in an interview with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> student leader who accused non-Beijing students of `` power grabbing.''

Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge says the First Amendment's protection of free speech for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens extends to international libel cases, a ruling that could have broad implications for American speakers and authors Ruling in a $ 100 million lawsuit brought by former Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Morarji </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON> said Tuesday that it must be proven that journalist and author <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> intentionally distributed a libelous book in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s lawsuit contends the former prime minister was defamed in <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s book, `` The Price of Power; <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' which said <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> sold state secrets to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Attorneys for 94-year-old <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> sought to recover damages based on the lesser standard of negligence, rather than the `` actual malice'' standard required under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law in libel cases that involve public figures. But <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legal standards will be applied to the case since <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> has acknowledged being a `` public figure.'' The judge added in a written opinion that to apply `` Indian defamation law or any other foreign defamation law at odds with the First Amendment could have a tremendous chilling effect.'' Legal experts say <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON>'s ruling is the first of its kind and signals protections for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authors, speechmakers and publishers whose domestically produced works are later published or distributed abroad. Trial is set for Sept. 13. The 6-year-old lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> under the principle of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the defendant. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, was born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Riot police swinging truncheons today arrested hundreds of students who tried to march to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s Catholic cathedral in support of anti-government hunger strikers About 5,000 riot troopers in helmets and combat fatigues stopped about 1,000 students a few blocks from Myongdong Cathedral in the city center. Police charged into the students several times and dragged away struggling protesters in a confrontation that lasted about four hours. Some students tried to ram through police lines to reach the cathedral, but most demonstrated peacefully. Police said at least 500 students were arrested. Riot troopers kicked and beat some protesters who were hauled away and police said there were injuries among both troopers and students, but said they had no figures. The students marched to the cathedral after 4,000 others took part earlier in rallies at 13 <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges. They called for the resignation of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and protested the death of dissident student <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>, whom they claim was killed and tortured by police. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Bring back <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>!'' students shouted. The campus protests were peaceful except at <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where about 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks. At least six people were hurt, police said. Hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body was found in a reservoir near that city May 10. A government report concluded <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> slipped and fell into the reservoir after fleeing a police roadblock. The report said there was no evidence <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was tortured or that police were involved in his death. Student leaders said hundreds of students today joined the hunger protest at the cathedral demanding the government admit police killed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. About 300 students began the hunger strike last Thursday, but their number dwindled to 60 by Tuesday. Student leaders said about 500 students were now taking part in the hunger strike, but there was no way to confirm the figure. Doctors aiding the students said eight hunger strikers were hospitalized after collapsing and that scores gave up fasting because of weakness. Riot police blocked the hunger strikers and about 300 protesters when they tried to march from the cathedral in a candlelight parade. Lines of police stopped the march, but there was no violence. Some radical student groups have called for peaceful protests after six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campus demonstration. The deaths outraged public opinion in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The South Korean radicals lack broad public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views. Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics as those used by pro-democracy Chinese students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In a related development, news reports today said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will import spray guns that shoot tear gas mixed with water to replace controversial rifles that shoot tear gas canisters. About 230 guns will be imported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to combat the violent protests, according to the daily <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>. Police will also import water cannons from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Police refused comment on the reports. There has been public outcry against police for using the rifles and armored vans carrying multiple tear gas launchers. The straight tear gas has caused injuries and some deaths.

Protesters carried banners reading: `` Bush Go Home,'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Is Not Welcome Here,'' and `` Bush: Hands Off <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Police sealed off traffic across the city's main bridge spanning the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>, and helicopters circled over the hall where the president was speaking. The helicopters drowned out protesters' shouts of `` Police bulls! and `` German police state!'' At one point, about 200 demonstrators broke away from the rally and tried to march toward the <LOCATION> Rheingoldhalle </LOCATION>. A scuffle broke out as police moved to block protesters, and at least one man was handcuffed and led away by helmeted officers. The demonstration ended after about an hour.

 Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says his hiring of his girlfriend for a $ 28,000 a year job on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is ethically sound. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 56, R-Mich., acknowledged Tuesday he has been living with the 28-year-old staffer, <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, since earlier this year Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was hired Jan. 1 on <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' recommendation and he moved into her <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> apartment in late January or early February, shortly after separating from his wife, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` We checked with the ethics committee before we hired her to make sure there was nothing wrong with doing it,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` The answer was very clearly there is nothing wrong with it.'' Disclosure of the relationship between <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and Miss Ball prompted a flurry of accusations between the congressman and his wife of 12 years. The congressman has filed for divorce, and he and Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> have been sparring in court over how much support he should be required to pay. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> accused his estranged wife of leaking the information to reporters in an effort to get more alimony in the divorce proceedings. `` She has threatened me on numerous occasions, ... saying, ` if I do n't get what I want in the way of alimony, I'm going to go public with it.''' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, however, denied she was the source of the information and said she had never threatened the congressman or his staff. `` All I did was just warn them to try to keep him in check because he's going to hurt himself,'' she said. `` I asked what can be done to stop this.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> presented the affair against the backdrop of a stormy marriage, with both parties dating while separated. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, however, said word of the affair caught her by surprise. `` I had no idea,'' she said. `` He traveled so much, I did n't know what he was doing. `` Last spring I got calls from mutual friends asking me if I was OK,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` I could n't figure out why I was getting these phone calls.'' Miss Ball and the congressman first dated in 1987 and had continued their relationship off and on until he began living in her apartment, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Miss Ball would not talk to reporters. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made the information public after learning a newspaper planned a story on the affair, aides said. `` <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> has been up to my district, been with me down here. It is no secret,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` I have not tried to make it a secret.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he escorted Miss Ball to an inaugural ball in January. Miss Ball, who works for the committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee, reviews testimony and prepares questions and statements for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pence </PERSON>, the committee's Republican staff director. He said she has done excellent work. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, in the divorce proceedings, told a judge she needed $ 4,000 a month in support payments for herself and the couple's 5-year-old daughter <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has he ca n't afford to pay that much until $ 112,000 in joint debt has been paid.

 An estimated 1 million people linked hands in the rain today to support the student-led democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, organizers said. They said the human chain, from <LOCATION> Keelung </LOCATION> in the north to <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> in the south, stretched about 240 miles over highways and city streets and was broken only at intersections to allow traffic to pass. Participants, most of them students on their lunch break, sang patriotic songs. In some cities they heard speeches during the 30-minute demonstration. `` Students on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are facing a turning point in history, but they are not alone in shouldering their duties because we are firmly behind them,'' <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien-wei </PERSON>, a student leader at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chengchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told a rally at <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, who died in 1975, was the Nationalist president who led the Nationalists to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after they were defeated in a civil war on the mainland by communist troops. About 3,000 officials and students attended the rally in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. Before today's demonstration, only several small rallies had been held in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to support the Chinese democracy movement. The lukewarm public response embarrassed the Taiwanese government, which continues to claim it is the legitimate ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused a speeded-up ruling on the constitutionality of a voter-approved ban on state-funded abortions for the poor.

The girl's family had challenged the cutoff of about $ 6 million a year for some 18,000 Medicaid abortions.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the May 26 The Morning News Tribune, <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on high school dropouts: <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, not generally considered to be a state at the forefront of bold, educational experiments, has worked a minor miracle: It's come up with a way to cut its high school dropout rate by almost a third. The state has cut its annual dropout figure from 5,000 to 3,400 by threatening dropouts with loss of the most valuable commodity in their young lives: their driver's license. Under a law enacted last year, a student who drops out at 16 loses his license and does n't become eligible to get it again until 18. Students with special situations have the right to appeal the decision, but the state has not granted many exemptions. ... Of course, its approach to cutting the dropout rate would not work in every community or with every student. Many low-income and urban students do n't drive, so threatening them with loss of their license would n't mean much. ... But for many teen-agers, the thought of losing their driver's license just might be enough to convince them to hang in there another year or two and finish high school With an estimated one out of four students failing to graduate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, here's a new idea with a real impact.

It's time for a federal initiative, similar to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s President's Council on Physical Fitness, something to inspire all of us to keep fit and stay healthy.

 May 23 Herald-Dispatch, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on the safety of older planes: Three cheers for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which has taken an important step toward making flying safer Until now, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> policy has been to regularly inspect airliners, looking for signs of cracks, corrosion or metal fatigue. When problems were found, parts were ordered replaced. Last year's <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> accident tragically illustrated the inadequacy of that policy. The aircraft involved, an older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, passed its inspection. But later, in flight over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the top third of the aircraft peeled away. A flight attendant died when she was sucked out of the plane and 61 of the 94 other people on board were injured before the pilots safely landed the aircraft on the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. Since the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has re-examined its safety policies for older aircraft and it's now decided to order many parts replaced at a certain age, regardless of their condition. ... The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> says the new policy will cost the airlines more than $ 140 million over the next few years. But that will be a cheap price to pay if it makes the skylanes safer.

As the third-ranking Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he was certain to be Republican target No. 1 after the expected resignation of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. But what <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> called the predictable `` turmoil'' was only part of it. For all of his fierce attachment to the political life, he is not a time server. He is both ambitious and fatalistic; when he saw a lid possibly coming down on his chances to move up in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy _ and even a prospect that he might have to fight for his present position as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> `` whip'' _ he had no yen to hang on. ... We do not share <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s apparent conviction that he's being besieged simply because of an overheated climate of ethical scrutiny. His problem with an investment in high-yield, high-risk bonds, in which he received financial help from a savings and loan executive, ca n't just be ascribed to a `` mistake'' or a simple failure to accurately report details of the transaction. A reporting glitch aside, the deal itself was unsettling. ... Putting aside the circumstances of his leave-taking, his effectiveness as a representative is beyond challenge.

 May 30 The Evening Sun, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, on health care for the aging: A new report from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging offers a sobering view of the nation's already embattled health-care system. According to the report, two trends are currently at work in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today that will collide early in the 21st century: The population is aging, and the percentage of care-givers is dropping. If does n't take a demographer to realize that if these trends continue unabated, there simply will not be enough nurses and home health care workers. One piece of the equation is unchangeable _ the elderly will make up a larger and larger share of the population. Thanks, in large part, to the demographic glitch caused by the baby-boom generation, the number of senior citizens will swell from the current 29.1 million -LRB- 11.8 percent of the population -RRB- to 54.5 million -LRB- 17.7 percent of the population -RRB- by 2020. And the elderly typically suffer from more chronic illness, need more at-home care and spend more days in the hospital than the overall population. Meanwhile, nursing shortages in hospitals nationwide have more than doubled in the last five years. More than half of all home health-care agencies report difficulties in finding and recruiting health-care professionals. And the shortfall is predicted to continue. The statistics warn of a health-care crisis. Fortunately, though, it can be averted _ through proper planning.

 May 30 The Atlanta Journal on air pollution: During the past two decades of environmental cleanup, industry has been viewed as part of the problem rather than part of the cure. Legislation proposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would change that, offering the business sector reason to become an ally instead of an adversary. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan focuses on setting sulfur emissions limits and then allowing polluters to choose the most cost-effective way to comply.

The nation has made remarkable progress in reducing air pollution using regulation as a stick to coerce compliance, but we've gone about as far as we can go by traditional methods. Now, it's time to offer a carrot to stimulate efforts toward going the rest of the distance.

As gas prices decreased, however, Americans traded their economy cars for new models that offered greater comfort and increased performance, yet demanded more fuel. Already, there's pressure aplenty to increase auto fuel efficiency. ...

 An official appointed to draft an integration plan for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s public colleges recommended eliminating most open-admissions policies and putting all 17 schools under a single governing board. No universities would be closed or merged under the proposal issued Tuesday by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, appointed by a federal panel to come up with a desegregation plan for the 145,000-student system, changed few details from a preliminary proposal issued April 18, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, legal aide to Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. The court will have the final say on the plan. The 17-member board would be appointed by the governor and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and would govern all public higher education in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, replacing four boards that run the 13 four-year institutions and four two-year schools. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> said the board would be responsible for `` insuring that progress toward eliminating <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s racially dual education system is achieved.'' <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> was appointed after the court ruled last year that a 1981 desegregation agreement between the state and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had failed. The plan had called for spending millions of dollars to improve predominantly black Southern and <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> universities. The dispute began 15 years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the state of running a dual system of higher education for blacks and whites. Under the plan recommended by <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> would become the state's flagship institution with the toughest admission standards. A second and third tier of four-year schools with less stringent standards would be set up, while two-year community colleges would continue to offer open admissions and would be responsible for most remedial courses. The more stringent admissions policies are part of the plan's larger goal of improving the quality of higher education in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Currently, all <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> colleges admit all graduates of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> high schools. Fifty-four percent of entering freshmen must take remedial courses. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he did not know if the judges would hear further comment from the parties in the case _ including <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Grmbling alumni _ before deciding whether to approve the plan. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who had pushed for a single board, was pleased by <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>'s recommendation. `` The single board is the linchpin of this whole thing,'' he said. State Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, an attorney for Southern, said he had not seen the recommendation and declined to comment. Other parties were not available for immediate comment. Black leaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to the needs of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>. Some proposals for eliminating racial disparities in the state system included closing some predominantly black institutions.

 Journalists marched in protest in four cities and opposition parties demanded a new investigation on the fifth anniversary of the assassination of a nationally acclaimed reporter, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>. The anniversary Tuesday also marked the end of the statute of limitations in the case, meaning his killers probably never will be prosecuted. As the anniversary neared, there was pressure to find and judge those who killed the tough investigative reporter. But it passed without arrests. <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, who wrote a column called `` Private Network'' for the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION>, was gunned down on a street in the capital's <LOCATION> Zona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> section on May 30, 1984. <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>'s subjects ranged from senior politicians and corrupt cops and union bosses to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.

 The father of a 17-year-old school dropout whose driver's license was revoked under a new law aimed at curbing dropouts and truancy says he plans to give the law its first court test. The 1988 law, the only such statute in the nation, has drawn both criticism and praise from educators, parents and politicians. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, lost his license Tuesday under the law that requires school-age young people who want to drive to stay in school. Means, who dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> a year ago when he was in ninth grade, is married. He was an attendant at a gas station but had to quit when he lost his driver's license. `` There were supposed to be exceptions to this law,'' Means' father, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, said today `` My son is married, he's an expectant father with the baby due in September. They have a house ..., trying to make it on their own. `` With the decision, I see no way for him to gain employment and support his family. If this is n't an exception, I do n't know what is.'' Under the law passed in the summer of 1988, students under age 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days or have 15 unexcused absences must give up their driving privileges. County school systems notify the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> of students who have dropped out. A school superintendent can waive the law if a student's withdrawal from school is beyond the student's control DMV lawyer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> said if Means follows through with the suit, it will be the law's first court test. Means misplaced his license and requested a new one. But the <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION> refused to issue a new license without the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which refused his request. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON> could not be reached for comment; his father said he has no telephone.

 Here are excerpts from <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, as translated by The Associated Press: On devolution of power: At the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the most important question is being decided on which the future of our society depends: the question of power, which by rights must belong to the people in the form of the organ it elects _ that is, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The Central Committee plenum just before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opened did not support my suggestion to transfer power somehow at this very first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from the party to the Soviets -LRB- local parliaments -RRB-. The plenum decided to recommend for leading posts the same people who have not managed to get the society out of crises in politics, the economy, finances, the standard of living. On limited powers of the Congress: The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which had to take into its hands the power for perestroika and the transformation of society, has ended up as hostage to laws and decisions taken by the previous Supreme Soviet, formed back in the times of stagnation. Important questions of state power and administration, which logically ... should have been reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were decided in advance, and it is proposed that we vote in favor of these laws. In these conditions, there is a danger of the Supreme Soviet and its presidium turning into an apparatus, or, let's say, half an apparatus, under the president. The state of the nation: The situation in the country is extremely alarming. Anti-perestroika forces have become active and are consolidating, the shadow economy is growing, corruption and crime are on the rise, the moral standards of society are becoming diluted, the problems of youth are getting sharper ... the principles of social justice and social equality are not being realized, the number of poor people is growing, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people's belief in the real results of perestroika is falling, the contradictions in ethnic problems are getting sharper ... the decisions on the food problem are being delayed. The disorganization of the internal market, inflation, queues, ration coupons, the threat of a financial collapse has become real. The command-administrative system has not been broken. Power still belongs to the party apparatus and the bureaucracy. The vast system of power is profitable only for this apparatus. The promised program and the promises of the last four years have not been fulfilled. People live worse. Such political evaluations of the current moment and some of the self-criticism in the speech of Comrade <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> do not remove him, in my opinion, from responsibility for all of that. On troops attacking protesters in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>: A year after the party conference supporting the course for democratization, we have hit out at meetings and demonstrations with one decree, at glasnost with a second. With a third we approved the use of special forces against our own people. Exactly in this atmosphere of creating extraordinary bans by law, and especially recently, such crimes as in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> became possible. I was there and I am convinced that it was a crime, a crime against our own people. In order to calm people down a bit, it is necessary to say at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who in the center took the decision, since the leadership knows this. On glasnost: To guarantee broader democratization and glasnost, let's not hamper their development, as is already happening. In fact, a law on the press should be adopted, and the mass media should not ... be organs of the party. They should become more and more independent. On priorities: First of all, it is necessary to consider at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies the tasks and goals of the society, and taking them into account to form a commission to work on a draft of a new constitution. I consider it one of the tasks to decisively decentralize power and economy, to dismantle the command-administrative system, which is the source of the menace that we would return to the past. On social justice and the privileged `` nomenklatura:'' Without delay, laws on pensions, on poverty, on ecology and on forms of property should be adopted. In the existing circumstances, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should first of all adopt state programs on how to take the country out of crisis. The program should be a program of urgent measures. For more than 70 years we have not managed to solve the question of social justice. There's every reason to speak of an elite existing in our society, which is building socialism. Why are there tens of millions of people in this country who live below all possible levels of poverty while others bask in luxury? The defense of the less well-to-do and the defenseless layers of society should be made a principle of socialist justice. To begin with, taking into account the deficit, maybe we should cancel all unlawful principles for the `` nomenklatura'' and in general remove from our lexicon this word, `` nomenklatura.'' This would raise the moral level of our society. It is necessary to fix a minimum standard of living, and already at this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> we should decide at least one concrete social issue, otherwise people wo n't understand us. For example, we should create a free supply of medicines, free public transport for the disabled and those below the poverty line, to solve the pension question, at least in part. I hand over to the presidium -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- a legislative initiative drafted and signed by a large group of deputies. Before we solve all issues of medical care, it is necessary to transform the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the special department that provides medical care for the elite -RRB- into a department caring for mothers and their children. This should be done for the sake of our future, in order not to have a situation where infant mortality is twice that of any civilized country. About President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: I can not help voicing here one of my concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, constitution and the party entrusted the head of state with extremely broad authority. Here we can perceive a troubling tendency. Against the background of a deteriorating economy and the sharpening of social issues, we see an increase of personal influence and personal power in the hands of the head of state. This can lead to the temptation to solve our complex problems with force, and we can again find ourselves in the sway of a new authoritarian regime, a new dictatorship, without noticing it. Moreover, for 70 years, we have not accumulated experience, either through the party, parliament, or people, of controlling the activity of the head of state. I think within the limits of building a state based on law, the present <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should create certain collective mechanisms. As one of the elements of such a mechanism, I suggest adopting a law on an annual referendum on people's confidence in the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the president -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today increased benefits for workers and retirees and allotted money for a food distribution plan in an effort to end looting and riots that have killed 11 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, in an all-night session, also ratified a 30-day state of siege declared Monday by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> from his home in the western provincial capital of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION> and met with <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to discuss the crisis and the possibility of an early transfer of power. Officials described major cities as mostly calm this morning following rioting and sacking of stores Tuesday in several <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> suburbs and the city of <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>, the nation's third-largest. Rioting also occurred in the cities of <LOCATION> Mendoza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucuman </LOCATION>. Shops and offices opened today in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The food riots have increased pressure on <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to step down before his six-year term ends Dec. 10, and the country's largest labor coalition and most influential business group on Tuesday asked <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> to take office early. The economic crisis has been caused by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s $ 59 billion foreign debt, a national budget deficit worsened by inefficient state companies and months of inflation that could top 70 percent for May. The inflation has led to layoffs, food and supply shortages and declining real wages that have left retirees living on the equivalent of $ 25 a month. `` The country is dying of hunger. Factories are closing. People are unemployed,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, head of the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said in an interview. Under <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' action today, the minimum pension for retirees will rise to about $ 36 and the minimum for widows to about $ 33. The lawmakers raised the benefits at the insistence of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s labor-based <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> They also allotted an unspecified amout of money to pay for distribution of food and medicine. Civil liberties were suspended under the state of siege declared Monday, but looting of groceries continued. `` Unfortunately, this government has lost its credibility,'' <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, head of the 4 million-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. Confederation officials said an early transition is `` the only possible solution.'' <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Montagna </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> business group, also called on <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to step down early. After the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was defeated in national elections on May 14, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> offered to resign but could not agree with <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> on terms of the transition. Asked Tuesday whether he favored an early transition, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said: `` That would not be opportune in these grave moments the country is going through.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s election in 1983 ended nearly eight years of military dictatorship. The government has blamed ultra-leftist groups for the riots, but has offered little proof. Vice President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> blamed `` groups that do not want to see the current government end its term and another constitutional government begin.'' The latest deaths occurred Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> and Quilmes during a riot in which looters broke windows and emptied shelves in furniture stores, bars, sports and shoe stores. Looters loading food onto trucks threw stones at police, who retaliated by firing rubber bullets, killing four, local news agencies said. A bus driver who tried to prevent the theft of his bus was shot and killed. A sixth person was killed in suburban <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> but the circumstances were not clear, the independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>, a meat-packing city of 1 million, has been worst hit by the unrest. On Tuesday, armed bands reportedly drove through its deserted streets after dark, shot at police stations and looted homes and stores. `` They left practically nothing standing,'' Mayor <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> of the suburban town of <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobernador </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON> said. `` They overwhelmed everything _ supermarkets, shops, shoe stores.'' In <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>, 186 miles north of the capital, four people were shot and killed on Monday and an elderly women died of a heart attack during looting. Schools remained closed Tuesday and most businesses did not open. In all, several hundred stores and shops in more than a dozen cities have been sacked the past week. More than 1,500 people have been arrested, two-thirds of them in <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>. On Tuesday, officials in the provinces scrambled to set up free food programs and the national minimum wage was more than doubled to the equivalent of about $ 57 a month. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, the province that includes <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>, the legislature unanimously approved a disaster law that allows private property and merchandise to be confiscated so food and medicine can be given to the needy.

But once <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> had squared the match, the veteran <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> had a fight on his hands against an opponent 14 years younger. <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> broke him to take a 6-5 lead in the third set and <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>' task.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, chosen Wednesday by governing party leaders to be the next prime minister and lead the government from unprecedented crisis, is seen as an experienced but weak politician. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was the second choice of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to succeed Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Party leaders tried to persuade the party's Executive Council chairman, <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, to take the job, but he refused, citing poor health and dissatisfaction with the party's handling of reforms. Few leaders within the scandal-ridden <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sang the praises of the 66-year-old Uno, and many put forward last-minute alternatives to his nomination, such as collective rather than individual leadership. Many fear he can not win back public confidence in the government, shaken by an influence-peddling scandal that forced <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to step down and led to charges against 17 politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. Analysts speculated that party bosses, who are too tainted by the financial scandal to take the post now, settled on <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as an interim leader who will allow them to exert influence and not upset their future aspirations. Even the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, described Uno, who has been foreign minister since 1987, as only `` a reasonable choice.'' `` Some party leaders would have preferred that the successor to Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> come from the junior ranks in order to revitalize the party. But <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was chosen to maintain party harmony,'' <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. Former prime ministers <PERSON> Zenko </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> suggested a group leadership and expressed fears Uno may be too weak to steer the conservative party to victory in parliamentary elections this summer. Support for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> has fallen to the lowest levels ever, largely because of the scandal in which the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing conglomerate, allegedly won government favors by handing out millions of dollars in political donations and underpriced stock. Though Uno is untainted by the scandal, he is closely allied with former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, under whose 1982-87 tenure the influence-peddling allegedly occurred. The proximity of the two has damaged <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s reputation, and it almost cost him the party nomination, analysts say. On Sunday, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> resigned from the party, partly to relieve pressure on Uno. But supporters say Uno's high-ranking Cabinet posts in a country striving for a stronger international role have made him a familiar figure to the Japanese public, and that in itself will bring votes to the party. Uno has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the Science and <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He is a 10-term member of the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Shiga </LOCATION> prefecture in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Born Aug. 27, 1922, into a wealthy family in <LOCATION> Shiga </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> fought in World War II and served on the Asian mainland before being taken prisoner by Soviet troops in northern <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He and his wife, <PERSON> Chiyo </PERSON>, have two children, a son and daughter.

 Our proposal has several key initiatives. I propose that we lock the Eastern agreement to Western-proposed ceilings on tanks and armored troop carriers. We should also seek an agreement on common numerical ceilings for artillery, the range between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s and that of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, provided these definitional problems can be solved. And the weapons we remove must be destroyed. We should expand our current offer to include all land-based combat aircraft and helicopters by proposing that both sides reduce in these categories to a level 15 percent below the current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> totals. Given the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's advantage in numbers, the pact would have to make far deeper reductions than <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to establish parity at those lower levels. Again, the weapons we remove must be destroyed. I propose a 20-percent cut in combat manpower in U.S.-stationed forces, and a resulting ceiling on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet ground and air forces stationed outside of national territory in the Atlantic-to-the-Urals zone at approximately 275,000 each. This reduction to parity, a fair and balanced level of strength, would compel the Soviets to reduce their 600,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 325,000. And these withdrawn forces must be demobilized. Finally, I call on -LRB- Soviet -RRB- President -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to accelerate the timetable for reaching these agreements. There is no reason why the five-to six-year timetable, as suggested by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is necessary. I propose a much more ambitious schedule. And we should aim to reach an agreement within six months to a year and accomplish reductions by 1992, or 1993 at the latest. In addition to my conventional arms proposals, I believe that we ought to strive to improve the openness with which we and the Soviets conduct our military activities, and therefore I want to reiterate my support for greater transparency. I renew my proposal that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies open their skies to reciprocal unarmed aerial surveillance flights, conducted on short notice to watch military activity. Satellites are a very important way to verify arms control agreements, but they do not provide constant coverage of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An open skies policy would move both sides closer to a total continuity of coverage, while symbolizing greater openness between East and West. These are my proposals to achieve a less militarized <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A short time ago, they would have been considered too revolutionary to consider, and yet today, we may well be on the verge of a more ambitious agreement than <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, than anyone considered possible. But we're also by challenged developments outside of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional areas of concern. Every Western nation still faces the global proliferation of lethal technologies, including ballistic missiles and chemical weapons. We must collectively control the spread of these growing threats. So we should begin as soon as possible with a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. Growing political freedom in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> without barriers, a cleaner environment, a less militarized <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, each is a noble goal. And, taken together, they are the foundation of our larger vision, a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is free and at peace with itself. So let the Soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their legitimate security interests. Our goal is to convince them, step by step, that their definition of security is obsolete, that their deepest fears are unfounded. When Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> takes its giant step in 1992, it will institutionalize what's been true for years _ borders open to people, commerce and ideas; no shadow of suspicion, no sinister fear is passed between you. The very prospect of war within the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is unthinkable to our citizens. But such a peaceful integration of nations into a world community does not mean that any nation must relinquish its culture, much less its sovereignty. This process of integration, a subtle weaving of shared interests, which is so nearly complete in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, has now finally begun in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. We want to help the nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> realize what we, the nations of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, learned long ago: the foundation of lasting security comes not from tanks, troops, or barbed wire, it is built on shared values and agreements that link free peoples. The nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are rediscovering the glories of their national heritage, so let the colors and hues of national culture return to these gray societies of the East. Let <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> forego a peace of tension for a peace of trust, one in which the peoples of the East and West can rejoice, a continent that is diverse, yet whole. Forty years of cold war have tested Western resolve and the strength of our values. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s first mission is now nearly complete. But if we are to fulfill our vision, our European vision, the challenges of the next 40 years will ask no less of us. Together, we shall answer the call. The world has waited long enough. Thank you for inviting me to <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>. May God bless you all. Long live the friendship between <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thank you, and God bless you.

 Israeli troops today shot and killed three guerrillas on the border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army command said. It was the third attempted infiltration in four days. Also today, police in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked targets on the outskirts of the southern city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> in the fifth such attack this year. There were no details on casualties. Soldiers shot and killed a 20-year-old Palestinian in a clash in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and wounded eight other Palestinians in clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. And Israeli news reports said police had detained six Jewish settlers suspected of killing a 13-year-old Arab girl during a rampage through a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village. The army said two Palestinians from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> died of wounds suffered in earlier clashes. It was checking the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports of today's casualties in the occupied territories The border incident occurred near the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Hula </LOCATION>, about a mile west of the Israeli town of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shemona </LOCATION>, said a military spokesman. He said troops spotted the three guerrillas, opened fire and killed them immediately. The spokesman, who can not be identified according to army regulations, said the Israelis suffered no casualties. Security sources said the area has been the site of increased troop activity in recent days, and reporters observed flares there. On Tuesday, a guerrilla was shot to death in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after being spotted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and their south <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia allies east of the Lebanese town of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION>. Troops also killed two guerrillas Sunday after several rockets were fired into the Israeli border town of <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION>. Two more guerillas were captured and two escaped, the army said. Sunday's raid was claimed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the late <PERSON> Talaat </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>'s Damascus-based <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> Arab doctors did not identify the Palestinian reported shot and killed today. The other two Palestinians who died of wounds suffered earlier 14 were identified by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawas </PERSON>, 18, who was shot Tuesday, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Farajani </PERSON>, 15, wounded May 14. Both were shot in the head. The deaths raised to 502 the number of Palestinians killed in the nearly 18-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Twenty-two Israelis have also been killed. The army, meanwhile, has started using a new bullet against Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied lands to help reduce fatalities caused by plastic bullets, the Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper said the so-called `` stun'' bullet is designed not to penetrate the body, but it quoted unidentified army commanders as saying the bullet can kill if fired improperly. It said two deaths have been attributed to the new bullet. The newspaper did not provide further details. An army spokesman declined immediate comment. According to army figures, 77 Palestinians have been killed by plastic bullets since they were introduced 10 months ago, in some cases because the bullets were fired contrary to regulations. Also today, Palestinians throughout the occupied lands observed a general strike ordered by Moslem fundamentalists to protest what they called Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s `` curse against the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.'' The strike referred to a newspaper interview in which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must not make territorial concessions to the Palestinians because `` someone might try to cheat us, to lie to us.'' `` Someone might say, ` Let's cheat the Israelis just like <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> did. -LRB- The Palestinians -RRB- always bring these examples of how <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> used all sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published earlier this month. Police, meanwhile, detained six Jewish settlers accused of killing a Palestinian girl and wounding two others in a rampage Monday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kifil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harith </LOCATION>. The suspects were identified as seminarians at <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Tomb Yeshiva in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 12 miles away. The Hadashot daily said the six would be brought before a judge and charged within a few days.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> marked its second No-Tobacco Day on Wednesday, and its leader said he was alarmed at the rising number of women smokers worldwide. Some countries also marked the day, during which smokers were urged to give up cigarettes and chewing tobacco for 24 hours. The theme of this year's event was `` The Female Smoker, at Added Risk.'' Anti-smokers in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> announced the results of a smoking survey and Soviet scientists appealed to women to quit smoking. Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to an appeal by one deputy to refrain from smoking inside the Palace of Congresses for the day. Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> director-general, said smoking posed greater health risks to women than to men, and urged women not to seek a `` false expression of liberty'' through cigarettes. Women who take birth-control pills face increased risks of heart disease and strokes, and pregnant women endanger the lives of their children, he said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The death rate of women from lung cancer has risen by at least 200 percent since the 1950s, and more than 500,000 women die each year as a result of smoking, according to WHO figures. The number of women who smoke increased markedly and became a concern after World War II. `` It is deplorable that while tobacco consumption by men is clearly decreasing in certain countries, women are becoming the principle target of tobacco advertising,'' <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> said. `` Women are smoking more in a false expression of liberty, equality and intellectual prestige. Unfortunately, advertising is stimulating this tendency,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency singled out for particular criticism cigarette brands aimed exclusively at women and promoted by images and words that imply glamour such as `` ultra-slim'' or `` slender.'' But <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> ruled out an international agreement to regulate tobacco marketing similar to the one already adopted by the agency for baby formula. He said such an agreement would be `` almost impossible'' because of opposition by many of <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s 166 members, including Third World countries dependent on tobacco exports and industrialized countries that receive high tax revenues from tobacco. <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> said he was concerned about the trend in the Third World, where smoking is on the increase, especially among educated women. In a WHO survey of 40 countries, the 10 with the highest female smoking rates were in the Third World. At the top of the list was <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, where 80 percent of adult women smoke, followed by <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with 72 percent, according to the survey. In <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, an anti-smoking group announced the results of a survey conducted in April that showed that about 5 million women in the country chew or smoke tobacco. About 25 million people in the nation of 110 million smoke, according to the group, Adhunik, which means `` modern'' in the Bengali language. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, where 39 percent of the women smoke, topped the list of industrialized countries in <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s survey, followed by the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> with 33 percent. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where 24 percent of the women smoke, ranked 16th out of 25 industrialized countries. WHO has called on doctors to help patients break the habit, especially by setting an example themselves. The agency estimates that 10 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> male doctors smoke; an estimated 42 percent smoke in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 65 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 70 percent in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The agency did not include female doctors in its figures. WHO estimates that about 2.5 million people die each year as a result of smoking.

 Police officers made an exploratory dive into the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> today, a day after the body of the first victim of a bridge collapse was found snagged downriver in debris. The officers were preparing for a search of the river Thursday, the first to be made since last week when storms caused a temporary bridge to collapse, dropping at least two vehicles into the water. Three other victims are missing, authorities believe. The body of a woman was found about five miles from the bridge. The river's flow is still swift and hazardous to divers, Whitewater Township Fire Chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said. However, the water level has dropped to about 10 feet, down from the 23-foot level when the bridge collapsed at rush hour Friday evening. Meanwhile, the firm that designed the bridge raised questions about its stability before it was built because the contractor was allowed to alter the plans, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Obermeyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, managing partner of the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> design firm of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Obermeyer </PERSON> and Partners, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> his firm questioned the altered design at a meeting and in a letter to <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Engineer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>'s office last year. `` Our design was heavier and had longer spans ... but nobody really envisioned that -LRB- the collapse -RRB- would happen,'' <PERSON> Obermeyer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said he was aware of <PERSON> Obermeyer </PERSON>'s concerns about the alternative design, which cut the cost and time needed to build the temporary span, but said the plans met the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s standards. Recovery teams used sonar Tuesday to detect what appeared to be two vehicles on the river bottom near the bridge. The currents remained too strong to allow divers into the water, and officials said they probably wo n't send divers in before Thursday. Authorities did n't release the identity of the woman whose body was found, but they said she met the description of a missing person. Before the body was found, police had received reports from relatives of four people missing, according to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weikel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The temporary bridge opened Dec. 15 to carry traffic while a 94-year-old bridge is rebuilt a few feet away. Officials said the strong currents in the river, which crested seven feet above flood stage over the weekend, and the pounding from debris probably caused the collapse.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today asked <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to extradite financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> to face racketeering and other charges related to alleged thefts from the Philippine government by <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> received the 243-page extradition request today and was studying it, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, 54, a Saudi financier and arms dealer, has been imprisoned in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> since he was arrested April 18 at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments charge <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, a jet-setter once reputed to be among the world's richest men, with helping former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, hide the purchase of more than $ 100 million dollars in real estate and art allegedly acquired with money stolen from the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, is accused of posing as owner of the assets. There was no comment from <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s Swiss lawyer, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zloczower </PERSON>, on the extradition request. A woman identifying herself as his secretary answered the phone at the lawyer's office and said he had no statement. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s attorneys said after his arrest that they would fight extradition. The charges cited in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request were not detailed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. They must be criminal offenses under Swiss law for <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> to consider extradition. Assuming Swiss authorities do not dismiss the request, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> will be granted a hearing, the statement said. If <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> grants extradition, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> can appeal the decision to the Swiss supreme court, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>. He could be extradited `` within five to 10 days'' if he does not appeal, the ministry said. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, known for big deals and an alleged central role in the Iran-Contra affair, is charged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with racketeering, obstruction of justice and mail fraud. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The indictments alleging cover-up of the Marcos-controlled assets name the Marcoses, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, five other people and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bank. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> note that touched off <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s arrest at a <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> hotel cited four buildings in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and a collection of paintings that disappeared from a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> museum. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> allegedly bought them for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as part of `` obfuscation maneuvers'' during the ex-president's 20-year rule in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Swiss officials said. The Philippine government claims that after the Marcoses went into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1986, their agents and <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> carted away 25 paintings from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> properties owned by the Marcoses. The action allegedly came after a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> federal judge froze the Marcoses' property. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> allegedly sold 12 paintings for $ 3.2 million. He was indicted in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> case in October in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> on March 24, according to the Swiss. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> became known for a flamboyant lifestyle and business talent before reportedly hitting financial straits in recent years. He figured in several kickback scandals where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft manufacturers paid him for arranging billion-dollar defense contracts. He reputedly was the main financier and broker in the Iran-Contra affair, where proceeds from the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were funneled to rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government. Under a U.S.-Swiss treaty, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had 60 days after <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s arrest to file a full extradition request to elaborate on charges cited in the embassy's initial note.

 The government towed a boatload of 168 Vietnamese refugees to a remote island Wednesday in the second such initiative aimed at discouraging new arrivals to the British colony. The latest refugees joined 109 Vietnamese who on Tuesday were taken to <LOCATION> Tai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION>, an island 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The government said all usual refugee facilities were filled by the 2,300 boat people who flooded <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in the last three days. The refugees were told not to leave their boats, according to a police spokesman. Marine police were to provide the Vietnamese with food, water and security until the government can find a place for them, the spokesman said. He said he did not know how long that might take. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> received hundreds of thousands of Indochinese boat people after communist forces defeated the U.S.-backed governments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in April 1975. Thousands of Vietnamese still flee their homeland. A year ago, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> adopted a screening policy that treats all Indochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fled political persecution. Despite the policy, however, the influx continues. Since June 1988, more than 20,000 boat people arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and only 1,600 have been screened, according to a government statement. The number of boat people in the British colony is 23,593, the statement said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has agreed to attend an international conference on Indochinese refugees that is to be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> June 13-14.

<HEAD>Police Attack Students at Protest, Arrest 600</HEAD>

 Riot police wielding truncheons arrested more than 600 radical students who tried to march to the Roman Catholic cathedral on Wednesday to support anti-government hunger strikers. About 5,000 troopers stopped 1,000 students a few blocks from Myongdong Cathedral in the city center. Police charged into the column of protesters several times, dragging away struggling students in a confrontation that lasted four hours. Although most protesters were peaceful, some tried to ram through police lines to reach the cathedral, where at least 60 students are staging a hunger strike. Some riot police kicked and beat screaming demonstrators as they were hauled away. Police said there were injuries among the troopers and students but said they had no figures. Earlier, 4,000 students took part in rallies at 13 <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges calling for the resignation of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. They also want the government to admit responsibility in the death of radical student <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>, who they say was tortured and killed by police. A government report said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> died when he slipped into a reservoir while fleeing troopers and there was no evidence of police torture. The students shouted `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Bring back <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>!'' The campus protests were peaceful, except at <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks. At least six officers and students were hurt, police said. Hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police in southern <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, near where <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body was found in a reservoir on May 10. About 300 students began the hunger strike May 25 to demand the government admit that police killed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, but their number had dwindled to about 60 on Tuesday. Student leaders said Wednesday more students joined the strike and 500 were participating, but there was no way to check that figure. Doctors said eight fasters were hospitalized after collapsing and scores began eating because of weakness. On Wednesday night, riot police blocked the hunger strikers and about 300 protesters when they tried to march out of the cathedral for a candlelight parade. Lines of police stopped the march, but there was no violence. Some radical students have called for peaceful protests after six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campus demonstration. The deaths outraged public opinion in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The radicals lack public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views. Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics as those used by Chinese students in the pro-democracy protest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest dissident group, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, Wednesday announced plans to become a full-fledged political party. The movement _ about 200 minor dissident groups with an estimated total membership of 400,000 _ has led many violent demonstrations against the government, which it labels as dictatorial. It has weakened considerably in recent months after most of its leaders, including co-chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bu-young </PERSON>, were either arrested or driven underground by police.

 Stolen art works could pour into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> art dealer wins a lawsuit over four sixth century Christian mosaics, an attorney for the Cypriot government said. `` If all it takes to bring stolen art into this country is an empty head and a round-trip ticket to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the flood gates are open,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said Tuesday, the first day of a lawsuit in federal court pitting a suburban art dealer against <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said art dealer <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> had tried to claim that her inexperience in the international art trade legitimized her purchase of the stolen mosaics, which once graced the walls of a church in the northern village of <LOCATION> Lythrankomi </LOCATION>. `` This is a case about a woman who fell in love with a work of art,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s attorney. He added that his client had sought to determine if the mosaics were stolen before purchasing them. Analysts have said the case could set a precedent governing international trade in national art treasures. The mosaics are the work of an unknown artist and depict <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a boy, the apostles <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON>, and an archangel. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> paid $ 1.2 million for the mosaics in July 1988 to <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON>, a Turk living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> government knew in 1982 that <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON> had been linked to art thefts from northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which is under Turkish control, and could have pursued him earlier to recover the mosaics. <PERSON> Athanasis </PERSON> <PERSON> Papageorghiou </PERSON>, acting director of Cypriot antiquities, testified Tuesday that he knew of <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON> through news reports but had no way of stopping him. During testimony today, <PERSON> Papageorghiou </PERSON> reviewed a list of 28 people his department had notified about the missing mosaics in 1980. The 28, from around the world, `` were specialists in Byzantine art and in all probability they could be contacted if something was for sale,'' he said. Asked about efforts the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> government had made to recover the mosaics, <PERSON> Papageorghiou </PERSON> said he was told government officials had not contacted <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> because they needed the name and location of the smuggler. <PERSON> Papageorghiou </PERSON> said the removal of the mosaics was part of a widespread pattern of looting in churches in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which since 1975 has been controlled by the self-designated <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` Many churches are looted, museums are looted, private collections are looted. We have suffered much,'' <PERSON> Papageorghiou </PERSON> said. He testified that the government was informed the mosaics were missing in November 1979 and had notified the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, museums and other organizations. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> ruled that the Turkish Cypriots could not intervene in the case because their government was not recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The case could rest on whether <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> diligently sought the return of the mosaics, and whether or not <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> showed good faith in trying to determine if the works were stolen. Also important was whether the sale would be governed by Swiss law or more stringent <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> laws regarding stolen property. <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said evidence would show the sale was finalized in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law should apply because four <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> residents stand to profit from the sale of the mosaics, an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bank authorized the loan for the sale, and the mosaics were in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> only a few days en route to their final destination. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> has said she checked a stolen art registry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and customs officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and Turkish <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> before buying the mosaics. `` She does not recall the name of a single official to whom she spoke,'' <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said. `` She never called <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> or the Church of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> does appear to be in quite a hurry in this transaction.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today ordered the explusion of two Nicaraguan diplomats in retaliation for the ouster of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> last week. The Nicaraguan Embassy was informed that the presence of <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigil </PERSON>, both minister counselors, `` was no longer acceptable to the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' department deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. They were given 72 hours to leave the country. Last Thursday, the Sandinista government expelled <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassman </PERSON>, economics officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barmon </PERSON>, a regional labor attache from the embassy in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> who was on a visit to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. They were accused of inciting Nicaraguan school teachers to join a wildcat strike. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> waited six days before expelling the two Nicaraguans in hopes that the Sandinista government would reverse `` its unwarranted, unjustified expulsion'' of the two Americans. He said the Nicaraguan government chose not to reconsider its decision, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reciprocated by expelling <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> and Vigil. <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the two envoys had arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just 10 days ago.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies have patched up an unsettling quarrel over short-range missiles and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has come to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and declared <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> friendship with the Germans. The two events have lifted Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> out of the political doldrums and given West Germans a feeling of pride and emerging prominence. And in two weeks, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will be welcoming President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a summit. It is a dramatic change. Only a few days ago West Germans were in a quandary about the corner they'd painted themselves into: challenging <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by insisting on negotiations to remove short-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> produced an compromise agreement and allowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to conduct their two-day summit like best friends. `` The relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> has never been better,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said repeatedly during his visit. The leaders referred often to the first years after World War II, stoking the emotional embers still burning in many older West Germans who recall the American role in rebuilding their nation after the fall of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. The nostalgic theme struck the chord it intended, compounding West Germans' satisfaction over the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> success with a reassurance that the Americans are still on their side. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit was a time of celebration for West Germans, who are at once pleased to have made their point with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners and relieved that it did n't cost them any standing with the alliance. While many West Germans are opposed to nuclear weapons in their country, they are fearful of isolation and vulnerability should they stray too far from their traditional allies. `` No nukes, no troops,'' is the warning one senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official says he has delivered to West German authorities. It raised the possibility that if the battlefield nuclear weapons are removed the thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British soldiers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would soon follow. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> compromise seemed to blow away the concern, and it was all smiles at the high-profile presidential visit. Larger than expected crowds of well-wishers turned out to greet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, at their public appearances, carried live on nationwide television. The president's announcement that West Germans would no longer need visas to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> drew thunderous cheers. `` A Gift From <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for All Germans,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper gushed in a banner headline, referring to the visa announcement. It forecast a rosy arms control future, declaring `` Now Peace is Really Taking Off.'' West Germans, who often seem insecure about their standing in the world, appeared to be relishing the international prestige bestowed on them by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit and their role in resolving the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> expressed satisfaction with the accord on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense strategy that put off for at least two years a controversial project to upgrade the nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took care to share the limelight _ declaring the compromise a victory for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, not for any single point of view. The chancellor has pointed out repeatedly since the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> accord that he will soon be talking over the new alliance position with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The Kremlin leader arrives in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on June 12 for a four-day visit that West German officials look forward to as a chance to keep the disarmament momentum going. The chancellor said in a speech in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit that West Germans `` see a historic chance to overcome the tensions between East and West.'' But making clear which side of the European divide <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> stands on, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` We will never allow our commitment to the alliance to waver. Our future does not lie somewhere in no man's land between East and West. Our future lies in the community of free peoples.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party has recently suffered in opinion polls and regional elections because of a general drift to the left among voters. His popularity sunk to a dangerous low during the missile dispute, when he appeared to take the stand against <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in response to public pressure. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said privately during the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> summit that the compromise reached in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> was engineered by the Americans to rescue <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> from his political woes. Should <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> lose power during the federal elections in December 1990, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would likely be confronted with a coalition of liberals more skeptical of American and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policies. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> seemed to acknowledge the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> outcome as a gift, thanking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for making it possible. An unusually ebullient <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the press as `` a proven friend who has always stood ready to help me in difficult times.'' Asked by reporters whether the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> compromise would improve his re-election chances, the chancellor who usually bristles at such questions beamed and declared confidently: `` I am completely certain as to the results of the elections in 1990.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today challenged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to bury the Cold War by ending the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, starting by tearing down the Berlin Wall. `` Let <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be whole and free,'' he declared. In a major speech clearly aimed at Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president said popular demands for democratic reforms are sweeping through the communist world, forcing a re-examination of Cold War fears and security precautions. `` The Cold War,'' he said, `` began with the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It can only end when <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is whole.'' Triumphant after his debut at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the president spoke in the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> before an audience in the Rheingoldhalle theater. Four blocks away, about 250 demonstrators protested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit under a heavy police guard. The protesters waved banners and placards reading `` Bush Go Home,'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Is Not Welcome Here'' and `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ Hands Off <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The main bridge spanning the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was sealed off, and helicopters circled the hall where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. In the capital of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, boats crammed with security agents in diving gear watched over the nearby <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a farewell visit to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. `` Youth are the world, and I hope what happened within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> guarantees the future,'' the president told several hundred flag-waving Americans and West Germans who massed on the ambassador's lawn. It was his first and only major address during a week-long trip to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. After today's speech and a cruise down the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for talks with Prime Minster <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who greeted him at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as a band played marching tunes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals for cutbacks in conventional East-West troop levels and armaments drew another positive response from Soviet officials today. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that `` we ask for a timeout to study it, but the initial reaction is positive.'' The central theme of the <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> speech was a call for freedom and democracy for all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The world has waited long enough,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who plans to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in July. `` The time is right. Let <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be whole and free. `` In the East, brave men and women are showing us the way,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Look at <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have won legal status. The forces of freedom are putting the Soviet status quo on the defensive. `` In the West, we have succeeded because we have been faithful to our values and our vision. But, on the other side of the rusting Iron Curtain, their vision failed.'' He said that nowhere is the division between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> more obvious than in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where Communist authorities erected a wall of concrete and barbed wire in 1961 in an effort to halt the flow of refugees to the West. `` There, a brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor and brother from brother,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That wall stands as a monument to the failure of communism. It must come down.'' He issued that challenge as part of a series of proposals `` to heal <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s tragic division, to help <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> become whole and free.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> should become a center of commerce and cooperation instead of confrontation. `` Bring glasnost to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' he declared. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the West and East should cooperate to foster free elections in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and he offered Western technical training and other steps to help the East cope with environmental problems that threaten both sides. Recalling the measures he proposed at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit for cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet combat troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his call for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies to open their skies to reciprocal, unarmed aerial surveillance flights to monitor military activities. He also called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. Summing up, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Growing political freedom in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> without barriers, a cleaner environment, a less millitarized <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ each is a noble goal. `` Taken together, they are the foundation of our larger vision, a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is free and at peace with itself,'' he said. `` Let the Soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their legitimate security interests,'' the president said. `` Our goal is to convince them, step by step, that their definition of security is obsolete, that their deepest fears are unfounded.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the very concept of a divided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was `` under siege _ not by armies but by the spread of ideas'' that began in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, the birthplace of <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutenberg </PERSON>, inventor of the printing press. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the power of democracy was `` sweeping across <LOCATION> Eurasia </LOCATION>. This one idea is why the communist world, from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, is in ferment.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told leaders of the Eastern bloc they were `` unleashing a force they will find difficult to channel or control: the hunger for liberty of oppressed peoples who have tasted freedom.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Tuesday after the two-day summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, and conferred today with West German leaders before the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> cruise. An upbeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the summit meeting `` a double hit'' because it produced a united allied front on short-range nuclear weapons and favorable reaction to his proposal for cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet combat troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 on each side. At a post-summit news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a more than 3-1 advantage in short-range tactical nuclear missiles over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces. `` Why do n't they just unilaterally reduce to equal numbers?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Now, there'd be a good challenge.'' The communique winding up the 40th anniversary <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit contained a compromise specifying that only a `` partial reduction'' in battlefield nuclear weapons would be pursued with the East. That limited step was a setback for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which had sought early U.S.-Soviet negotiations with the possible aim of eliminating the missiles both in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the tilt toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position, the Germans did not leave the summit empty-handed. On a related issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> agreed to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s demand for a delay in modernization of the U.S.-built Lance missile launchers, which are deployed mostly in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In a televised interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was encouraged overall by initial Soviet reaction to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s stand on short-range missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismised a complaint from <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s communique links negotiations on nuclear weapons to reductions in conventional forces. `` The West will not let Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> dictate the terms of any discussion,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I would encourage the Soviets in a spirit of good will to come forward and talk and not try to dictate some terms through a spokesman.''

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> agreed Wednesday to become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next prime minister, at the behest of a governing party crippled by scandal and divided by the choice. The Liberal Democrats turned to Uno, 66, after elder statesman <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> refused the job. Uno was attending a meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and agreed by telephone, apparently with some reluctance, to become head of the party and to replace Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, deputy secretary-general of the party, appeared at a news conference and quoted <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as saying: `` I am not confident I can handle the job when the party is facing such a difficult time, but now that the party is in an unprecedented crisis I will commit myself for the party.'' <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said party leaders decided <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was `` currently the most suited candidate as successor'' to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. The prime minister is resigning to take responsibility for the Recruit influence-buying scandal, which stained the top ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy. Opposition within the party indicated Uno may have a difficult time even if gets the expected approval from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have a large majority. Some oppose the foreign minister because he is a senior member of the party faction of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, during whose tenure in 1982-87 the scandal developed. `` I am outraged by this nonsense of giving the country's highest office, which only one person can assume, to a sort of managing director of the <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> company,'' former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> told reporters. `` I am totally amazed.'' <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, 84, had lobbied against Uno. His own name was one of many mentioned as possible candidates during the long search. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group, said: `` The Recruit scandal involved corruption during <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s administration. It is ... a violent act to appoint one of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s aides as the next prime minister.'' Business leaders welcomed the choice, noting that Uno has gained international experience as foreign minister since November 1987 and has not been touched by the scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> need someone with a clean image to boost their popularity before elections this summer for half of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house. It has taken more than a month to find such a person after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced April 25 that he would resign. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, the 75-year-old chairman of the party executive council, was a popular first choice, but turned the job down May 13 on grounds of poor health and dissatisfaction with how the party was handling political reform. Once <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> had refused, the search was complicated by the fact that so many party leaders had received political donations or profitable stock deals from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate accused of buying favors and influence. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s name emerged last weekend as the choice of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, then the collective leadership became involved. <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said the decision was reached in meetings Wednesday involving himself; <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>; <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, chairman of the party policy committee, and <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamanouchi </PERSON>, party leader in the upper house. He said it was endorsed by the party secretary-general, <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, who is hospitalized after gall bladder surgery. Resistance to Uno appeared to be spreading Wednesday. A group of 48 younger party members said the leaders, rather than choosing a new prime minister, should take responsibility for the scandal by resigning their party posts. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the group planned to put up its own candidate for the party leadership. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Zenko </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON>, head of the party's fifth-largest faction, said the public might not accept <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> because of his ties to <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> resigned from the party because of the Recruit scandal, but he has retained his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and analysts expect his influence to continue. <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> had argued for separation of the jobs of party chief and prime minister.

 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> screened six rare anti-Nazi films made in 1942 and 1943 for the first time in more than 40 years during an international animated film festival Wednesday. The six clips, starring <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> characters, have been carefully preserved and locked up at the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> studios since the war. The 1943 clip `` Victory Through Air Power,'' based on a book by Maj. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Seversky </PERSON>, depicts the importance of strategic air bombing to Allied victory. Another cartoon shows <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> dreaming he is condemned to live in <LOCATION> Nazi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. And in `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> Gets Drafted,'' the famous duck and his friend, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, join the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The clips will be shown again at a retrospective exhibition in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in November before they are returned to the studios for safekeeping. Disney is aware of the extremely nationalistic content of the clips and their use of stereotypes. `` It is absolutely acceptable to present these films from the war period to professionals, to people able to appreciate this type of animation in its context, but it would n't be right to reproduce them on cassettes or to edit them for the public,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> Senior Vice President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` That would not reflect the spirit of Disney today,'' he added. `` <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> has always had a progressive image, and one must situate these clips in their right context, which is during a special wartime period,'' he said. Only a thousand or people will be able to see the one-time screening of the six cartoons. The festival officials received more than 3,000 requests, mostly from professionals, to attend the event. According to <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lux </PERSON> <PERSON> Xibera </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Annecy </LOCATION> festival, the presence of Disney films in such an event is an event in itself. `` Except for retrospectives, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> has never accepted,'' he said. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the studio's presence at the invitation of the organizers is part of a new policy, and it would participate in other similar festivals. The Animated Film festival ends Thursday. This year, 215 films were selected out of more than 900 for the competition.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Soviets have taken advantage of relaxed travel restrictions to come <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to buy goods that are unavailable at home, the Hungarian news agency reported Wednesday. Four new border stations were opened on the Hungarian-Soviet border March 1, and most restrictions on travel for people living in the border area were lifted. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has introduced some of the most liberal travel laws in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, allowing its citizens to travel as often as they can afford to. Other East bloc countries still restrict travel of their citizens to other Soviet bloc countries. According to the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, authorities expected no more than 350,000 people to cross the Soviet-Hungarian border before the end of the year. In the first three months, however, 1.5 million people have crossed the border, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Customs officials processed 98,000 passports on a single day recently, 90 percent of which were Soviet, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Shops in the border area have insufficient stocks of items in high demand among Soviet tourists: toothpaste, soap, deodorant, margarine and brandy, it said. The news agency compared the onslaught of Soviet shopping tourists to the `` invasion'' of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in recent months by Hungarian shoppers stocking up on electronic items and household appliances. Nearly 1 million Hungarians traveled to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in the week preceding the introduction of new customs regulations in April. There are too few currency exchange offices and gas stations in the Soviet-Hungarian border area, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Makeshift markets have appeared in parking lots near the border where money can be exchanged on the black market and some goods are sold from car trunks, the news agency said. Officials are to meet this week to discuss the opening of more border-crossing stations, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Study Finds AIDS-Infected People May Elude Standard Screening Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 People at high risk of catching AIDS may silently harbor the AIDS virus inside their bodies for years while appearing on standard blood tests to be free of infection, research has found. The study found that one-quarter of a group of homosexual men who engaged in risky sex were infected but produced no telltale antibodies that ordinarily are the hallmark of AIDS virus exposure. Health officials check for these antibodies, produced by the body in reaction to an infection, to make sure that blood transfusions and organs for transplants are free of the lethal virus. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, an AIDS expert familiar with the research, cautioned that the discovery `` raises the sobering possibility'' that people with silent infections may pass on the virus through blood and organ donations. However, Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolinsky </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a co-author of the study, said that even if they can transmit the virus, he believes the blood supply is safe because people at high risk of AIDS have already voluntarily stopped donating blood. Antibody screening of large population groups also is used to gauge how many people are infected with HIV, the AIDS virus and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans carry the virus. But the latest research `` means that the infection could be considerably more widespread than we anticipated,'' <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> said in an interview. The new work found that HIV can permanently insert itself into the genes of blood cells but stay hidden so the body never attacks it with antibodies. People may make no AIDS antibodies for three years _ and perhaps much longer _ after they become infected. `` The prevalence of this is not known, but it certainly says there's a possibility of a silent reservoir of HIV infection,'' said <PERSON> Wolinsky </PERSON>. The research was directed by Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Imagawa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine It was based on 1,637 homosexual men in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who were enrolled in the study in 1984 and 1985. Among them were 133 men who had no AIDS antibodies but continued to engage in risky anal sex. In test tubes, their white blood cells were stimulated to grow. This released any AIDS virus hidden inside the cells so it could be detected. They found that 31 of the 133 had silent AIDS infections. While four of these men eventually began to produce AIDS antibodies, the rest did not for followup periods ranging up to three years. While the study raises concern about the effectiveness of current screening tests, there is also a bright side to the finding. `` The good news is that at least some fraction of people, when exposed, seem to control the infection,'' said <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON>. `` We would guess that as long as it stays in that controlled state, people are going to stay healthy. It gives us a new target to shoot for in terms of therapy.'' How long this quiet state of infection may last is unclear, although <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> speculated that it might be life long for some people. The report may also help answer one of the mysteries of the AIDS epidemic _ why about half of the long-time sex partners of infected homosexual men do not appear to catch the virus. <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> said the new work suggests that a substantial number of these people may harbor silent infections.

 Representatives of the progressive Baltic republics challenged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s traditional notion of tight central control Wednesday by pressing the new parliament to endorse their campaign for sovereignty. The most radical demand to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies came from <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, who said the Soviet Constitution should be changed to ensure that the 15 republics _ not the central government _ hold the major powers. `` Only a republic can delegate power to the union because the republics created the union,'' said <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>, a reform-minded protege of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> leader proposed recognizing the 15 republics to be sovereign states with the power to control their own resources, make their own laws, and conclude a new agreement of union. The two other Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, already have defied <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by declaring themselves sovereign with the right to overturn Soviet laws. <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> said a revision of the power structure is needed `` to eradicate the roots of ethnic tension.'' `` <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> is a union, a multinational state, formed on the basis of agreement by equal republics, with self-determination of nations,'' he said. The three Baltic nations were incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940 under a secret protocol between Nazi <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, and some residents and local officials have called for the renunciation of the agreement. In a speech, <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> demanded the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> reveal the `` historical truth'' about the pact. He also complained that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucrats are preventing the Baltic republics from carrying out plans for economic independence. The highest-level comment on <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>'s radical proposals came from <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, elected Monday as vice president. He said the proposals may go too far in distancing the republics from the central government. `` There should be a melting of centralism, republican self-management and local management,'' <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> said in an interview. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s premier, <PERSON> Indrek </PERSON> <PERSON> Toome </PERSON>, stressed economic independence in his speech to the 2,250 deputies, not mentioning his republic's demand for veto power over laws passed in central bodies He said some people were trying to distort the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>' demands. `` What I mentioned does not mean the desire to somehow separate from the all-union problems, although some people try to attach this to us. Such an accusation is not serious because the closed economiy is doomed. On the contrary, integration between the republics and regions must deepen,'' <PERSON> Toome </PERSON> said.

The mayor released a letter in which he asked Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> to appoint <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a former prosecutor, as a special assistant attorney general to look into the accusations. `` This investigation will focus on whether certain persons engaged in criminal solicitation, conspiracy, attempted bribery and-or obstruction'' of the city's governmental operations, the letter said. <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> said the city would pay <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>' expenses but that his investigation would be independent. Requests for the appointment of a particular prosecutor are not that unusual, said <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON>, adding that the attorney general was not immediately available to comment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> has said that <PERSON> Moussalem </PERSON>'s allegations are too absurd to merit comment <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>'s special counsel, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` have a conflict of interest in this. It would be a conflict to prosecute <LOCATION> Moussalem </LOCATION> and use him as a material witness in another matter.'' A federal grand jury indicted <LOCATION> Moussalem </LOCATION> on May 1 on charges that he tried to bribe undercover agents to call off tax audits and investigations. <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> released a copy of a Nov. 23 letter from <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moussalem </LOCATION> that offered favorable consideration of his criminal charges in exchange for his cooperation and immunity for any acts he committed under federal direction. `` Unfortunately a number of black elected officials have been put under a cloud without criminal charges against them,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` We just want to get to the bottom of it and find out what is going on.'' He also said that `` there appears to be a concerted effort to discredit and taint through innuendo certain black officials.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said that `` we want to find out the truth, no matter who may be affected. Somebody is lying and we need to find out who's lying.

<HEAD>Time Magazine Apologizes for Ad Featuring Nazi Insignia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Time magazine published a full-page apology Wednesday for an advertisement in its British edition that featured faded red swastikas and the slogan: `` Poor use of color can ruin your presentation.'' The magazine blamed it on `` a lapse,'' while the advertiser and the ad agency admitted bad judgment and regretted any offense. The full-page ad in last week's edition was placed by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presentation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> firm that offers expertise in image enhancement through graphics. It showed the kind of microphoned podium used by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leaders to address crowds, with two large swastikas in the background. `` Using inappropriate colors can completely take the edge off an aggressive presentation,'' the ad said in part, offering to show `` How special effects can excite a flagging audience'' and `` How symbols can be used to explain ideas.'' `` We ca n't promise to get your name in the history books, but it should find its way into a client's notebook,'' the ad said. <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presentation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` obviously a terrible error of judgment on behalf of us and our advertising agency. We wrongly were n't aware of the distress that it would cause a lot of people.'' The ad gave the company's telephone number, and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he received complaining calls, `` enough for us to feel that it was offending far too many people.'' <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Carstens </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tilbey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leeves </PERSON>, the agency that wrote the ad, said: `` We thought the humor would in fact ridicule the topic. ... The intention was not to offend anybody and insofar we have offended a section of the community, we are sorry. It was an error of judgment.'' He said the company received about 14 complaints. The ad appeared only in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s British edition, which sells 66,000 copies. The apology, signed `` Time, the weekly newsmagazine,'' said: `` It understandably offended many readers. Time maintains strict procedures for acceptance of advertising materials, but, regrettably, our system failed to prevent the appearance of the advertisement. We apologize for the lapse.'' <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandford </PERSON>, in charge of Time's British sales, said the ad `` kind of slipped through the system.'' It arrived late and went straight to the printer in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, she said. Like all Time International material, the ad was sent to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters for approval, but the reproduction `` did n't clearly show up the nature of the ad,'' she said In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed Ms. <PERSON> Blandford </PERSON>'s account of what happened. `` The fax had failed us,'' he said. He said once the `` embarrassing'' mistake was discovered, the company rushed to put an apology in print, and had in fact delayed the press run so that it might run in the next issue.

<TEXT>
 Syrian shells exploded sporadically around Christian ports Wednesday, and newspapers reported beleaguered Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is willing to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediators. An-Nahar, an independent daily, also quoted a right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia spokesman as threatening to seek non-Arab help if the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> fails to convince <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw its 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by November. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> residents, wearied by the continued shelling and lacking clear directives from the league, are wondering whether they should relax or brace for another devastating confrontation. `` This is no war and no peace. Are they going to fight a full-scale war again? No one has an answer,'' said <PERSON> Bahjat </PERSON> <PERSON> Daowe </PERSON>, a bank clerk in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Like many others, I do n't know what to do. Shall I bring my family back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> or not? I really do n't know.'' About 750,000 Christians and Moslems evacuated the capital and surrounding mountains during two months of shelling duels that started March 8 and killed at least 360 people. The uncertainty is reflected in a statement of the syndicate of non-government schools, which said it is `` considering reopening schools soon.'' It set no date to reopen the schools closed March 14. Syrian gunners kept shelling <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos ports north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, violating a cease-fire called by heads of state from the 22-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Police said 20 howitzer shells exploded around the ports before dawn. No casualties were reported. The barrage is a daily routine by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> gunners tying to prevent boats delivering ammunition to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. A police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners did not return the Syrian fire. <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is `` fully prepared'' to cooperate with a three-member committee named by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> last week after its summit failed to compromise on a Lebanese peace formula. The committee _ King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s King Fahd and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> _ has six months to produce a settlement to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has welcomed the Arab effort, but <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia as saying the summit's outcome was `` a big disappointment for us because it did not call openly for a Syrian pullout.'' <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders reportedly want a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> withdrawal, but <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to compromise. The Christian militia supports <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' to drive the 40,000 Syrian troops out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An-Nahar quoted the militia spokesman as threatening to seek non-Arab help to force a withdrawal if the committee fails. An-Nahar and the leftist daily <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> reported that foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. <PERSON> As-Safir </PERSON> said they discussed establishing a security committee to supervise implementation of the cease-fire and monitor ports. The present violence broke out after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias that deflect about $ 100 million in customs duties from government coffers. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s militia reacted by shelling the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> enclave with Syrian help.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner: Some Bodies Show `Subtle' Strangulation Signs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A re-examination of the bodies of 19 young women found dead under similar circumstances since 1986 revealed subtle evidence suggesting some victims were strangled or suffocated, the medical examiner said Wednesday. Most of the victims were cocaine addicts with a history of prostitution. All but one were black. Their remains were found in fields and alleys in a narrow area of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, usually in positions indicating recent sexual activity. Police have looked at theories ranging from a serial killer to a previously unknown toxic cocaine reaction to explain the deaths. Few of the victims showed signs of injury. Many of the remains were too badly decomposed to re-examine thoroughly, but seven bodies showed `` scanty or subtle evidence not inconsistent with carefully applied neck pressure,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in a report. `` It is my considered opinion that the repetitive pattern of body position, location and scene circumstances constitute a reasonable conclusion as to manner of death _ homicide,'' he concluded. The medical examiner said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Souviron </PERSON> _ a specialist in forensic odontology who helped convict serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> by matching bite marks on his victims _ found `` minute changes to indicate mild or moderate pressure to the mouth.'' Debilitated by drug use, the victims could quickly lose consciousness without putting up much of a struggle, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s Police detective division, said police have the treated the deaths all along as potential murders. `` There's a lot of this we do n't understand and we do n't have the answers,'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is saying, ` It's my feeling this is homicide, and I'm the boss.''' The detective cautioned that the medical examiner, while suggesting the women were murdered, `` is not saying that absolutely.'' He said police were still looking at the theory that a toxic cocaine reaction, perhaps in conjunction with sex, caused the deaths. Investigators have also questioned a rapist, now in jail, with a history of choking his victims into unconsciousness. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> emphasized that the deaths were all associated with `` people in crack-house environments'' and said that whatever the cause, there seemed to be little or no risk to the public.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Suggests Nov. 13 as Possible Trial Date</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Iran-Contra trial of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> might not take place until November or later, lawyers and a federal judge said Wednesday. At a hearing, prosecutor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> suggested Nov. 13 as `` a possible trial date, with the court's permission.'' Chief U.S. District Court Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> cautioned that such a date is `` predicated on no major ... problems'' pertaining to the use at trial of material that is now classified by the government. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, said `` there is some potential for complications'' because the government may be reluctant to declassify some of the material for use in the courtroom. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, enlisted by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras, is accused in two indictments of conspiring, offering and paying illegal gratuities to <PERSON> North </PERSON> and of covering up <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s alleged profits from the Iran-Contra affair. The government wants to consolidate the cases, but <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> says the nine cover-up charges, brought April 7, should be dismissed. They represent `` prosecutorial vindictiveness,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said in court papers. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to combine them, saying `` proof of the two sets of charges will entirely overlap.'' The gratuities counts were brought on March 16, 1988, as part of a larger indictment accusing <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of conspiring with <PERSON> North </PERSON> to defraud the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by diverting money to the Contras from secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Also charged with conspiracy and theft were former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> business partner <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. Due to national security concerns, the prosecution is expected to abandon the conspiracy and theft counts against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. Presenting evidence of such charges would entail a significant amount of now-classified material and for this reason identical conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed in January against North. `` Hoping to save what is left of the 1988 indictment,'' the government seeks to combine the `` weak, remaining counts'' with the new indictment in an `` unfair attempt to create an aura of wrongdoing about General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>,'' he said in court papers.

 On a riverboat that charges tourists $ 17 a ride, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> cruised down the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Wednesday past hillside vineyards and ancient castles silhouetted atop rugged ridgelines. Of course, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not get the standard tour. And for him, it was free. The three-deck <PERSON> Stolzenfels </PERSON>, occasionally used for state dinners, was redecorated with Persian carpets on indoor decks. It was staffed with white-gloved waiters carrying trays of champagne, wine and beer and hovering over an elaborate buffet. With brilliant blue skies, warm weather and friendly crowds waving from the shores, the trip was a picture-perfect windup to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 27-hour visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The president called it `` an unforgettable day on the Rhine.'' To make sure the excursion received maximum television and photo coverage, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chartered a second riverboat for cameramen and photographers who followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boat. The photo boat, with a capacity of 1,000 or more, carried only a handful of people. About 300 guests were invited on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boat from political circles, the arts, social and industrial fields. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the trip by receiving a case of local wines from <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, a queen of the wine-growing region. He rewarded her with a kiss on the cheek. At the urging of photographers, and as his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> watched on, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kissed the young lady again. And for good measure, he kissed her a third time. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised her eyes in mock dismay. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been ebullient in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, where he won endorsement for his conventional-arms proposal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and helped defuse an alliance dispute over short-range nuclear missiles. The two-hour river trip began at <LOCATION> Oberwesel </LOCATION>, a town which still retains a medieval appearance and is dominated by the sight of the 1,000-year-old Schonburg Castle. It concluded at <LOCATION> Koblenz </LOCATION>, an ancient city where the <LOCATION> Moselle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> flows into the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>. As the <PERSON> Stolzenfels </PERSON> plied the river, a male choir serenaded the Bushes with the legend of the <LOCATION> Loreley </LOCATION>, the `` wondrous maiden'' whose siren song lured sailors to shipwreck and death. The waterway path through the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>'s deeply-cut valley is one of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most popular tourist attractions, followed by millions each year. The path is lined with picturesque castles and carefully tended vineyards clinging to the hillsides. Tourists pay about $ 17 for a trip as long as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, but they do n't get the same VIP attention. A cannon salute marked the beginning and end of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ride. Two helicopters hovered high overhead throughout the trip and four police boats doggedly trailed the ship. On both shores, a caravan of police cars and troop vehicles drove slowly to keep pace with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boat. At town after town, crowds of people turned out to wave to the president. Concluding the trip at <LOCATION> Koblenz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to the Deutsches Eck, a world famous `` memorial of German unity'' where he signed the town book. He said he hoped this week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit would be viewed in the future as one of `` historic consequence.'' From <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and a luncheon Thursday with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Chinese-American professionals are joining with Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an effort to raise money and channel it to protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by way of the black market and other backdoor routes. A full-page ad bearing some 500 names, most of them professors and other intellectuals, appeared in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, appealing for donations for the Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. An organizer, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Ying-Shih </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, said the money will go toward such things as setting up a network of computers, fax machines and copiers and helping the student protesters put out their own newspapers. `` I think they need all kinds of money for good causes, for pushing the movement further,'' <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He said more than 1,000 people, mostly intellectuals and businessmen, have joined the fund drive that took out the $ 45,000 ad. `` This is mostly by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, ethnic Chinese most of them,'' he said. The professor said the campaign, organized at <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, expects to raise about $ 200,000 and send it to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in cash and checks with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students and scholars returning to their homeland from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The money will go directly to the students to take advantage of the black market exchange rate, which is nearly three times the official rate, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said. Otherwise, the government will `` rob the money out of the students' pockets.'' `` The black market is not really so black. Everyone uses it. It's kind of an open secret,'' he said. Students in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and other cities also have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the students and others who have occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central Tiananmen Square for nearly three weeks to press their demands for democracy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is host to an estimated 40,000 students from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said he knows of no one who has run afoul of the law in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for taking money in for protesters. `` Most people have relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that send them money from time to time, and they take it to the streets,'' he said. Other methods will include electronic transfers between companies doing business in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and transactions carried out in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> storefronts, said <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, a professor of history and East Asian studies. `` In the states I have guessed we have raised $ 150,000 from overseas Chinese students,'' said activist <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> <PERSON> Minxin </PERSON>, a third-year graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, several universities pooled their resources together and we collected something like $ 37,000. Of that amount about $ 11,000 has already channeled back in the form of cash and equipment.'' The rest will be sent when there is confirmation that the money has been spent properly, he said Wednesday. `` Let's just say the money is being brought in, wired in, transferred in _ all the ways business gets money into the country is being copied by us,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` The government would have to shut down all the international transactions in order to stop money from being sent in. And that's impossible for them.'' He said money is being taken in by tourists and other `` good-hearted people,'' none of whom are given large sums so as not to arouse suspicion with bulging wallets. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> also said he knows of no one who has run afoul of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. `` They've got to catch people delivering money and even that is very hard, because we can say he's paying off a debt, it's just a relative's money,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. Storefront transactions are routinely used by Chinese to send gifts home, said <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest Chinese language newspaper. For example, a person leaves $ 100 with a storefront operator, who then has a contact in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> deliver the equivalent in Chinese money out of his own pocket to the intended recipient, the reporter said. In return, the contact has $ 100 on deposit outside the country. `` It's illegal activity, but it's not secret in the Chinese community,'' said <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Too many people are doing this kind of business. You just ca n't stop it anymore.'' <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said supporters of the students are also taking advantage of U.S.-Chinese business links by putting down money for, say, a fax machine, at an electronics company in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; the merchandise is picked up at a connected store in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 A new plan to integrate higher education in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> without closing or merging any colleges puts much of the burden of success or failure on a single governing board, officials said Wednesday. Replacing four boards with a single, powerful one was pushed by Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> over the objections of some black leaders who felt it would be insensitive to needs of students at the state's two mostly black universities On Tuesday, a special master appointed by three federal judges to find a way to settle a 15-year-old lawsuit against <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> submitted his final desegregation proposal for court approval. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, called for giving the governor power to appoint a 17-member governing board, subject to state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> said the board should include at least seven blacks, show a geographic balance, represent all schools and include a student. Unlike the state's current <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, the board would not share power with boards that oversee the mostly black Southern University System, the mostly white <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, and the smaller, regional schools. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crain </PERSON>, president of the board overseeing regional colleges, said it will be up to the unified governing board to implement <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>'s plan successfully. `` It all depends on how the new board approaches this. If they follow what's been laid out here it can happen. The state is going to have to take this very seriously to bring about integration,'' <PERSON> Crain </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> lawyer who represents <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, one of the two mostly black universities, said he had not received a copy of the plan. `` I do know the single board has nothing to do with desegregation, and it seems to be the centerpiece of this plan,'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, attorney for the other predominantly <PERSON> black </PERSON> college, <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said he could not comment on the plan until he received a copy. The plan would provide additional money to the mostly black universities to develop programs more attractive to white students. It also would establish admission standards to funnel better-prepared students into selective universities and others into a new community college system. Currently, any graduate of a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> high school can attend any state college. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Andonie </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, said these changes could advance desegregation somewhat, but `` until they have some significant merging of some schools, there's not going to be much integration.'' The schools that need integrating have to be good and the costs reasonable to attract students, he said. `` If they're not happy, they're simply not going to go to the schools involved,'' <PERSON> Andonie </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think this is a cosmetic plan,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said. `` I think you will look on the landscape of higher education in five years and it will not be the same. The changes will be fundamental _ quality and desegregation.''

<HEAD>Cancel Tax-Funded Caribbean Cruise for Offenders After Outcry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughoput with cruise canceled.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local politicians, apparently reacting to public uproar, decided Wednesday not to send a group of teen-age offenders on a six-month rehabilitation cruise to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> at taxpayer expense. The social board in the suburb of <LOCATION> Kista </LOCATION> dropped plans to participate in the cruise after it received a bomb threat. Social commissioner <PERSON> Ragnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotestam </PERSON> later announced on TV that the project had to be canceled because at least two community social boards had changed their mind about the $ 80,000 cruise on a 53-foot sailing craft to Saint <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands. He said he hoped to pursue the project later. Eight teen-agers convicted of crimes such as assault, theft, burglary and property damage were candidates for the training cruise. At least three social workers would have accompanied them. The program also called for instruction in citizenship, and authorites had given assurances there would be no chance to escape. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s liberal penal system accents rehabilitation rather than punishment, but it has come under increasing criticism recently as too lenient. The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> added its voice to those critics of the cruise. `` How could the district social board in unison make a decision so distant from reason and judgment and with such total lack of contact with the way ordinary people think?'' it asked in an editorial. Authorities argued the offenders were influenced by their family background and rough neighborhoods, and that getting away would be more helpful than harsh punishment. None of the eight is serving prison sentences, although they must report regularly to the authorities. Their behavior was deemed so bad that no halfway houses would accept them. `` These children need love and security,'' said Stockholm Social Director <PERSON> Ulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, defending the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> trip for the youths, who under press regulations have not been identified. `` This is not a vacation, but a working trip,'' said <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Roxe </PERSON>, who would have escorted them. He told Swedish Radio that 400 convicts had gone through the training program in Swedish waters and 200 are employed as officers at sea. `` People should be happy to get rid of them, and maybe to see these people being reintegrated into a working life as new men after six months,'' he said. Among the opponents of the cruise program are <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Eriksson </PERSON> and Youth Minister <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallstrom </PERSON>. They ridiculed the idea of sending the youths to an area where drugs abound. Last year, a similar public furor forced authorities to scrap plans to send a convicted criminal on a trip to the Egyptian pyramids. The authorities had said it would help the convict, who was about to be released, to readjust to society. Swedish prisons have a generous furlough program. After completing one-third of their sentence, prisoners are eligible for up to six 48-hour passes a year. The prison service reported 287 violations out of 8,951 furloughs granted in 1987. Prisons also have frequent conjugal visits for most inmates. The system came under scathing attack when <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s most notorious spy, <PERSON> Stig </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergling </PERSON>, slipped away while on furlough in 1987 and apparently escaped with his wife to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In another experiment, long-term prisoners can spend two-week vacations relaxing with their families in an unguarded holiday village in central <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, with skiing in winter, hiking in the woods, or swimming in summer.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, beset by investigations of alleged ethics violations, has decided to resign his leadership post and planned to make an announcement to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> today, sources said. `` He told me himself,'' said one House member, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The lawmaker and other sources who said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would resign as speaker did not say whether he also would give up his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. Spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would say only that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> planned to deliver his speech in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber, and the speech would last more than half an hour. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> worked alone in his office on the statement throughout the afternoon, up until minutes before he was to deliver it. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation has been expected since last week, when his lawyers entered into several hours of negotiations with the ethics committee in an attempt to win dismissal of some of the alleged violations in exchange for the speaker's stepping down. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself has consistently denied knowingly violating ethics rules, but his political support among Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eroded steadily as the ethics committee methodically investigated his finances. One of the speaker's staunch defenders said Tuesday the pressure on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to quit appeared overwhelming. `` I believe it's probably too late to change things in his favor,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Although `` justice would be served by following the game to the end,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, he expected his friend to step down. The heat continued as <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified sources, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section was launching a `` preliminary criminal investigation'' of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have previously said the department was monitoring ethics proceedings against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> but had not decided on a probe of its own. Sources also told those two news organizations and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is looking into allegations of payroll padding on the staff of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, currently vying to move up in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, said after <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broke the story Tuesday that it was an `` outrageous lie.'' He said he was questioned by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents Monday but assured he was not the subject of an investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the report. Not waiting for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s final decision, some of his own lieutenants were scrambling to move up in the ranks. The pressure on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the power game were made all the more intense by the announcement last weekend that Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic whip, would be resigning. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s resignation followed reports he earned nearly $ 7,000 from a junk bond investment for which he never had to put up any of his own money. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was charged last month by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> with violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in 69 instances. The most serious of those involve allegedly accepting improper gifts _ including a no-work job for his wife _ from a developer friend, and circumventing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income through bulk sales of his book `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The speaker has repeatedly insisted that he broke no House rules or any laws, and he has vowed to fight for the honor of his wife, who he contends earned her pay. The ethics committee was scheduled to meet Thursday to consider <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss those charges. `` I'm convinced our motions are legally well grounded,'' he said Tuesday. Another factor adding pressure on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was a continuing ethics committee probe into areas not covered by its original set of charges. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the committee, said in answer to a question Tuesday that it might expand its investigation into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s investment in a gas well drilling venture and a deal involving a nursing home company. `` It's possible we could vote for a preliminary inquiry on those two issues,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, is in line to succeed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has no known opposition for the speakership. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., appeared to be the front runner to replace <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., if he moved Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., was competing against <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> The race to succeed <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> as Majority Whip was more wide open. Candidates included <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the Chief Deputy Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., a powerful member of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also was weighing his support

 Orders to factories for manufactured goods rose in April for the second straight month in the biggest increase since December, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The strong 2.7 percent April gain followed a 0.7 percent hike in March and 1.2 percent and 2 percent declines in January and February. Orders had soared 4.7 percent in December. Total orders registered $ 239.4 billion on a seasonably adjusted basis in April. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared the factory orders report with the <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> which <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> also released on Wednesday Factory orders were `` absolutely surprising,'' he said, while the indicators showed a slower 0.8 percent increase after falling for two months. `` It means,'' he said, `` the porridge is not too hot, not too cold and it is n't just right. We're just vacillating between the two, I think.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the orders report `` means that in April the economy picked up from a depressed level in March. `` And yet ... orders were not higher in April than in December.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` So although the industrial sector of the economy is still advancing, it does n't have anywhere the kind of momentum it had in 1988.'' Commerce said both durable and nondurable orders rose in April, with durables up 3 percent to $ 129.2 billion. It said all major industries expect fabricated metals participated in the increase. Electrical machinery orders were up 9.3 percent to $ 20 billion; primary metals such as steel up 6 percent to $ 12.6 billion and transportation equipment up 1.4 percent to $ 37.6 billion. The highly volatile transportation segment was up 11 percent in March and down 7.6 percent in February. Orders for non-durable goods jumped 2.4 percent to $ 110.2 billion, the department reported. Nearly half the increase was in the petroleum refining industry. The overall increase would have been higher except for a 15.8 percent drop in defense orders which are subject to wide swings depending on when big contracts are signed. Excluding defense, orders rose 3.6 percent after falling 0.3 percent in March and 2.7 percent in February.

<HEAD>North Says Judge Should Set Aside His Convictions</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> says a judge should set aside his convictions in the Iran-Contra affair because the prosecution made critical errors, including failure to show any principal figure `` intended to violate the law.'' In court papers filed late Tuesday, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the government neglected to show that anyone intended to obstruct <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> North </PERSON>, in November 1986, assisted in assembling a false chronology of an arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North was convicted of aiding and abetting the obstruction, but `` a fundamental requirement of any conviction for aiding and abetting is that the jury first find a guilty principal,'' the court papers said. The government `` did not demonstrate that any principal intended to violate the law and to obstruct <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said in their filing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is charged with obstruction and making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the chronology. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is expected to go on trial later this year. The false chronology said no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 that a November 1985 shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contained arms. Evidence presented at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial showed he and more than a dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials received intelligence in 1985 detailing the shipment's contents. North also was convicted of altering and destroying official documents he wrote to national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> detailing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. North is scheduled for sentencing June 23. In the court papers, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he should be acquitted because testimony at the trial showed he was n't the custodian of the documents. North also was convicted of accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from Iran-Contra co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who lives outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said the charge should have been brought in courts there, rather than in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. If the court refuses to acquit <PERSON> North </PERSON>, he should be granted a new trial on the three charges for which he was convicted, he said. The former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had given improper instructions to the jury. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers, placed too many restrictions on North's defense, which was based on the assertion that all of the actions for which he was charged with crimes were authorized by his superiors. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s instructions `` unconstitutionally limited the jury's consideration'' of evidence in the case, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> On Wednesday, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> opposed a prosecution motion to consolidate two sets of criminal charges against him in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was indicted on March 16, 1988. Among the charges were conspiring, offering and paying illegal gratuities to North. Enlisted by <PERSON> North </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also was indicted April 7 for covering up from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his alleged profits from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Contra initiatives. The government wants to combine charges from the two indictments, but <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said in court papers that the latest indictment reflects `` prosecutorial vindictiveness'' and fails to state a criminal offense. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is seeking to dismiss the new charges.

 Sales of semiautomatic weapons boomed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as the June 1 deadline for the state's mandatory permit application drew near, and gun dealers said the meaner-looking the gun the better the sales. Customers bought `` anything that looks ugly, that looks like an assault weapon ... anything that may look military,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucchiara </PERSON>, president of Trader Sports in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leandro </LOCATION>, the state's largest retail gun dealer Buyers of the weapons included collectors, investors, `` yuppies,'' and others who hoped to escape the more restrictive buying process going into effect Thursday. Most of <PERSON> Cucchiara </PERSON>'s customers were older men, and many shoppers were `` buying the more expensive guns and buying more than one, putting them away for investment purposes.'' `` There are people buying these things as souvenirs, too,'' he said Tuesday. `` Little old men and little old women are walking into the store, saying they want to buy an AK-47.'' People who bought an assault weapon before Thursday merely had to get it registered. But beginning June 1, the sale of more than 50 kinds of semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns is virtually banned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by a new law that includes a restrictive permit process. The legislation, and the heightened interest in semiautomatic weapons, was prompted by a January incident in which a man with an AK-47, a Soviet-designed assault weapon, attacked a elementary school playground in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, killing five students and himself. Between June 1 and Jan. 1, buyers must submit an application for a state permit _ similar to one required of movie studios for machine guns _ that is `` very restrictive,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, an aide to state Assemblyman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>. Possession of a permit is required as of Jan. 1, when the law banning sales of more than 50 specified semiautomatic rifles, shotguns and handguns goes into effect. People who buy those guns between June 1 and Jan. 1 but are denied permits must sell their guns to a dealer, a permit holder or someone living outside the state, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. Violators will be subject to a maximum four-year prison term. A man who gave his name only as <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> at B & amp; B Sales in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> said most weapons on the restricted list have already `` dried up.'' Many gun dealers said they expected the last-minute surge of interest in the weapons and compared the demand to bread and gasoline shortages. `` The public reacts very uniformly,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellithorpe </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` They run on anything they ca n't get their hands on. That's not unusual. That's a public nature item.'' Shop owners said prices also were skyrocketing. <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said that when the boom was starting, he got two AR-15s, the civilian version of the military's M-16, from a supplier for about $ 569 each. `` I called them back about three weeks later and asked them if they had any more. They said they still had several AR-15s in stock and wanted $ 1,975 wholesale,'' he said. Sales have been brisk ever since Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he would sign the legislation, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, manager at <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ammo Supply in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION>. `` People are feeling a little more rushed. Now we're selling about 60 to 70 a week. We've been selling 10 guns a day for the last week.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Fremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION>, a manager named <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> who declined to give his last name, said cost distinguishes the gun collector from others. `` Anyone who goes out and pays $ 3,000 for a SIG assault rifle is not going to shoot it. It's like a fine work of art, like buying a piece of sculpture.'' Just north in <LOCATION> Castro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, Combat Arms owner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bash </PERSON> said his customers have been white-collar professionals ranging from attorneys to police officers. `` What I'm seeing is the professional people buying while the buying's still good,'' he said. `` One wholesaler brought in 700 -LRB- AK-47s -RRB- in one day and sold all of them,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Alger </PERSON>, store gun buyer for Big R Country West Guns in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Bash declined to give numbers on sales, but said he's selling three times the usual number of semi-automatic weapons. <PERSON> Cucchiara </PERSON> of Trader Sports said his shop used to sell two or three semi-automatics each day, and is selling 30 to 40-a-day now. At H & amp; H Enterprises in <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a telephone recording told Memorial Day weekend callers that the answering machine was on because business was so good that no one had time to come to the phone.

 About 2,000 American servicemen and their families gave President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an enthusiastic sendoff from Rhein Main Air Base on Wednesday, expressing hope that his disarmament initiatives succeed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew by helicopter to the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base just six miles south of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on the last stop of his West German visit before leaving for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The crowd gathered on the tarmac at the airbase cheered, applauded and waved small <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags when the president arrived. First Sgt. <PERSON> Marcelles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneed </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said he had followed news of the president's trip closely. `` It's been impressive the stand he has taken with -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sneed </PERSON> said. `` He's met the challenge. I hope it works, but I do n't know if I trust the Russians.'' Master Sgt. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, commenting on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said: `` I think a lot of people back home will be happy about that.'' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, waited for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival with her son <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, 12, and 9-year-old daughter Amber Mrs. <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, who said she has been in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for three years with her husband, Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, said she was enthusiastic about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s European trip. `` I have high hopes for what he's doing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said.

 Motorists who parked on a one-way street and later found that the street direction had been changed _ and that they had been ticketed for parking the wrong way _ can get their tickets thrown out.

 <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> received the formal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request Wednesday for extradition of <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, the jailed Saudi financier and arms dealer accused of helping <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> plunder the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The American request, accompanied by 243 pages of evidence, arrived six weeks after police arrested <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, 54, while he was having breakfast at a luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had asked that he be detained. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said the Swiss federal police were studying the extradition request. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON> said it was too early to tell when a decision would be made. Lawyers for <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> said a few days after his arrest April 18 that they would do everything possible to prevent extradition, but have not taken legal steps to challenge his detention. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zloczower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s Swiss lawyer, was not available Wednesday night. A secretary at his <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> office said he would have no comment. If <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> decides the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges have legal foundation, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> will be granted a hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. An extradition order can be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s supreme court. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, the Marcoses, five other people and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bank were indicted in October by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The indictment accuses the ousted president and his wife of stealing more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real estate and expensive art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> posed as owner of some of the assets as a cover, according to prosecutors. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> is charged in the indictment with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud. Racketeering alone carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> destroyed a combined 1,269 nuclear missiles during the first year of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Wednesday. The two sides also have conducted a combined 340 inspections to verify the missile destruction and ensure compliance with other terms of the treaty. `` The past year has been marked by almost continual elimination of missiles, launchers and related equipment as both sides seek to implement the primary aim of the INF Treaty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said in a statement. `` Since the first Soviet SS-20 missile destruction at <LOCATION> Kapustin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yar </LOCATION> in August, -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- inspectors have witnessed the elimination of 945 Soviet missiles. Beginning with the Sept. 8 elimination at <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Soviet inspectors have been present for the destruction of 324 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> INF missiles.'' The treaty took effect on June 1, 1988, and calls for the destruction of all intermediate-range nuclear missiles over a three-year period. Those missiles have a range of roughly 300 miles to 3,500 miles, and the agreement to destroy them marked the first time the two superpowers had agreed to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. The agreement also marked the first time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ever agreed to on-site, or `` intrusive,'' inspections to ensure compliance with an arms treaty. When the treaty took effect, the Soviets had 1,846 missiles in the intermediate-range category, divided among six different types. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had 846 missiles, divided between <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> and ground-launched cruise missiles. According to the yearend statistics, which were compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, both sides exercised their right to conduct 20 surprise inspections during the first year, in addition to the normal inspections to witness destruction of missiles and to verify the final closure of INF missile facilities. The Soviets conducted 96 inspections during the year in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared to 244 conducted by American inspectors at Soviet sites. Both sides also succeeded during the first year in moving an inspection team from the other country into permanent housing facilities near missile plants. The treaty specifies that up to 30 inspectors may be located full-time outside the gates of a missile production plant to guard against surreptious production of INF missiles. In the case of the Soviets, they were provided housing facilities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, on April 17, near a Hercules plant at <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. American inspectors moved into permanent housing in <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, near a missile plant, on April 10.

<TEXT>
 Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders failed in nine months of talks to agree on reunifying the divided island before a Thursday deadline, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> granted a three-week extension. Officials said it was likely the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would be called in to mediate the deadlocked negotiations. Leaders of both communities are trying to establish a formula for a two-state federation under which the Greek Cypriot majority of 550,000 people would share power with the 120,000-member Turkish Cypriot minority. The Greek side reportedly is pushing for a strong federal government, while the Turkish side wants a looser federation. The two sides reportedly also disagree over the withdrawal of Turkish troops, and the right of 200,000 Greek Cypriots to return to property they fled after the 1974 Turkish invasion. Turkish Cypriot leader, <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, president of the breakaway state in north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> that is recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, said he would intensify efforts for international recognition if the talks break off. `` The talks prevented our recognition by friends. Once they are broken off, there will be no obstacles to our recognition,'' <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said. Greek Cypriot leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, president of the internationally recognized government of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, blamed Turkish intransigence for the lack of progress. `` We have submitted comprehensive proposals for the solution of all aspects of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` World opinion agrees that our proposals are honorable, reasonable and can lead to an agreement.'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said he favors mediation by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> does not. In 1974, a coup by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s military junta failed on the island. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded the northern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, saying it was protecting the minority Turkish Cypriot community and partitioned the east Mediterranean island. In the wake of the invasion, 40,000 Turkish Cypriots also moved north, taking over the homes and properties of the Greek Cypriot refugees. Other property was given to an estimated 50,000 settlers brought to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from the Turkish mainland. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> in 1975 proclaimed the northern part of the island an independent Turkish state. The two sides are divided by a heavily fortified `` Green Line'' manned by 13,000 Greek Cypriot troops facing an estimated 30,000 Turkish army soldiers and 10,000 Turkish Cypriot soldiers. The buffer zone extending 112 miles across the island is patrolled by a 2,100-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force. The two Cypriot leaders agreed on the Thursday deadline when they embarked on their negotiations during a meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in August.

 A woman who said masked gunmen abducted her two baby girls nearly three years apart was indicted Wednesday on charges of concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in the 1986 death of one daughter. The grand jury indictment charged <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> with concealing a homicide and three counts of obstructing justice in the death of 13-day-old <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. Investigators have said the disappearance and death in late April of the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' second daughter, 6-week-old <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>, renewed interest in the earlier case. No charges have been filed in <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s death, which came after Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, moved to neighboring <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where an investigation is under way. <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringhausen </PERSON> brought the charges against <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION>'s death earlier this month, then presented evidence and witnesses to the grand jury. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Groshong </PERSON>, attorney for the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON>, would not comment on the indictment. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> remains free on a $ 10,000 cash bond and no court date has been set. By asking a grand jury, rather than a judge in open court, to bring the case to trial, <PERSON> Ringhausen </PERSON> was able to keep secret information from the pending <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigation, he said. In 1987, the couple claimed Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and refused to testify before a <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury that conducted an earlier investigation into <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s death That grand jury returned no indictments and the case remained open. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 37, told police last month he suspected his 29-year-old wife may have killed both babies accidentally, investigators have said. In each case, Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said a masked gunman took her baby girl while her husband was at work. <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON> was reported abducted in June 1986. Her body was discovered a week later in a wooded area about 150 yards from the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON>' home. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> was reported abducted on April 29. Her body was discovered four days later in a trash can in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>. A third <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> child, a 16-month-old boy, has been in the custody of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> since shortly after <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s disappearance.

 Most Israelis favor affirmative action for women, tax breaks for child care, and a longer school day to allow more mothers to work full time, according to preliminary results of a survey conducted Wednesday. The informal survey, described by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> as the most extensive done in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was organized by <ORGANIZATION> Naamat </ORGANIZATION>, the women's organization of the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> The goal was to demonstrate to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s government and the public that there is strong support for <ORGANIZATION> Naamat </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign for greater economic rights for While the level of education of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> women is comparable to that in other developed countries, the women's movement has not won the same support here as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ethia </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON>, the prime minister's adviser on the status of women, noted that 51 percent of all government workers are women, but only 11 percent hold management jobs. Only 2 percent of all government-run companies are headed by women, Ms. <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON> said. `` There is not enough consciousness about women's rights in this country,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Naamat </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carmel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>. `` One of the aims of the poll is to raise public debate on these questions.'' Ms. <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON> said more than 500,000 surveys were turned in, about one-third of them by men. She said according to results based on about half the survey responses: _ Ninety percent support extending the school day past 2 p.m. so more mothers may work full time. _ Seventy-four percent approve of tax breaks for child care. _ Seventy-five percent support changes in the tax law that would allow women to file separate returns. _ Only about two-thirds of the respondents support affirmative actions programs for women. `` Most people against were men,'' she added. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> women and men lined up at about 2,000 sites set up in banks, day care centers, supermarkets and on sidewalks across the country to take part in the survey. At a busy intersection near a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> shopping center, organizers set up a cardboard box on the pavement. In a 15-minute period, about 40 people dropped off questionnaires. `` I'm really surprised by the number of people voting. I do n't know what I'll do when our box is full,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Naamat </ORGANIZATION> volunteer Ms. <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON> said she hoped that several hundred thousand Israelis over 18 would participate in the survey. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a population of 4.2 million.

 An 8-month-old boy who was shot in the head by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers lay unconscious in a hospital Wednesday, suffering from severe brain damage and breathing through a respirator. The shooting highlighted the dispute between Palestinians who say troops fire at demonstrators without regard for innocents, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials who say women and children are put in the front lines to serve as shields and win publicity for the Palestinian uprising. The army confirmed that the infant, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>, was shot by troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> on Tuesday. It said the incident was under investigation. Arab reporters said clashes occurred at the camp on Tuesday night following a march, and that several people were wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted Palestinian sources as saying <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was struck when his mother, <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>, participated in the march with the boy in her arms. Mrs. <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> said she was carrying the child down an alley when he was hit by a stray bullet. She said she did not see any clashes at the time. `` I felt blood on his head. The soldiers were about 100 yards away at the end of the street. I shouted ` He was hit, he was hit,' and then I ran away,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>, 23, was slumped on a bed outside her son's room at <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Inside, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> lay unconscious, the left side of his head covered by a bandage and the right side of his body paralyzed. He kicked with his left foot as a nurse cleared his nasal passage. `` He suffered severe brain damage. We removed a large portion of contused brain tissue. If he survives, he will have all kinds of disabilities,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Wahib </PERSON> <PERSON> Dajani </PERSON>, chief anesthesiologist in the intensive care unit. He displayed the tip of a plastic bullet that pierced the child's brain and was removed from his skull. <PERSON> Dajani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was the youngest victim of the Palestinian uprising to be treated at the hospital. He said the average age of shooting victims has decreased in recent months, and that more and more children and teen-agers were among the wounded. The shooting of Mohammed renewed the debate over the army's firing practices during the nearly 18-month-old rebellion against the Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> The uprising has claimed 502 Palestinian lives. Twenty-two Israelis also have been killed. The Palestinian-run <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said 34 Arab children under 5 have been killed by troops during the uprising, including 29 who died from tear gas inhalation and three who were shot to death. Palestinians and human rights activists argue that troops fire wildly to break up protests, often hitting bystanders that include young children. The wounding of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> `` undoubtedly resulted from the army's indiscriminate shooting,'' said <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a Palestinian lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> A senior army official blamed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activists for making `` cynical use of children'' in demonstrations. `` By getting children killed, you get more publicity and that keeps the uprising alive, which is what the inciters want. What better way is there than to get a child killed every day?'' said Col. <PERSON> Ranaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman. He said young children were `` used as shields'' also to protect adult activists, especially when plastic bullets are fired at the knees of demonstrators. `` The responsibility for the children being there is that of the parents and the activists,'' he said. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said that in some cases women and children were wounded while walking near the scenes of clashes, but that the number of such cases was `` minuscule when compared to the pattern of using children on purpose.'' <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a leading Palestinian intellectual and politican in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, rejected the claim that children were used as shields. `` There is no way someone is sending children to protect himself. It is just propaganda coming from people who think they have more human feelings than we do,'' he said. Under army regulations, soldiers are barred from firing plastic bullets at children under age 16. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a liberal member of parliament, said that while Palestinians had used children as propaganda instruments, the army in many instances had disregarded standing orders on opening fire. `` This is the tragedy, that the children have to pay for the blindness and stupidity of their elders,'' he said.

 Leftist rebels paralyzed public transportation Wednesday and said they would make this Central American nation ungovernable on the eve of the inauguration of a rightist president. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, takes office Thursday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s first transfer of power from one elected president to another. But <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels called on the nation's 5.5 million citizens to boycott public transportation for an indefinite period starting Wednesday. There was no urban or inter-city bus service on the ban's first day, dispatchers said. Troops in the capital seized a large cache of weapons blonging to the rebels who have waged a nine-year civil war against the government, police said in a communique. The seizure netted more than 350 Soviet-made rifles, 300 sticks of dynamite and more than 1.5 million bullets, police said. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, 41, a businessman and coffee grower, was elected on March 19 in an election with the lowest voter turnout in a decade. The low turnout was partly attributed to a rebel transport boycott, and many said the rebel action cost the centrist candidate the election. The transport ban has been a favorite tactic of rebels, who threaten to shoot at or set fire to cars or buses found on the roads. Five traffic bans were enforced last year. Wednesday's boycott paralyzed all collective and cargo transporation nationwide. `` There is nothing. No buses have left and the terminal is empty,'' said a dispatcher in one of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s bus terminals. `` We are 100 percent paralyzed. The companies are stopped because nobody wants their equipment destroyed,'' the dispatcher said. Guerrillas have been bombing power lines and utility poles nightly. The military has mounted a security operation for the election that includes air and land surveillance patrols nationwide. According to the armed forces public information office, seven guerrillas have died and eight government soldiers have been injured in incidents around the country since Tuesday. The rebel radio station, Venceremos, said guerrillas killed eight soldiers and wounded 22, but did not list figures for its own fighters. Three Central American leaders are scheduled to be among 36 countries sending delegations to Thursday's inauguration. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents attending would be <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, who is dying of liver cancer, will be the first elected <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> president to hand power to another elected civilian. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s first task in his five-year term will be to convince the political opposition and international community that he is in charge. Arena opponents and even some party regulars say that <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is a front for business interests. They also express concern about his party's connection to right-wing death squads. Arena was founded in 1981 by a cashiered army major and alleged death-squad leader, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubisson </PERSON>, who still is considered the party's leader. The party has been linked to death squads which are blamed for up to half the 70,000 deaths in the civil war. D'Aubisson and <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> deny any connection to the death squads. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has decided to continue supporting the Salvadoran government unless death squad activity, which has lessened in recent years, resumes in full force. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pumps more than $ 1 million daily into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in economic and military aide.

 A private judge has been hired to consider a settlement offer in the palimony lawsuit filed by actress <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> against movie tough guy <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, a newspaper reported Wednesday.

Miss <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s companion for 13 years while legally married to another man, offered a settlement that included a <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home the couple shared; a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> house <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> was said to have bought for Miss <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> and her husband, sculptor <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; monthly payments of as much as $ 15,000 for the next seven years, and a $ 250,000 one-time payment. <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> rejected the offer, but it will likely be discussed in a hearing, the newspaper reported. Since the wait for trial in civil lawsuits filed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is routinely three to five years, many litigants are turning to private arbitration or to rent-a-judge firms.

<HEAD>IMF Chief Calls on Banks to Share Debt Reduction Burden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commercial banks must do more soon to help Third World countries reduce their debts, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in echoing comments of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Managing Director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, in some of his toughest comments on the subject, told a gathering of bankers in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that `` the time has come for the large internatinal banks to increase their contribution'' to the debt reduction program unveiled by Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10. `` It is urgent to set the strategy in motion without delay,'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The text of his remarks was released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan encourages banks to forgive a substantial portion of their loans to heavily indebted countries such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in return for guarantees that the rest will be repaid. Those guarantees are to be furnished by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and its sister international lending agency, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said that lengthy negotiations between commerical banks and the debtor countries over terms would jeopardize the whole strategy, given the perilous economic conditions facing many of the debtor countries. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>' remarks echoed statments made last week by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, who blamed the slow pace in getting the debt reduction effort under way on foot-dragging by the banks. If the banks fail to cooperate, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said, they could face the grim prospect that the debtor nations might decide to stop paying on their loans. An impasse between the banks and debtor nations could trigger a `` legislated or mandated solution to the problem that may be very much more unpleasant'' for the banks, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> warned. Commercial banks have complained that they ca n't accept major reductions in principal and interest payments because they are not being offered sufficient financial incentives to do so by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. But in his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said that the banks needed to give up the `` illusion'' that delay in reaching agreement on debt reduction proposals being made by the heavily indebted countries will force an increase in the amount the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and other public agencies are willing to contribute toward debt reduction. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> is `` not equipped to do more,'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said, adding that for the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> approach to succeed it would need equal efforts on the part of creditor and debtor countries, the commercial banks and the international lending organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. `` Each of the four partners must reconsider its methods and its contribution to the common goal,'' he said. `` We shall not succeed if any one of these parties chooses to skimp on its contribution or hopes to obtain from any of the other three a reduction of its fair share of the burden.'' Major commercial banks are preparing for a meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on June 7 where they hope to learn more details about what government incentives they can expect if they agree to write off a portion of the $ 1.2 trillion in Third World debt. The sessions will be attended by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 What may be one of the best jobs on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> was uncovered recently when <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sought a rate increase: Budget documents revealed the chairman's chauffeur is paid $ 60,000 a year. Not even <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s driver makes that much, and he's been with the real estate tycoon for 10 years, an aide said Wednesday. The chauffeur's salary is among the $ 185,000 that the utility spent last year to provide company officials with cars and chauffeurs. News of the expenditures comes as the company seeks an $ 85 million rate increase, or about $ 50 more per year from its customers. `` It's baffling how a company can cry poor and then take part in such wasteful spending and fancy perks,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriesberg </PERSON>, director of the Citizens for Safe Energy, which is fighting the increase. `` For them to ask families, some of whom are struggling to make ends meet, to fork over an extra $ 50 a year to keep people who are making $ 300,000 salaries in expensive cars and drivers is just inappropriate.'' The $ 60,177 income earned by the chauffeur for <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> is well above the salaries of most limousine drivers, according to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> limousine companies. `` For a regular driver? That does seem a little high,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mystic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Limousines </LOCATION>, where drivers are paid between $ 6 and $ 7 an hour and make the rest of their money in tips. `` That's absurd,'' said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s executive assistant, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerderer </PERSON>. `` If a driver made half that, it would be considered good. I'd be willing to be a driver.'' Even <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s chauffeur makes less than $ 30,000, she said. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> defended the expenditures as executive compensation and said they were in line with industry standards. `` And the fact is, this is the first rate increase for the company in five years,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, who earns $ 307,500 per year, is furnished with a $ 24,646 Cadillac as well as a driver, according to budget documents. <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Spataro </PERSON> said the $ 60,177 is both salary and overtime, but he would not give a breakdown. He would not identify the chauffeur.

<TEXT>
 The newly appointed premier Wednesday named three Cabinet ministers and fired four in a minor government shake-up, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said. The new 25-member Cabinet will be sworn in Thursday, officials said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> on Tuesday replaced 75-year-old <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hwa </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, who was premier for five years, was criticized for his cautious approach to the country's economic and political troubles. He had been considered a political liability in upcoming parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> made only minor changes in the Cabinet because he helped groom many of the incumbent ministers as ruling party secretary-general, officals said. <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Taipei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was named minister of communications. He replaces <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nan-hung </PERSON> who was made a minister without portfolio. The new premier also fired two ministers without portfolios, <PERSON> Kao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-shu </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun-shan </PERSON>, and named law professor <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien-han </PERSON> to fill one of the vacancies. The second post was not filled. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Cabinet changes were unanimously approved by both President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> and by the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making committee. The party also appointed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soong </PERSON>, 47, to succeed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as secretary-general. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 72, was secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from 1987 until his appointment as premier. His reformist approach is popular with the public, and party officials expect this to benefit the Nationalists in December elections. Professor <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling-chen </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> can be expected to respond to public demands for a clearcut policy toward mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and tackle <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s worsening labor, pollution and economic problems. The Nationalists, who fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, claim they are the legitimate rulers of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They have rejected any official contacts with the Chinese Communists, but two years ago adopted a more lenient policy that has permitted Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade through third countries.

 Nervous and bitter shop owners cleaned debris from their looted businesses Wednesday and complained the thieves included many of their customers. The owners of a supermarket in the capital's <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> suburb retaliated and killed two looters when they opened fire Wednesday on a crowd trying to ransack their shop. The independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> reported the shootings and said police have arrested the shop owners. `` It makes me mad,'' said the owner of `` Dorita'' neighborhood grocery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, a northwestern suburb of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The looters `` took everything and a lot of them were former customers of mine,'' added the shopkeeper, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> immigrant who refused to give his name. `` Someday I'll have to reopen my business, and if I complain too much they may take reprisals against me,'' he said, looking at the broken windows, bent metal shutters and empty shelves. Only a clock on the wall was left inside the shop. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, a largely middle-class neighborhood partially surrounded by slum areas, was the scene of some of Tuesday night's worst violence Hundreds of rioters, many of them slum-dwellers, ran through the streets battling outnumbered police, breaking windows and sacking markets, shoe stores and sporting goods shops. Police and armed civilians filled the main streets Wednesday. The civilians refused to speak to reporters but appeared to be guards hired by shop owners. `` Give us food or we'll break everything,'' a poorly dressed youth shouted outside a market guarded by three uniformed police and two armed civilians. The owner peered nervously around the door. In the only violence reported in the suburb Wednesday, about 200 people looted a small main street butchery. `` They took everything, even the bones,'' said the owner, who also refused to identify himself for fear of reprisals. `` First about 30 people came to the shop, and while we were talking they pushed me aside and ran inside, followed by a lot more,'' he said. He claimed to have seen agitators who told the looters `` to be calm, that there was enough for everyone and if there was n't sufficient meat to go around they would go someplace else. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON>, owner of a small market, pushed a broom across the littered floor of his business, aided by seven employees. `` They took everything, my friend, even the cash register and a broken chair,'' he said in an interview. `` I asked them to just take the food, but they grabbed clothing, wine and coffee. `` It's a good thing my dog was n't here, or they would have taken him too.'' More than 100 persons were milling near a street which links <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> with neighboring <LOCATION> Castelar </LOCATION>, where rioting and looting also occurred Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Senate Leader Calls For Waiver On US-Soviet Trade Limitation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday to waive for a year a provision limiting U.S.-Soviet trade. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should consider permitting Soviet entry into international economic organizations under specified conditions. `` We should clearly indicate that if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will play by the rules, we will welcome it into the game,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The majority leader told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the president, by his proposal this week for mutual cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, took a major step to address the apparently changed nature of Soviet communism under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He called for a comprehensive American and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy to `` seize upon change within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in order to enhance Western security.'' `` Changing circumstances require clear direction and not just a reactive or improvised course of action,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. He said that a symbolic but important first step would be for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment which was imposed in 1974 to prohibit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade concessions until <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> permits free immigration of Jews and other minority groups. The legislation was sponsored by the late Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, D-Wash., and former Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> Addressing himself to the president, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said: `` I urge him to use his authority to waive Jackson-Vanik for a year, thereby helping to normalize economic relations and expand the possibilities for trade.'' He noted that Soviet emigration is rising and that the Soviet government is moving toward legal changes to institutionalize free emigration. `` Now is an appropriate time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to respond to change we have sought for more than a decade,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` We can affirm and encourage further openness within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should build on that step by stating plainly that if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is able to decentralize its economy and institute market mechanisms, `` then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would look positively upon Soviet entry into Western economic organizations,'' including the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also said the administration should move quickly in negotiations aimed at achieving deep cuts in strategic nuclear arms. `` It would be a great loss if we failed to capitalize on the opportunity to reduce the far larger strategic arsenals and to stabilize the nuclear balance,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> gave a tepid reception Wednesday to bills aimed at helping to alleviate the nursing shortage by allowing nurses from other countries to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after their visas expire. `` It is unclear to us how much benefit will be gained by the various immigration proposals that are before this committee,'' Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> is director of the department's bureau of health professions. The subcommittee was hearing testimony on a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that would create a new visa category for foreign nurses whose visas are on the brink of expiring. The subcommittee was also looking into portions of a broader bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said he was worried about thousands of Filipino nurses in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospitals. Many hold visas which allowed them to stay in the country for five years. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> extended those visas for one more year but <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s bill would create a new immigration category to enable the nurses to become <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., subcommittee chairman, pressured <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> to outline the administration's policy on these nurses, noting that the department sent a representative to the hearing with great reluctance `` We're not seeing the leadership we need,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` We would like to know more about where HHS is going in the overall planning and ... what role foreign nurses play in the long run, so that our immigration policy can be integrated with other policies.'' But <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> downplayed the problem of foreign nurses, noting that of some 1.6 million registered nurses working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, perhaps 16,000 are working under visas like those of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> nurses. `` It looks to me like less than 1 percent, and we have to decide whether it's worth the energy it takes,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Puleo </PERSON>, assistant commissioner of adjudications and nationality in the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency found the <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> bill `` too generous in its requirements for special immigrant status.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s bill `` is important to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nurses.'' `` Without foreign nurses, our already over-extended nurses would be unable to cope,'' he said in prepared remarks.

<HEAD>Israeli Warplanes Raid Targets in South Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> bases of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas and a pro-Iranian militia Wednesday in response to increased guerrilla activity in the border area. Police said four jets fired six rockets at a cluster of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> bases east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at 7 p.m.. A two-story command post used by three radical guerrilla factions was demolished, they said, and at least five guerrillas were missing and presumed dead Nine guerrillas were wounded, the police reported. Six F-4 fighter-bombers fired eight rockets at bases of the pro-Iranian Shiite militia <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at 7:15 p.m., according to the police report. A spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Suhmor </LOCATION> village east of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> was destroyed, along with a nearby ammunition dump and a garage used to repair guerrilla vehicles. He said several Israeli helicopter gunships hovered over the bases near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> more than two hours after the raid. `` They dropped parachute flares that lit the night sky as guerrillas were searching with torchlights for the missing victims under the rubble,'' he said. `` We do n't know if the helicopters also bombed.'' The Israeli air raids were the fifth and sixth inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, six people were killed and 45 wounded in the four previous attacks. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli army command said the jets hit `` two terrorist targets,'' east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and east of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>. It described the targets as `` headquarters and ammunition dumps of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'' at which infiltrations were planned. Lebanese police said the bases east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> belonged to the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> led by terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The three organizations have joint bases in hills facing positions of the Israeli-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falous </LOCATION>, six miles east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The militia helps patrol the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains on <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory just north of its border. An Israeli army spokesman said earlier that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed three guerrillas near the Lebanese village of <LOCATION> Hula </LOCATION>, about a mile from the Israeli border town of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shmona </LOCATION>. Two other encounters between Israeli soldiers and guerrillas were reported in the area Sunday and Tuesday, ending a two-month lull in attempted infiltrations of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told cheering Germans on Wednesday that the time is right to make <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` whole and free'' and he called on Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to open up `` the rusting Iron Curtain.'' The president did not directly endorse the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but he renewed a demand that the Berlin Wall be dismantled. `` The world has waited long enough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. `` We seek self-determination for all of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We will not relax. We must not waver.'' The president flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a private evening meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> after a day in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> arranged for maximum publicity. The events included a colorful cruise on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a visit to Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' home, where hundreds of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children whose parents work in the country were assembled to wave paper flags and cheer the president. But the centerpiece was clearly the speech in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>. Showing the confidence that marked his performance earlier in the week at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to dismantle the barbed wire-topped wall erected 28 years ago to divide the old German capital. Throwing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s use of the term `` glasnost,'' or openness, back at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader, he said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> should be `` a place of cooperation, not a point of confrontation.'' As he did during a visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> as vice president in June 1987, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> called for expanded air access to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and the staging of more international meetings and sports events there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as minefields and barbed-wire fences are being removed between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, `` so must they fall through <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He added: `` Let <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> be next.'' The crowd assembled in a hall in this Rhineland city vigorously applauded every reference to erasing the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that followed the defeat of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War II. He praised <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a cradle of democracy, made no reference to the war or its atrocities and said: `` The passion for freedom can not be denied forever. The world has waited long enough. The time is right. Let <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be whole and free.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave the crowd at the ambassador's residence a brief, campaign-style speech. `` I hope what happened in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> guarantees the future,'' he said of the decision taken by the 16 allied governments Tuesday to challenge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with a new proposal for reductions in troops, tanks, artillery and combat aircraft. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called for completion of a conventional forces agreement within a year, but Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> acknowledged on Wednesday that the timetable may be too optimistic. `` A lot is going to depend, quite frankly, on the Soviet response,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The ball now is clearly in their court.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> representatives at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> arms reduction talks were upbeat Wednesday about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals. `` The way is open for a comprehensive agreement on the most destabilizing military units,'' said <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Meiszter </PERSON>. On Air Force One en route to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought his West German visit had gone well in part because of the just-completed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreement smoothing over U.S.-West German differences on short-range nuclear weapons. He said he had arrived `` on an encouraging note.'' Still, signs of the disagreement remained. In <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Herman-Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyel </PERSON> indirectly criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for steering <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> into a proposal for reductions _ but not elimination _ of the weapons, most of which are on German soil. The mayor handed <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> a resolution adopted by the city council that said `` we in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> know there is no escape for us if these weapons are ever used.'' About 250 demonstrators protested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, waving placards reading `` Bush Go Home'' and `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Is Not Welcome Here.'' Police sealed off the main bridge spanning the Rhine and helicopters circled the hall where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is undergoing a second Renaissance in which `` the forces of freedom are putting the Soviet status quo on the defensive.'' He said the West is succeeding while `` on the other side of the rusting Iron Curtain their vision failed.'' Although his stance toward the Soviets was combative, he also offered an assurance that `` our goal is not to undermine their legitimate security interests.'' In mid-afternoon, trailed by television cameras and photographers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, took a riverboat ride to <LOCATION> Koblenz </LOCATION> where he was greeted by fireboats shooting streams of water high into the air. At <LOCATION> Oberwesel </LOCATION>, local wine queen <LOCATION> Ute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>, dressed as a medieval damsel, presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a huge goblet of Rhine Riesling. Confiding that the literal translation of her title of <LOCATION> Weinhexe </LOCATION> is `` wine witch,'' she said, `` The president's eyes opened wide when I told him that.''

 A portrait of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> was unveiled Wednesday in the Legislature, where he began his political career six decades ago, and the governor asked that a new building be named in his memory. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Democrat, champion of the elderly and weaver of the nation's social-welfare safety net died of cancer Tuesday at age 88, the oldest member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The unveiling in the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of the portrait awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Easter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was previously scheduled for Wednesday, and Pepper was to have attended. The portrait will hang in the Tallahassee-Leon Civic Center. `` He always wanted to serve,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Democrat, said at the unveiling. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who has served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1972, is considered a potential successor to his longtime friend. Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Republican, said Pepper had always been a friend to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Cuban community and other refugee groups. `` He did not worry about color; he did not worry about party; he did not worry about creed,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Democrat. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> urged the Legislature to name the state's new <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> building for Pepper. `` It would be fitting to name this important building in state government after a man who, decade after decade, stood tall for the interests of the people he served,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Pepper's public service began with his election to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1928 at age 28. He went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> during the administration of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. He was defeated in 1950 but was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1962. Pepper was to lie in state in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol Rotunda for five hours Thursday, a final honor previously granted to only 26 Americans A spokeswoman for Pepper's office, <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>, said a viewing will be held in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Old Capitol on Sunday and a funeral will be at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, standing on a stage Wednesday with ads featuring beer-promoting dog Spuds <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> beach parties, called for restrictions on alcohol advertising to help curb drunken driving. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support the effort and also proposed much tougher state blood-alcohol standards to determine when a driver is legally drunk, increased taxes on all alcoholic beverages, and a series of voluntary restraints from the industry and advertising media. The recommendations, which arose from a conference <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> organized in December to combat drunken driving, brought immediate protests from distillers and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> said the proposals would `` dramatically increase government intrusion into our lives'' without stopping alcohol abuse. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, in what he said would be his last news conference before leaving office July 13, said he did not support bans on or prohibition of alcohol advertising. But he did ask for some advertising restrictions and bans on some promotional efforts involving alcoholic products. He proposed that alcohol advertising be matched with pro-health and safety messages, financed by the industry or by federal and state government, if necessary. Tax deductions for alcohol advertising promotions other than price and product advertising should be eliminated, he said. Pointing to ads featuring Budweiser's well-known Spuds <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> beer beach parties, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, `` These practices ... tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to athletic, social and sexual success.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> which produces Budweiser, said the dog ads have been used extensively to promote responsible drinking. He said the overall market for beer has been flat for several years and denied that Budweiser aims its ads at young people or tries to encourage people to drink who do n't already imbibe Beer prices would double under <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s proposals, <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON> said. F.A. <PERSON> Meister </PERSON>, president of the Distilled Spirits Council, said the surgeon general's panel was trying to solve drunken driving by eliminating drinking rather than working to make drunken driving socially unacceptable. `` With this type of misguided mindset, it's impossible to develop sound, effective solutions,'' said <PERSON> Meister </PERSON>, who represents liquor marketers and manufacturers. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said, `` Despite all scientific evidence finding no link between advertising and abuse, the surgeon general's report nonetheless would place restrictions on the right to advertise alcoholic beverages which are legal products.'' The organization represents 5,100 radio stations, 970 television stations and major networks. <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said broadcasters contribute $ 1 billion a year in air time and community services against drug and alcohol abuse. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> also recommended extending a law signed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year that for the first time required health warning labels on alcoholic beverages. But he added that mainly he was urging voluntary action on the part of advertisers. `` Please enlarge the warning labels required on bottles and cans beginning this November,'' he said. `` Even a person my age should be able to read the warning without using a magnifying glass.'' The surgeon general urged an end to `` happy hours'' and other price-cutting promotions at bars aimed at increasing consumption. `` These actions may not make people as happy as happy hours do, but they will help keep them alive,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. He also asked the industry to stop advertising on college campuses and at public events attended by young people, to eliminate sponsorship of athletic events, and to end the use of celebrities who appeal to youth in alcohol advertising. Nearly 25,000 people died from alcohol-related vehicle crashes last year, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, with another 534,000 injured. About half of all vehicle fatalities involve alcohol, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said states should reduce the level of blood-alcohol content that determines drunken driving from its usual level of 0.10 percent to 0.04 percent by the year 2000. He said a level of 0 percent should be set for drivers under 21. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> advocated legislation in each state that would allow the confiscation of driver's licenses on the spot for those who fail to pass blood alcohol tests. Excise taxes on alcoholic beverages should be increased, and taxes on beer, wine and distilled spirits should be based on their alcohol content, he said. He recommended that states consider a minimum 5-cent-a-drink tax increase on alcoholic beverages. `` After all, who would quarrel with a ` nickel a drink' user fee that will generate billions of dollars to help save lives?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Police Crash With Demonstrators in Capital Lagos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police in helicopters fired guns and tossed tear gas canisters at demonstrators Wednesday as the rioters erected barricades and set government vehicles on fire. Independent reports said 19 people _ including two who died _ were brought to <LOCATION> Ikeja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with gunshot wounds. There was no official comment on the riots. The clashes were the most violent in the capital since students began rioting a week ago to protest a government austerity plan and school policies. Wednesday's demonstrations began when the government ordered two <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> universities and four technical schools closed to protect life and property in the port city. Students took to the streets, and witnesses said market women and unemployed youth helped them erect barricades around government buildings to stop civil servants from going to work. Workers who managed to enter the buildings later were chased away by the rioters. By noon the streets of the sprawling city were full of rioters, including schoolchildren and traders who closed their stores. Police tried to disperse the demonstrators, who chanted slogans against President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON>'s economic policies and pelted officers with stones. But when they were chased from the streets, officers used helicopters to fire on the rioters. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said troops will guard all strategic installations in the country against demonstrators. The protests began on May 24 at universities in the midwestern city of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, about 160 miles east of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> and since have spread to campuses nationwide. The government has closed 13 schools, and police have arrested more than 200 students in <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> alone, according to newspaper reports. At least six people, including a police officer, have been reported killed. The protesters oppose a government austerity program demanded by Western creditors. The program has caused sharp rises in the price of some basic foods and services. Some students also have demanded changes in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s university system, including the abolition of tuition fees. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted Col. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Chijuka </PERSON>, an army spokesman, as saying that students alone were not responsible for the riots. `` The act can not be the handiwork of students but hooligans in the guise of students,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Ibadan </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oyo </LOCATION> state police commissioner <PERSON> Archibong </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkana </PERSON> said police were investigating the death of a secondary school pupil who allegedly was shot to death during a demonstration Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ibadan </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Nkana </PERSON> said the shot could not have been fired by any of his men because they were not armed with guns, <ORGANIZATION> NAN </ORGANIZATION> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a relaxed day of talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and lunch with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, but Londoners face the chaos of another subway strike Thursday. As the presidential motorcade whisks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 Downing Street residence, the capital is likely to endure more than its usual share of traffic jams. The subway drivers are holding their fifth 24-hour walkout this year, demanding an extra $ 101 a week for operating new driver-only trains. Management is offering $ 47 plus 14 days' extra annual vacation. Following in the footsteps of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who came here in May 1988, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to have talks with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and then head to <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> for his royal lunch engagement. In contrast to the imposing palace, Downing Street is an unostentatious cul de sac in the heart of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, too short to accommodate a full presidential motorcade. No. 10 has been the home of British prime ministers for 2 -LCB- centuries. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is at Downing Street, his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> will be just across the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, visiting an adult education center in the borough of Lambeth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is winding up his European tour in a city which has just enjoyed its warmest, driest May since records began 156 years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that temperatures averaged 61 degrees Fahrenheit, with a high of 84. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> had 308 hours of sunshine, the brightest May since the 315 hours in 1909, and just 0.03 inches of rain, an all-time low for the month. But it forecasts colder weather and showers Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in the afternoon, and may get in a game of tennis before heading back to Downing Street for a banquet given by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. He flies home Friday morning. The president arrived at dusk Wednesday aboard Air Force One from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and was greeted by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> on the tarmac at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Armed police guarded the airport and sniffer dogs were used to check for explosives. After a red-carpet welcome with a military band playing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national anthem, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boarded a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military helicopter with an easy wave and smile to the dignitaries. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> joined him on the 15-mile flight to <ORGANIZATION> Winfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Regent's Park official residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration reaffirmed on Wednesday that it wants to `` strengthen'' the non-communist resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, as it refused to deny a report that it will seek congressional support for a covert program supplying weapons to the guerrillas. There has been opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to such a move, on the grounds such support could fall into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Led by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ran <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 through 1978 and presided over the period in which 1 million Cambodians died. State Department <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, asked about the report published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an assistance program for the non-communist groups that seeks `` an acceptable, comprehensive and stable political solution'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` We believe it is important to strengthen the Cambodian non-communist resistance,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, adding the administration believes this is important in light of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s announcement that it intends to withdraw its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> at the end of September. The spokesman said `` appropriate assistance'' would strengthen the non-communist resistance and `` enhance its position and that of Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>,'' who is trying to oust the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government and its Vietnamese backers. The prince's forces are part of a coalition of armed groups that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Asked if that meant whether he could rule out military aid as a way of strengthening the non-communist resistance, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> replied, `` I have nothing here that would rule it out, no.'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the administration was `` unalterably opposed'' to a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported on Wednesday that the covert aid program would be used to strengthen <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s position in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper attributed the report to unidentified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials, but efforts to confirm the report were unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Communist Party Reverses Official View on Leader of 1956 Uprising</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs of background</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership said Wednesday that former Premier <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who led the failed 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, has become the symbol of reform and a `` significant figure'' in postwar history. The reversal of official policy on <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who was executed in 1958, amounted to political rehabilitation. It comes just two weeks before his remains are to be reburied at an officially sanctioned ceremony June 16 in the same spot where his body and those of his associates were dumped in unmarked graves 31 years ago. `` <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> is a significant figure of Hungarian post-1945 history,'' said a party statement read on Hungarian TV. He `` fought to stop Stalinism in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and ... against foreign intervention and against the counterrevolutionary actions taking place during the uprising,'' it said. Until earlier this year, <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was said to not have taken steps to combat the `` counterrevolutionaries'' involved in the 1956 uprising. In February, the party partially reassessed its view of the revolt, admitting that it began as a popular uprising. The statement, drafted by a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> panel headed by Politburo reformer <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, further reassessed the uprising. `` During the 1956 events, in the midst of the contradictory circumstances on both sides of the opposing forces, many fought heroically and died for causes they believed to be just,'' it said. `` The tragedy was the fratricide itself, and all of the dead are a loss to the nation,'' it said. Mass demonstrations began Oct. 23, 1956, for political reforms and withdrawal of Soviet military forces. Soviet soldiers and tanks rolled into <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Nov. 4 to end the uprising. Official figures said 5,000-6 ,000 people were killed, but Western estimates put the number at 32,000 At a meeting this week, the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed that <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was `` executed in the wake of a show trial and that his sentence was a violation of the law,'' party spokesman <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. Last week, official media said June 16 would be a day of mourning in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his `` fellow martyrs.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s soldiers killed three guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday in the third such encounter this week, and later its planes raided bases of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and pro-Iranian forces blamed for infiltration attempts. Soldiers shot a Palestinian to death in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and two others died of wounds suffered earlier, raising to 503 the number of Palestinians killed since an uprising began in the occupied lands nearly 18 months ago. Twenty-two Israelis have been slain. Ten Palestinians were reported wounded in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and two in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Police detained six Jewish settlers suspected of killing a 13-year-old girl and wounding two other Palestinians in a raid Monday on <LOCATION> Kifil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harith </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. They were identified as students at the <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Tomb Yeshiva in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 12 miles away. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a 4-year-old Arab boy was killed when he stepped on a mine near the border with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister for <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs, said a new policy in Ariel, a Jewish settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, that requires <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers to wear tags saying `` alien worker'' was `` insensitive, unintelligent and immoral.'' The policy, announced Tuesday, inspired comparison with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> forcing Jews to wear yellow stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, mayor of Ariel, said all workers would wear the tags, not just Arabs. A military spokesman said the border skirmish Wednesday occurred near <LOCATION> Hula </LOCATION>, a Lebanese village about a mile from the Israeli town of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shmona </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said. It was the third encounter in four days in the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains just north of the border. Sources in the Israeli-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia, which helps patrol the zone, said the guerrillas were trying to attack a militia position. The two clashes Sunday and Tuesday, described as infiltration attempts, broke a lull of more than two months in guerrilla efforts to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A total of three guerrillas were killed. An army spokesman said troopers spotted the guerrillas Wednesday, opened fire and killed them immediately. The spokesman, who can not be identified under army regulations, said there were no Israeli casualties. Reporters in <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shmona </LOCATION> were shown the bodies of the guerrillas, in white plastic bags, and four AK-47 assault rifles army officials said the men carried. On Wednesday evening, the army command said, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jets raided `` two terrorist targets'' near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It described the targets as `` headquarters and ammunition dumps of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'' that were `` point of planning'' for the infiltrations. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militia, and the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group is a non-PLO guerrilla faction supported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Lebanese police said four jets made the raid on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> bases east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> at about 7 p.m., and six struck <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> about 15 minutes later. At least five guerrillas were missing and presumed dead from the attack on the Palestinian forces and nine guerrillas were wounded, the Lebanese police reported. They gave no casualties for the attack on Hezbollah targets. Arab doctors identified the Palestinian killed Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as 20-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Habab </PERSON> and said he was shot in the chest in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>. They said five Palestinians were wounded. The two Palestinians who died of wounds suffered earlier were identified in Arab news reports as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawas </PERSON>, 18, shot Tuesday, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Farajani </PERSON>, 15, wounded May 14. Palestinians throughout the occupied lands observed a general strike Wednesday that was ordered by Moslem fundamentalists to protest what they called Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s `` curse against the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.'' The strike referred to a newspaper interview in which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must not make territorial concessions to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> because they `` might say, ` Let's cheat the Israelis just like <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> did.''' Palestinians `` always bring these examples of how <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> used all sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in the interview published earlier this month.

 The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that Scottish police were convinced the bomb that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people, was put on board the plane at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, chief constable of <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> who has led the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> investigation, said the investigation was now at a stage police had not envisioned when they started. `` That means that I am hopeful and optimistic for a reasonable conclusion,'' said <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, who is moving to a new post as chief investigator of constabulary for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, transport spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, urged Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to discuss the issue with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Wednesday night at the end of his European tour. `` If the German security authorities are hindering the inquiries by the British and the Americans, then something must be done to stop that,'' <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> on Dec. 21 while bound from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. No arrests in the bombing have been announced. But on May 22 the West German magazine <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said an Arab bomb expert linked to the sabotage was arrested in October with 15 other people in raids on Palestinian homes that also netted explosives and weapons. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> identified the man as Jordanian-born <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>. It said he was released 15 days later because he worked for the West German intelligence service, and then returned to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the service denied the man was a West German agent. <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s chief federal prosecutor's office, said May 22 that investigators could not find enough evidence to keep <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> in custody, despite suspicions about him. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was believed to make bombs for the radical Arab group <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>James Claude Wright: No One `Can Take From Me My Inner Peace'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-House Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Years ago, before he was speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wrote an `` affirmation'' to himself on three pieces of scratch paper and vowed to carry it always. By now, the words are surely faded, if not soiled. `` No person can take from me my inner peace, for I shall quietly, calmly, gently, pleasantly hold onto it _ for it is mine, a gift of God.'' `` I shall be open to new things, new thoughts, new truths that I can learn from other people. I have performed well in the past, and I fully expect success in the future. `` I deserve to have happiness, career success, and economic security. The Lord wants me to have them. Because I like and respect myself, I am not adversely affected by the attitudes of others. If they think they do not like me, it is because they do not know me.'' Now, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the second most powerful man in government, most powerful in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is leaving his beloved <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ not just adversely affected, but laid bare by others, foes and friends alike, whose shared farewell is a sigh of relief. He brought himself down, perhaps, by failing to abide by that pledge to learn `` new truths,'' namely those arising from profound changes in political morality since he came to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an era of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bosses and cronies. Or, perhaps, his colleagues and the nation failed to know him, to truly hear him out until it was far too late to correct the damage to his credibility and reputation. That can be argued for years. Eighteen months ago, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> merely laughed when Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., began raising <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> over reports that the new speaker had promoted bulk sales of his book, an unscintillating compendium of speeches, to escape <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income Nor did <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> seem to perceive any basis for concern over the subsequent allegation that he accepted gifts worth $ 145,000, involving an essentially no-work job for his wife, from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> developer friend. But his world had virtually crashed down upon him by the time he rose on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday in solemn defense of his honor _ and especially that of wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>. And despite what he portrayed as a thorough rebuttal of all the charges, he asked, in tears, `` to give you back this job you gave to me, as a propitiation for all of this season of bad will. `` I do n't want to be a party to tearing up this institution,'' he said. `` I love it. ... I'm not a bitter man, I'm a lucky man. God bless this institution. God bless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He quoted <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON>: `` Fame is a vapor, popularity is an accident, riches take wings, those who cheer today may curse tomorrow. Only one thing endures: character.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, as his `` affirmation'' suggested, did yearn for a secure financial life, something he did n't have for much of his adulthood, even as a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. An abortive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign in the 1960s, the breakup of his first marriage and the needs of four children kept him seriously in debt. He fell deeply in love with <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, a longtime staff aide, after he separated from his first wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethelyn </PERSON>, in 1970. But, to <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>'s consternation, he balked at remarrying because of that debt. `` I thought I was doing the lady no favor,'' he said. She finally prevailed, in 1972. `` I had to talk him into it,'' she once recalled. `` I said, ` We can get out of debt. We can make it. And we did.''' To this day, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 66, regularly writes romantic poetry to her. Anyone who has seen them together, cooing like lovesick teenagers, knows that his first loyalty is to her. His salary and investments have put his assets well into six figures, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> does not live lavishly. He still drives an aging Chevrolet around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and lives in the suburban <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, house he bought in 1982 for $ 228,000, a modest figure by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> standards. What the scrappy, bushy-browed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> truly burned for since arriving in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 34 years ago was the speakership, even if he had no illusions about its grandeur. He once put it this way: `` I had more raw power when I was mayor of <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION> than I've had in any job since.'' There was the morning he was still in bed when an old woman called to complain to the mayor about the wicked little boys shooting BB guns at the songbirds in her yard. Barely had he hung up, when another woman, on the opposite side of town, called to complain about all the sparrows roosting in her eaves. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> drove to the first house, picked up the boys and transported them to the second. `` Ever since, I have yearned for some set of problems amenable to that kind of direct action,'' he said. `` You do n't find those opportunities in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Perhaps. But he never quit trying to find them. Months before his predecessor, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, stepped down as speaker in late 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told his colleagues he intended nothing less than to tip the balance between the legislative and executive branches back in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. To some extent, that has happened, as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> abandoned one domestic initiative after another to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in his last two years at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, focusing instead on foreign policy. And even this year, embroiled as he was in his own difficulties, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his colleagues have assumed a more equal role with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in formulating consensus policies over the budget and other key issues, including <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But Republicans complained that within <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was even more partisan than his predecessor. `` With Tip, there was warmth and affection,'' said former Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, R-Wy., now secretary of defense `` There are no such feelings for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was being run by `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his goons.'' Even though a 1981 poll by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report named <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as the most respected member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he has never lacked for detractors, even among Democrats. They included Reps. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, both of whom thought of challenging him for the speakership. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> surely did n't rise to the leadership heights by the sheer force of personality. Unlike <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, he rarely unwound with his colleagues in the cloakrooms or the capital's night spots, swapping stories and good whiskey. Instead, he was a loner who, while invariably cordial, revealed little of himself and family. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> once said: `` You do n't have anecdotes about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>. Maybe that's an anecdote.'' He is a far greater master of the language than <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, though his oratory, usually begun with a calculated arch of his trademark eyebrows, tends toward the tedious and never worked well on television. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> tells the story about how, a few years back, he was growing more and more irritated with the progress of <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s energy committee on a complicated bill: `` I was forever exhorting them, I'd get impatient and say, ` Hey, look, time's a-wastin' This is an important problem and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has got to have a solution to this thing. Here you are, sitting around here pecking out and dissecting and extruding to the mind the flaccid tissues of long-dead issues offensive to God and mankind. Let's get on with it, boys. `` And finally, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said, ` Now, Glorious Leader. You have admonished us in approximately those same terms at least on five occasions. I would suggest that if you're truly intent upon expediting the proceedings, we should just designate that speech you just made as speech No. 1, and whenever you feel impelled to exhort us to greater efforts, just hold up one finger and we'll know it's speech No 1, and it will save us a lot of time.'''

 Despite <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s pledge to hold onto inner peace, his temper is legion. A former Golden Gloves boxer, he once threatened to punch out Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lungren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor When Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., cursed at him, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> promptly invited him outside to settle the issue <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s climb through the ranks was rooted, more than anything else, in sheer, hard, political work. In the four years preceding his election as speaker, he traveled to more than 250 congressional districts, raising more than $ 1 million for candidates, collecting chits. His own political history runs the Democratic gamut, first parochial and populist, then increasingly liberal. He was one of a few Southern congressmen who refused to sign a petition opposing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1954 desegregation decision, but he voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He evolved into a national Democrat preaching fairness and help for the downtrodden, but retaining a down-home interest in protecting banks and oil operators. He favored a strong defense, but led the fight against the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Raupe </PERSON>, a former aide who died last October, once said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was `` as complicated as <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> _ just not as mean.'' Even <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> was once something of a fan. `` He makes everyone feel part of the institution,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said in 1986. `` I remember asking him once for floor time. He could have finessed me ... instead he took 30 minutes and gave me 30 minutes. Things like that, if he does it, draw 90 percent of the poison out of this place.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was born on Dec. 22, 1922, in <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION>. He father ran <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a profitable small business that specialized in arranging promotional gimmicks like sack races and pie-eating contests for local merchants. Young <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> was educated in the public schools for <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` My goal,'' he once said, `` was to be a football coach. But in my junior year in high school, I injured my knee, and the coach suggested that since I could n't play football, what they really needed was somebody to represent the school in debate. And since he was also the world history teacher, I was forever trying to impress him with how smart I was ... I got hooked.'' At age 19, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> to become a B-24 bomber pilot in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, where he won a Distinguished Flying Cross and the Legion of Merit. At age 23, he ran unopposed for the state legislature; served as mayor of <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION> from 1951 to 1954; and, at age 32, was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Now, 34 years later, this is his darkest hour. But he still has the light of his life, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, to whom he wrote for their 14th Christmas together: `` You're the dearest, truest part of every day I live `` The thought of you within my heart is all it takes to give `` me hope that I ... can work and learn and grow `` Yet grateful be, for I have more than any man I know. `` For it is true, in all I do `` It is n't I, it's ` We,' `` In all of this, I do thank you `` For not giving up on me.''

 A black woman who says racial harassment forced her and her two young children to abandon the first house she ever owned said Wednesday she will not try to return to the all-white neighborhood. `` They do n't want me, I'm not going to fight,'' said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>. `` Those people just do n't want me to live there.'' Ms. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, 29, grew up in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and works for a nonprofit agency that monitors abused and neglected children. She said she and her children, ages 1 and 2, moved into the home May 13 and left eight days later. `` I was naive when I came here. I just wanted to live in a nice neighborhood,'' she said. `` I thought all that black and white stuff was something from the'60s. I did n't meet it in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> or in the Army or even in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.'' She said she heard a racist comment the first day in the neighborhood. Two days later, she said, she found her garbage can overturned and a fish skeleton on her doorstep. Later, she said, rocks were thrown through two windows. Some residents said <ORGANIZATION> Brunner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION>, which handled the sale of the $ 27,250 row house, never should have shown her a house in an all-white neighborhood and should have warned her that it was not mixed. `` Blacks start moving in and property values go down and white people start running,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sintic </PERSON> said. `` They should n't run, in my opinion, but they do and realtors end up making fortunes.'' Pizza shop owner <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Borschell </PERSON> said the real estate company `` made that woman a victim of society.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>, who sold Ms. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> the home, said the real estate company did exactly what the law dictates. `` The woman came in here and wanted to buy a house and we sold her a house,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingerman </PERSON> said he could not comment on the agency's investigation. Lt. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the Police Department's <ORGANIZATION> Conflict </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said his team's investigation will be extremely difficult `` unless someone is willing to step forward and tell us who did it.'' `` Had she stayed there, maybe we could have done more,'' he said. `` The incidents would have continued and we could have made an arrest.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said his unit investigated 175 such incidents in the city last year and that reports of harassment have remained steady over the past few years. Ms. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, who is staying with friends, said she plans to stay in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` First, I have to sell the house,'' she said. `` I want to move where there are blacks and Hispanics in the neighborhood.''

 Words such as `` shimmery,'' `` carnivore,'' and `` hopperdozer'' flowed trippingly over the tongue Wednesday but `` blas,'' `` nasturtium'' and `` macadam'' proved too difficult as the 62nd National Spelling Bee winnowed out the best from the just very, very good. The record field of 222 local champions was cut by 71 in the first three rounds. The 151 remaining will battle through more difficult rounds on Thursday until there are just two vying for the title. One will miss, one will succeed and the national champion will be crowned. By the end of three rounds, 601 words had been spelled, a lot of tears had been shed but there also were some very happy _ and, often, lucky _ survivors. Thirteen-year-old <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, almost _ but not quite _ made it through `` machtpolitik,'' power politics. But she spelled it with a `` c'' at the end. Nine-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishimaru </PERSON>, a fourth-grader from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ the youngest contestant _ made it through all three rounds with `` mountebank,'' `` blolly'' and `` reflorescence.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Raytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, survived `` empirical'' and `` ellipticity'' but failed on `` mignonette.'' There was one small moment of drama when 11-year-old <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, a 6th grader from Fort Necessity -LRB- La. -RRB- High School spelled `` scordatura'' so softly that the judges had to replay a tape recording that officials use for such situations. She waited nervously as the judges listened to the tape two or three times. They finally decided she had misspelled the word by using a `` t'' instead of a `` d.'' The word means tuning of an instrument to produce a special effect. When 14-year-old <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, got the word `` boulevardier,'' she asked several times to have the word repeated and then said `` Oh, God, can I buy a vowel?'' _ a steal from the game show `` Wheel of Fortune.'' In this competition, however, there is no such help available. Ten-year-old <PERSON> Malinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, one of the youngest contestants, was the first to be eliminated, misspelling `` seriatim'' as `` seriatum.'' The word means `` in a series.'' <PERSON> Malinda </PERSON> took advantage of contest rules that allow the speller to ask for a definition of the word, then its use in a sentence, and even what it is derived from. She took her loss bravely and walked off the stage with a contest official's arm around her. The two-day competition, which carries $ 16,350 in prize money, has attracted 120 girls and 102 boys who survived elimination contests around the country and in American outposts abroad. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blow </PERSON>, a 14-year-old from <LOCATION> Sayre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, foundered on `` macadam,'' spelling it `` mecadom.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Getz </PERSON>, 13, from <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, spelled `` nasturtia'' instead of `` nasturtium,'' and <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, Ill, had `` blasse'' instead of `` blas.'' The word means `` to blow.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 12, from <LOCATION> Whitman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, spelled `` sluice'' as `` sluece,'' and <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON>, 11, from <LOCATION> Oreana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, left the final `` e'' off `` supervene.'' `` Veneer,'' became `` vaneer'' from <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Strohmaier </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In the competition at the start were six 10-year-olds, 24 who are 11, 45 who are 12, 89 who are 13, 55 who are 14 and two who are 15. Competition is limited to those under 16 and not yet beyond the eighth grade. Nearly 9 million students participated at the local level in contests sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION> in 13 cities and by 205 other daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers. The winner will receive a cash award of $ 1,500. Other prizes are $ 1,000 for second, $ 750 for third, $ 500 for fourth, $ 400 for fifth, $ 300 for sixth, $ 200 for seventh through 10th, $ 100 for 11th through 20th, and 202 prizes of $ 50 each. Seven of the contestants are making their third appearance in the national competition; 30 are here for the second time.

<HEAD>Pentagon Stops Government Dealing With Borden Pending Criminal Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, citing an on-going criminal case against former executives of <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has temporarily suspended the company's dairy division from doing any business with the federal government. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> was informed of the action in a notice dated May 25, the Pentagon announced Wednesday, adding the suspension will remain in place `` pending completion of legal proceedings.'' `` The suspension is based upon adequate evidence to suspect that the employees engaged in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by rigging bids for the award and performance of contracts to supply milk for school children in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the criminal cases against the former <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> executives originated in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and did not involve contracts to provide milk to federal agencies. `` However, because of the nature of the allegations _ dividing up territory for bid rigging, et cetera _ we just thought it was prudent to protect the government's interests until we do know if similar conduct occurred on our bids,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> during the first six months of fiscal 1989 spent $ 4.5 million buying <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> dairy products for military commissaries. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spent at least $ 700,000 a year in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> areas of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cases involved former managers of <LOCATION> Borden </LOCATION> plants in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> executives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> declined immediate comment Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement or the effect of the suspension on the business. Beyond the criminal cases, the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has recovered $ 32 million from milk producers and distributors involved in what has been described as a 10-year price-fixing scheme that resulted in overcharges for nearly half the state's 67 school districts. Of that $ 32 million total, a settlement of $ 10.4 million was paid by <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s suspension was based on the indictments of three former <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> executives: <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribble </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Lenard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Each of the men were charged in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> with rigging bids and violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Under federal procurement regulations, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to act as a so-called executive agent on behalf of the entire government when dealing with instances of contracting irregularities.

 The discovery of bogus exposive devices that closed part of a coastal highway during Memorial Day weekend was traced to a `` performance art'' show that went awry. The show Sunday night included an act in which realistic black powder canisters were distributed among the 2,500 people who paid $ 8 a ticket to see the performance, staged in a parking lot, said officials of <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, producers of the show. Three objects that looked like bombs were found Monday along the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and two more were found in the <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Headlands </LOCATION>. Another canister was found Tuesday on the beach, and three others near the lot where the late-night show was staged. The palm-size canisters, with lettering reading `` High Explosive _ -LCB- pound of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>,'' actually were filled with plaster of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` But they looked like the real thing, like <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ordinance canisters,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. As the park service and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began investigating, <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday night that the canisters were among 100 to be used in the show. `` The fake bombs were supposed to have been hoisted in 30-gallon trash bags by a big remote-controlled crane with an electromagnetic plate attached to the bottom of the lift,'' said one production company employee, who asked that his name be withheld. When the show ended, a number of people scrambled to pick up the devices, putting them in their pockets, the employee said. <ORGANIZATION> Survivial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> was created by a group of engineers, welders and artists who stage machine demolition derbies.

 Prices farmers got for raw products rose 2.7 percent from April to May and averaged 13 percent more than a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Increases in the prices of hogs, oranges, potatoes, broilers and tomatoes were partially offset by lower prices for sweet corn, eggs, lettuce and soybeans, said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in a preliminary report. But broiler, potato and tomato prices were at record levels. Hogs also increased sharply from April. Demand for oranges was so strong that the average price was higher than it has been since November 1987. Cattle prices continued close to April levels. Wheat and corn prices were up slightly while soybeans were down from a month earlier. Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock and livestock products was up 2.6 percent from April to May, and 4.6 percent above a year ago at this time. Compared with April, higher prices for hogs and broilers more than offset lower prices for eggs and milk. Crop prices, overall, rose 3.6 percent from a month earlier and 24 percent above a year earlier. The overall index of prices paid to farmers in May averaged 151 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 70.10 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, steady with April The average is for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 42.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 36.30 in April and $ 46.30 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.58 a bushel, up from $ 2.56 in April and $ 1.98 in May 1988 _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 4.07 per bushel, compared with $ 4.03 in April and $ 2.97 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 6.53 per 100 pounds, down from $ 6.66 in April and $ 7.97 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 7.15 per bushel, compared with $ 7.29 in April and $ 6.98 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 57.7 cents per pound, compared to 59 in April and 58.3 cents a pound in May 1988 _ Eggs were 54.3 cents per dozen, compared with 58.1 cents in April and 33 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 12.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 12.30 in April and $ 11.40 a year earlier _ Broilers were 45.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 39 cents in April and 33.7 cents a year ago

 Populist firebrand <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> urged the new parliament Wednesday to take power and end 72 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. He blamed the party and President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for continuing economic decline. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a member of the party leadership, told fellow deputies of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that the presidency is accumulating too much power and could become a dictatorship. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must take power into its own hands'' if the political and economic restructuring begun by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to succeed, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said on the sixth day of the popularly elected parliament's inaugural session, He called for an immediate transfer of authority from the party and suggested the president submit to an annual referendum on his performance. The session, broadcast live to the nation, has seen unprecedented public criticism of the Soviet leadership. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> kept a stoic face throughout <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech and scanned the hall for reaction. Most deputies politely applauded. Members of the party's ruling Politburo who attended the session and sat in a special section of the hall did not clap. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s performance of the past four years has been criticized since the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened, and many deputies questioned him sharply before they elected him to a second term as president last week. At that time, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised he would not take advantage of the increased powers of the presidency. Another deputy proposed constitutional amendments recognizing the 15 Soviet republics as sovereign states with the power to control their own resources, make their own laws and shape a new relationship with the Kremlin. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, which have defied the Kremlin by declaring themselves sovereign with the right to overturn Soviet laws, had been expected to propose such amendments. But the sponsor turned out to be a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege, <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> is a union, a multinational state, formed on the basis of agreement, equal republics, with self-determination of nations,'' <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> said. `` Only the republics can delegate power to the union.'' He said a redistribution of power was needed `` to eradicate the roots of ethnic tension.'' <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> whispered with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the following speech and conferred again during the next break, but the president did not respond publicly to the proposal. The highest-level comment on <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>'s radical proposals came from <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, elected Monday as vice president. He said the proposals may go too far and called for a combination of central, republic and local control. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> ripped into <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for denying knowledge of what happened when troops that were dispatched to break up a pro-independence demonstration in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, killed 20 people. `` In no circumstances is it possible to accept that the head of state does n't know the circumstances of the case,'' <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, what kind of head of state is he?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a commission to investigate the incident. <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> also criticized the long-sacrosanct <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police, charging that `` the best people of the country were tortured in its basements'' and it remains almost uncontrollable, continuing to dominate the lives of all citizens. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech was packed with proposals, and his fellow deputies sat riveted to their seats when he demanded the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seize power from party leaders who are `` the same people who have not managed to get society out of its crisis in politics, the economy, finances and the standard of living.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who became a hero to many Soviets by demanding a better life for the common people, said `` the threat of financial collapse has become real'' since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was named <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader in March 1985. Tens of millions of people live in poverty, he said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> proposed the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> grant free medicine and mass transit to invalids and the poor and suggested it convert special hospitals and clinics for the elite to health centers for mothers and children. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a member of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also called for removal of many of that policy-making body's members, saying they have proved incapable of solving the nation's problems. Despite his harsh words for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s proposal on transferring power from the party to the government could have <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support, Deputy <PERSON> Revaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabakashvili </PERSON> said later. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said his reforms are designed to separate the government and party bureaucracies, get the party out of day-to-day public affairs and let the popularly elected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its full-time legislature set policy and law with the guidance of a strong president. One deputy noted that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> chose Wednesday's speakers, including <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, from among the 440 deputies who asked to comment on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address on Tuesday. Since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heads the party and the government, he would not be threatened by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s proposal. But thousands of party bureaucrats in every organization in the country, from a tiny Siberian factory to the ruling Politburo, could stand to lose power. Vice President <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> told reporters afterward, `` I think the party's position in our country is just fine and precisely defined in Article 6 of the Constitution.'' The article says the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is `` the leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system.''

 Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in an uncomfortable spotlight after a Memorial Day visit from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, wrote an angry letter Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> demanding a probe of news leaks. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> assured the fourth-ranking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrat that he had ordered `` a full investigation'' into leaks saying the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had begun a preliminary probe into allegations that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> may have had a ghost employee on his payroll. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Plebani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s staff director, said Wednesday, `` Every employee who works for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> comes to work and does work. He's a very demanding boss. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is seeking the post of majority whip being vacated by Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. In his letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> questioned why the department waited `` until the eve of Democratic leadership changes to inform me or ask my cooperation.'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., one of <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s opponents in the whip's race, also complained, `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are fed up with the effort to use innuendoes and rumors to discredit our public officials We must stop this destructive politics of character assassination.'' Government sources told several news organizations Tuesday that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had been visited by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who were conducting a preliminary inquiry. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> denied that he had done anything wrong and suggested in an evening news conference Tuesday that the allegations were politically motivated. `` I was told over and over again I was not the subject of an investigation,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. He said he'd been told that the bureau was `` looking into allegations about an employee or employees.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> wrote a sharply worded letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> demanding an independent investigation of the source of any leak. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> responded, `` Prior to receiving your letter, I had ordered a full investigation of the apparent unauthorized disclosure of information in this matter.'' The purpose of the investigation, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` is to uncover any possible wrongdoing within the department or elsewhere and to prevent such leaks in the future.'' In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> said Wednesday that the bureau would not `` confirm nor deny that there is an investigation under way.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> disputed suggestions that top department officials leaked information for political reasons. `` If that is going on, it's going on at a lower level of the department,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The spokesman described <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as `` disturbed by leaks that have come out of the department concerning matters which have led to news stories on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` If there is some attempted interference here in the actions of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus it is of concern to us,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Last Thursday, the attorney general asked Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> `` to look into the unauthorized disclosure of information'' leading to stories that <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> were being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was conducting a preliminary inquiry into investments that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> made through the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Demond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> testified Wednesday that slain movie producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> feared `` there might be some trouble'' on the night he disappeared because of <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s ties with the film `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' On May 13, 1983, <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> assigned <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, former star of TV's `` Sanford and Son,'' to follow him with a gun as the producer headed for a business dinner at a swanky <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> restaurant, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s testimony came in a preliminary hearing in the `` Cotton Club'' case in Municipal Court to determine if four people should stand trial for the abduction-slaying of <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>. `` He asked me to follow and just watch and see if anything happened,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` He said that there might be some trouble. He said that something might happen to him as a result of his association with the ... ` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.''' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who acknowledged that he had drug habit at the time, said he lost <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s limousine in traffic on <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and never saw him again. The 33-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman's body was found a month later in a dry riverbed about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He had been shot in the head repeatedly. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s testimony conflicted with that of his former secretary, who testified earlier that she was with <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and saw <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> pull off the boulevard followed by another car full of men, but said she and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> did not follow. Under questioning, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he used cocaine, alcohol and pills in 1983. Asked by an attorney whether he underwent a drug rehabilitation program, he said, `` No, sir. I found Christ.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is now an evangelical preacher in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Defense attorneys attacked <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s account of <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s last night, saying the actor never before told anyone that <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> expressed fear. `` He was pretty fearful,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> insisted. `` There was a lot of anxiety around him. ... It was not a fear that somebody's hands were shaking. It's something that a friend knows.'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> describe his friendship with <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> and the last night the producer was seen alive. The prosecution contends that reputed drug dealer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLayne </PERSON> `` Laynie'' <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> arranged <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s murder after they fought about her share of profits from `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' She is charged with murder along with <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, former bodyguards for Hustler magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is fighting extradition in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. On the night <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> disappeared, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he visited <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> in his hotel suite and `` That was when I saw the crux of his anxiety.'' He said <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> asked if he had a gun, which <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> did, and arranged for him to come along to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> restaurant, where <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> was to dine with Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was assigned to follow in his own car. The actor said he offered to call the police, but <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> declined. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> brought his secretary and also had a reservation for dinner. But he said the plan went awry when he lost <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s limousine in traffic He said he began to follow but got stopped at a red traffic light. By the time he turned onto <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, he said, he was about 10 cars behind <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>. He said he continued on to the restaurant, but <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> never showed up. Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, attacked <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s story, pointing out discrepancies between his current account and what he told police in interviews following <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s disappearance <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> then asked, `` Do you have a recollection of telling anybody before today that Mr. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> was expressing fear, nervousness or anxiety on May 13, 1983?'' `` No,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Wednesday aimed at encouraging television networks, local stations and cable systems to reduce graphic depictions of violence, drug use and sex on TV.

<TEXT>
 A former federal judge with a reputation as a corruption fighter and an ex-Wall Street prosecutor were among three watchdogs appointed Wednesday to oversee <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union operations. The appointments, announced at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, were part of the settlement of a civil racketeering lawsuit against the nation's largest trade union. `` Honest union members and the public at large are entitled to a decent and honest union _ free of criminal influences and corrupt practices,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. `` Today's appointments are an important first step in that direction. The three appointed are: <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>, a former federal judge and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON>, former head of the commodities and securities fraud unit of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, former general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The three will oversee various union functions until late 1992. <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a 15-year veteran of the federal bench, became known for prosecuting corruption while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> that led to the conviction of several political figures. As administrative officer, <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> will have the same authority as the union's international president and executive board to veto union expenditures, disciplinary actions and appointments. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, will oversee the union's 1991 elections and will have the right to supervise the union's 1996 elections. He was general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 until last January. <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> were both sworn in Wednesday by <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, who approved the out-of-court settlement in March. <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON>, 38, who will investigate alleged corruption in the union with the right to file charges against <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> officials, members and employees, will be sworn in later, said the judge. In 1986-87, <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON> headed the federal criminal probe of figures in Wall Street's insider trading scandals, including <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said the trio's task `` is enormous in scope and importance'' but they `` are more than up to that task. Their ability, dedication and integrity can not be questioned.'' `` We're very pleased with the appointees,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, the union's general counsel. `` The interest of a clean and democratic union are consistent with the goals of the present leadership.'' The three posts were created as part of a settlement of the government's massive civil lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, Chauffeurs and Warehousemen. The lawsuit, filed last June under the civil aspects of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, charged that the top leadership of the union was dominated by organized crime and had `` made a devil's pact'' with the Mafia. The lawsuit noted that four Teamsters presidents since the 1950s have faced federal felony charges and three were convicted: <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> for embezzlement; <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> for obstructing justice and mail fraud and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> for trying to bribe a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. The fourth, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, the union's president at the time the lawsuit was brought, died while under indictment for alleged embezzlement. Twenty-five of the 26 reputed mob figures originally named as defendants have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such as extortion, embezzlement and illegal labor payoffs. Most were dismissed from the case when they either agreed, or were ordered, to drop any involvement with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. The settlement between the union and federal prosecutors, reached just hours before the case was to go to trial, also called for the direct election of international officers by the rank and file. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> leaders, whom the government sought to oust, were allowed to remain in office.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> at an East-West human rights conference Wednesday of repressing and driving away thousands of people, but <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> told other nations to keep out of its internal affairs. Earlier in the day, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> appealed to the conference to help ethnic Turks who have been subject to an assimilation campaign in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> are expected to be singled out as nations that routinely violate human rights by the month-long 35-nation Conference on the Human Dimension, which began Tuesday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It is being held in the framework of the <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accords </ORGANIZATION> on human rights. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief delegate <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> told delegates that more than 20,000 people had fled <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in the past 18 months to escape political and economic repression. He said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> now `` turns its back'' on the human rights commitments it made with other nations. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has come under heavy criticism from nations including <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, its Communist bloc neighbor, for a program to destroy thousands of villages populated by ethnic Hungarians and resettle their populations in industrial centers. However, <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ene </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s delegation, said the delegates should ignore their mandate to examine specific cases of human rights abuse. He said such a process would interfere with a nation's sovereignty `` I want to underline that the domestic and foreign policies of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> are decided in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and not in just any capital,'' he said. Challenging Ene, <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference: `` Sovereignty does not give a state a right to oppress its own citizens.'' An emigre source said a leading Romanian dissident, <PERSON> Doina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornea </PERSON>, was beaten and kicked by Romanian police for the second time this month when she tried to leave home May 18. <PERSON> Mihnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Berindei </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, that it was not known if <PERSON> Cornea </PERSON> was allowed to receive medical treatment in a hospital. Emigre sources said the dissident was also beaten earlier this month and told she would not receive a visa to attend the human rights conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Turkish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> said ethnic Turks face irradication as a national minority in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. He called <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s assimilation campaign `` one of the gravest human rights violations of our time.'' <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> started the drive in 1984, forcing ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones and forbidding use of the Turkish language and Islamic worship. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has said three people were killed over the weekend in rioting by ethnic Turks. Turkish emigres sources say up to 30 people died. Some ethnic Turks at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference say <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is imprisoning, torturing, exiling or killing those who resist assimilation. The London-based human rights group, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, says about 100 Turks died fighting the campaign and thousands were jailed. Bulgarian President <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> has blamed the charges on a `` campaign of slander'' by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and Western groups. Also Wednesday, Bulgarian exile sources said a union leader who planned to attend the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference was arrested May 26. The sources in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenchev </PERSON>, chairman of an independent <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, faces charges that could jail him for up to 15 years. They said he had helped ethnic Turks draft a resolution publicizing their grievances.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Subsidize Local Freight Rail Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to continue subsidizing local freight railroad lines that otherwise would be abandoned because of little traffic. As a budget-reducing measure, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called for ending the 16-year-old subsidy program once the $ 10 million appropriated for this year was spent. But on a voice vote with no dissent, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill by Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, to continue the program with the intent of providing some $ 50 million in new aid through 1993. However, the new legislation increases from 30 percent to 40 percent the local share required for federal matching funds to acquire and repair tracks and terminal facilities. None of the federal aid can be used to subsidize the operating costs of the lines. The program originated in the government's bailout of the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1970s when shippers and local communities were faced with the prospect that thousands of miles of track would be abandoned. It was expanded nationwide in 1976.

 Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who disappeared while trying to negotiate freedom for American hostages more than two years ago, turned 50 years old Wednesday. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was on his fifth mission as personal representative of Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> when he dropped from sight Jan. 20, 1987, in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He was last seen leaving the seaside <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> at 7:30 p.m. to meet the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers of two Americans. In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s family observed the birthday quietly, praying for his safe return. His wife <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> and brother <PERSON> David </PERSON> had an `` entirely private'' meeting with <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> at Lambeth Palace, the archbishop's residence, a church spokeswoman said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> said the family believes his brother is alive. `` Our faith takes the pressure out and we can relax in the knowledge that at the right time <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> will be released,'' he said. On the night he disappeared, the policeman's son who became a spiritual leader's personal emissary told his Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort him to the clandestine meeting. Well-informed sources said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was driven to the home of a Shiite Moslem physician who had acted as go-between. He apparently was to make contact with representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, which holds <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> never returned. Nothing has been heard of him since. No group claims to hold him, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government says no ransom demands have been made and there have been no photographs or videotapes from the kidnappers to prove he is alive. Other Western hostages freed since, however, have reported seeing a man believed to be the bearded, 6-foot-7 Briton in an underground prison. Druse chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was held by the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappers holding most of the 18 missing Westerners. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> denied it. Many rumors circulated after <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s disappearance. He was reported ill, released, killed, wounded while trying to escape and smuggled to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Submarine's Hull Cracks Stem From Manufacturer's Failure, Company
Says</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two cracks discovered in the hull of a nearly completed nuclear submarine stem from a failure of the steel manufacturer and went undetected by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials and the ship's builder for five years, the submarine builder said Wednesday The Electric Boat Division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which described the cracks in a memo to lawmakers last week as `` quite severe,'' said repairs have been completed and apparently would not impact on the Sept. 30 commissioning date of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION>, a SSN-688 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> class attack submarine. Electric Boat spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said metallurgical tests conducted by the <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, sub maker showed that the steel plate in question developed a defect during the manufacturing process. The steel maker, <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, initiated repairs, but `` did not completely eliminate the defect in this plate when they made the repair,'' <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The cracks were present prior to or during heat treatment following the repair. While it is not uncommon for a vendor to correct defects in steel plate used in submarine construction, it is rare that cracks remain after this repair,'' Electric Boat said. The cracks were on the area that had undergone repairs, <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>, said the steel maker would withhold comment until it receives <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the findings. That report had not been received by the end of business Wednesday, he said. The steel plate was manufacturered by <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> plant and delivered in 1984, <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> said. The Electric Boat order was among the last for the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> plant before it was shut down, he said. <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON>, when asked how the cracks could have gone undetected by company and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> inspectors for five years, said, `` It could have gotten bigger over time. I think that's the best explanation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and company officials refused to describe the cracks, saying the information was classified. But The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> reported that one was a 2-inch long hairline crack and the other was smaller. The cracks were discovered by a foreman during preparation for painting the hull at the <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION> shipyard. <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said it was not immediately known how much the repairs cost Electric Boat. The question of liability would be addressed in the future, he said.

<HEAD>Yeutter Announces Wheat Set-Aside</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced Wednesday a required 5 percent acreage reduction and several other provisions of the 1990 wheat program. `` We need more wheat,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, in explaining why the set-aside was not higher. Under the law, the agriculture secretary each year must decide what, if any, acreage should be set aside in order to keep surpluses down. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> could have asked for a greater acreage reduction or none at all. The 5 percent figure is dramatically lower than past set-asides during times of great surplus. In recent years, farmers have been asked to cut back the amount of land devoted the crop by as much as 25 percent. Currently, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supplies are low because of the past success of the set-aside program and because of two years of drought. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said price support loans and purchase rates would be $ 1.95 a bushel, a 20 percent reduction from the basic loan and purchase rate of $ 2.44. This is the minimum allowed by law and 5 percent below the 1989 loan and purchase rate of $ 2.06 a bushel. He also set the established target price at $ 4 a bushel, the statutory minimum and down about 2 percent from the 1989 target price. Furthermore, he said would not implement paid land diversions, marketing loans or related programs. No secretary since 1985 has implemented these programs for wheat or corn, partly because prices have been high and there has been no need for them.

 Police said the partially naked, manacled body of the wife of a political opposition leader was found on a beach early Wednesday, three days after she was reported missing. <PERSON> Arah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>, wife of <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>, disappeared from their farm Sunday.

Police said they had detained a man employed at the farm, where Mrs. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>'s glasses and parts of her clothing were found on the ground Sunday. They said there was no indication of the motive. The body was partially buried in the sand, with the hands tied behind the back and clothes wrapped around the neck, police said. They speculated that she was killed on the farm and buried at the beach. Mrs. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>, in her early 40s, had three sons and led the Marxist party's Women's Action Group. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Wednesday and was traveling in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last week.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should make full use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leverage to discourage Chinese leaders from cracking down on students demonstrating for democracy, a former chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disarmament negotiator said Wednesday. In the coming days, `` hard-line elements in the government and the armed forces may crack down on the students and workers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s democracy movement,'' involving serious abuses of human and political rights, former negotiator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> now is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, an independent U.S.-based policy organization that promotes human rights and civil liberties throughout the world. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cooperate on military, economic, cultural, scientific and educational programs `` which the <LOCATION> Peoples </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> finds very much in its interest,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said. `` This is the time for the ... <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make it clear that such relationships as these may come under greater public scrutiny in our country and may not be sustainable if the established <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership attempts to preserve its rule by abusing the basic political rights and civil liberties of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>'s letter said. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> returned last month to <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after more than three years as chief negotiator for former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administrator in the strategic arms reduction talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` We at <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> believe it is wrong now not to hold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the common standards the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> uses in judging a country's performance with regard to human rights,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said.

 Provincial governments opened soup kitchens and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> increased social benefits Wednesday in bids to end a week of food rioting and looting that has killed 15 people, most of them trying to get food. President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> met on Wednesday with outgoing President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who was forced to declare a state of siege two days earlier. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> indicated he will work closely with the government on the economic crisis that sparked the looting, but he again refused to take office early. `` I do n't want to interfere with the desire of President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> to serve out his mandate,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, of the labor-based <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and winner of May 14 national elections, told reporters. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is to step down Dec. 10. The two agreed to review the 1989 budget and put more money into health and nutrition programs, increase state revenue from customs taxes, and coordinate policy on public salaries, utility rates and the $ 59 billion foreign debt, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said. Small-scale looting was reported in the provincial capitals of Corrientes and <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, and in the working class neighborhoods of <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>' industrial belt Two teen-age boys and a 50-year-old man were killed during a raid on a supermarket and food warehouse in <LOCATION> Moreno </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and a 9-year-old boy died of shotgun wounds suffered the day before in rioting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>. The independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> quoted police as saying they arrested shop owners who shot and killed the <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> looters, but did not say how many were involved in the shooting. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd trying to break into a supermarket in western <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s fourth-biggest city `` I had hoped to live what's left of my life in peace and quiet, but now it seems more likely that I'll die in the middle of a war,'' said <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>. In general, however, the violence appeared to subside. `` Calm reigns throughout the country,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON> said before Wednesday's deaths were reported. But there were none of the confrontations the past two days brought between security forces and mobs in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION> city. Six people were killed Tuesday in the capital and five the day before in <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>. At least 70 looters and bystanders have been shot and wounded, and dozens more injured by tear gas, stones, sticks, broken glass and fists. More than 2,000 people have been arrested. An elite coast guard squadron was sent Wednesday to <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>, 186 miles north of the capital, to help 2,000 border guards there establish order. Police were stationed at supermarkets throughout the country. `` They took everything, even the bones,'' a butcher in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> said Wednesday, moments after his store was sacked. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON>'s nearby supermarket was looted the day before. `` I asked them to just take the food, but they grabbed clothing, wine and coffee,'' he said as he mopped up spilled milk and mayonnaise. The riots began last week in <LOCATION> Mendoza </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, the second-biggest city, after months of devaluations caused price rises far ahead of wage increases and prompted nationwide layoffs and shortages. Real wages have shrunken to 35 percent of what they were in December 1983 when <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office, according to a survey by the conservative Center for a New Majority. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved the 30-day state of siege, increased state pensions and allocated more money for social services. At the insistence of the Peronists, legislators raised the minimum pension for retirees to $ 36 a month and for widows to $ 33. On Tuesday, the monthly minimum wage was more than doubled to $ 44. Provincial governments on Wednesday set up soup kitchens and charity drives, lowered water and electricity tariffs, began negotiating with businessmen to prevent layoffs, and made plans to halt building projects and funnel more money to social programs. In <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> late Tuesday, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> called the Argentine situation `` extremely difficult, because their economic situation keeps getting worse.'' He blamed industrialized nations for not offering solutions to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic crunch, saying `` they close the doors on us'' when it comes to negotiating the region's $ 410 billion debt. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> suffered looting and rioting in February after <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced economic reforms, with 300 people listed officially as killed.

<HEAD>FTC Chairman Says States Must Regulate Cosmetic Surgery Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State regulators, not the federal government, must take the lead against false and misleading advertising and promotions involving cosmetic surgery and other medical procedures, a federal official said Wednesday. That assertion by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was challenged by other officials who told a congressional panel that states sometimes are hampered by federal policies. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said `` False and misleading advertising for cosmetic surgery is, and should be, a matter of concern to all agencies and organizations, public and private, at both the federal and state level.'' But, he added, `` Such procedures are generally practiced and promoted at a local level and, therefore, consumer protection must, at least initially, be the prime responsibility of the state medical boards and the state consumer protection authorities.'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> also rejected any commission responsibility for physician competency in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy. But the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'s view was `` an absurd rewriting of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> role in protection of consumers. He said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> was trying `` to make the states ... take the lead in areas the states say they are powerless to deal with.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> told the subcommittee the issue of false and deceptive medical advertising is too complex and costly for the states to handle. `` Various FTC and court rulings have made it extremely difficult to discipline a doctor solely on the basis of advertising with the exception of the most blatant violations,'' <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said, although he was unable to provide an example. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> contended the commission's antitrust law enforcement program presented no obstacles to effective state regulation and said rules that might suppress broad categories of truthful advertising were not the answer to the problem. Instead, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said, the agency's 1979 order lifting the ban on medical advertising and all subsequent orders expressly instructs or permits medical professionals `` to deal effectively with all forms of deceptive advertising.'' But <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said the only recent communication his state has had with the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> was when the commission questioned whether the state's censure of two doctors for deceptive and misleading advertising might place illegitimate restrainst on truthful advertising `` Contacts by federal agencies whenever such actions are taken does cause consternations and may have a chilling effect if the result is to become embroiled in actions brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, R-Calif., suggested state regulators could remove federal jurisdiction from issues like medical advertising through action by state legislatures Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiners </ORGANIZATION>, testified he'd been instructed by the state attorney general `` to stay out of advertising'' because the state could n't be sure of what constituted false advertising

The judge earlier had struck down a more restrictive curfew measure. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a spokesman for district councilmember <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who had helped draft the two previous bills, had expressed no intention of writing a third. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, said neither <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> nor other top city officials intended to pursue the matter. The curfew, aimed at keeping teens from congregating in the district's notorious open-air drug markets, would have prohibited anyone under 18 from gathering outside after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnight on Friday and Saturday. The curfew would have been lifted each day at 6 a.m. The city's second curfew bill included exemptions for teens traveling in cars or with their parents or when returning from work. In addition, those returning from school and church-related functions also were exempt. However, <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> ruled that the measure would have subjected thousands of law-abiding city teen-agers to `` virtual house arrest.'' The local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> brought both suits against the city.

 The prospect that Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> will replace <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as speaker of the House was greeted enthusiastically Wednesday in the majority leader's home state and congressional district. `` It's no secret that we feel he would be the best choice for the job,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchioro </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairwoman. `` Personally, he's very urbane and civil. He's a rock, really, and right now, that may be what we need.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has been a steadfast supporter of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and during appearances in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state last week repeatedly urged the speaker not to step down. But in the wake of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics investigation into his financial dealings, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would ask for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to elect a new speaker on Tuesday. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a 13-term congressman, is not expected to face a challenge to succeed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by moving up from his No. 2 position in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, 60, was a protege of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's two most powerful politicians, the late Sens. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> `` Scoop'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A self-described parliamentarian and pragmatist, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is best known for his attempts to build bipartisan coalitions, rather than clinging to party ideologies. `` Although I wish to proclaim I've always been totally satisfied with the innocence of Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, I think that -LRB- <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s speakership -RRB- will be a tremendous boon to the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, to the eastern district of the state, and to the nation,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> lawyer and Democrat `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s my good friend,'' said <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON>. `` I would personally advise him to beware of being too compromising with these Republicans, because I'm satisfied the actions against the Democrats are a political ploy, much like the McCarthyism of the'50's. `` He's going to have to learn to fight.'' In his 13 campaigns, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has rarely had to fight, earning a reputation for gentlemanliness and always saying nice things about outgunned opponents in his largely rural 5th Congressional District. `` He certainly represents a district that would be one of the more conservative districts in the state, but he represents our party well,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Marchioro </PERSON>. `` He's got to be, next to Scoop and <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> -RRB-, one of the most popular elected officials in this state.''

 The burden of ending what <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called `` this season of bad will'' now rests with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democrat who will inherit <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s job next week. And virtually no one thinks there's a better man for the challenge. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who presided over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended his honor and abdicated his office, will lay full claim to the gavel when he is formally elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' most powerful job. He will bring to the speakership a less partisan style that fits perfectly with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for accommodation between the executive and legislative branches. As House majority leader, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, 60, has won admiration from both sides of the aisle for his command of issues and tireless negotiating skills. He is a master at finding consensus and striking compromise. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acknowledged in his farewell address that `` perhaps'' he had been `` too partisan, too insistent, too abrasive, too determined to have my way.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is none of those things, as any <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> will tell you _ to the dismay of some Democrats. Like <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s political roots trace to the New Deal of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, but he is no knee-jerk liberal _ and would n't have lasted in the House if he were Unlike most leaders whose seats are `` safe,'' he is from a distinctly Republican and conservative district that has put him through many close elections, though he won last year with 77 percent of the vote. Though hand-picked for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s elite by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his predecessor, former Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> never shared their penchant for bashing the Reagan-Bush administration or other Republican opponents. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> admired <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> most for qualities he admittedly did n't possess himself _ meticulous craftsmanship of legislation, thorough command of the issues, attention to organizational detail. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> once said, in both exasperation and respect, `` is a man who can see three sides of every issue.'' `` The reality is that in a modern, participatory <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... the responsibility of leadership and the necessity of leadership is to constantly involve members in the process of decision and consensus,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> says. According to Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., the troika of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and soon-to-resign Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has worked like this: `` Jim ... the captain, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> the oar drummer and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> the navigator Democrats in the House and most Republicans have great respect for the navigator.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s office furnishings reflect his eclectic approach. Instead of the big, imposing desk preferred by most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he has a coffee table surrounded by enough sofas and chairs to accommodate at least 18 visitors. He does his paperwork at a small writing table in the corner. And <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and his coffee table have been at the center of some of the most important legislation, invariably compromises, to emerge from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in this decade. Just this year, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was host of the extraordinary talks that in mid-April produced a budget agreement for the next fiscal year, and he was pivotal in the bipartisan deal with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy. A year earlier, he chaired the economic summit sessions that followed the October 1987 crash of the stock market. Prior to that, he engineered the final agreements on the Gramm-Rudman budget law, and arms control policies shared by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is just a very able, capable individual,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the House Republican leader. `` He's well-liked on our side, and he's also recognized as a very formidable opponent, one who will state the case well, and is eminently fair.'' `` He's a man of total integrity,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` He knows the players, knows the issues. And this, from Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>.: `` I wish he were a Republican If he were, he could be a presidential candidate.''

 House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., is in line to become Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week with the resignation of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> But a scramble is underway for other Democratic leadership posts. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who has been in the No. 2 post for the past 2 -LCB- years, was the only candidate for the top <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> position although he did no campaigning for the post prior to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s announcement. `` Now there is a vacancy,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said late Wednesday, adding that he expected <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> would begin calling his colleagues. A caucus of the ruling Democrats was scheduled for Tuesday to nominate <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> for the speakership. Jockeying was intense for the other top party positions, which will turn over both because of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation and the announcement last week by the third-ranking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrat, Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., that he would step down It was not immediately clear on Wednesday whether those positions would all be elected at Tuesday's caucus, but party leaders were said to be eager to get the party organized and moving forward in the wake of its unprecedented congressional crisis. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, was considered the favorite to replace <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as the majority leader. His competitor for the post was Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a more conservative <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat. The race for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s post of majority whip, the speaker's chief vote-counter, was a wide-open contest among several prominent party members, including: _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, currently the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is fighting bad publicity from reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations that a no-show employee was carried on his office payroll. _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, currently the chief deputy whip _ <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a powerful member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Two lawmakers were running to become <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>.

But some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers worry about what they regard as extremist elements within his political party. Some Arena party members are accused of having links with death-squad activities and are scornful of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emphasis on protection of human rights, contending it impairs the war effort of the Salvadoran army against leftist guerrillas. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appears to have convinced <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> should continue to receive substantial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid, arguing successfully that <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> should not be penalized before he even takes office. Administration officials and congressional sources have said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in fiscal 1990 is expected to remain at $ 85 million, about $ 12 million less than the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had requested. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> planned private meetings with both <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and will play host on Thursday to all foreign officials and dignitaries attending the inauguration. `` These are exciting times in which change toward greater freedom is sweeping the world,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said in a statement. `` But we must all remember that with burgeoning freedom comes sobering responsibilities for leaders everywhere _ responsibilities to protect human rights such as free speech and peaceful life.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> lost at least $ 300 million because <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> copied the design of its super-absorbent diapers, an attorney said Wednesday in final arguments in a federal lawsuit over Pampers and Huggies. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> forecast it would make that much money annually from its super-absorbent Pampers, said attorney <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstein </PERSON>, who was representing the soap, toiletries and disposable diaper giant. But sales were $ 150 million below projections in each of fiscal years 1986-87 and 1987-88 after <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> violated the Pampers patent and introduced super-absorbent Huggies, <PERSON> Gerstein </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawkins </ORGANIZATION>. Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> wants <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> to order <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> to stop manufacturing super-absorbent <PERSON> Huggies </PERSON> and to remove them from store shelves. The company also is seeking unspecified money damages. About $ 3.3 billion worth of disposable diapers are sold each year, according to industry officials. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> is the industry leader with about 47 percent of the market while <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> is No. 2 with about 30 percent. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> is expected to rule in the non-jury case sometime this summer. If he decides <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> is liable, damages will be determined in a separate proceeding. Twenty-three witnesses testified and about 4,100 exhibits were introduced during 17 days of testimony in the trial that began last month. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> contends that researchers <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> developed a way to combine wood pulp fluff and super absorbent materials in diapers to allow them to be made thinner. The company has argued that <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> violated its patent on the process when it later introduced its super-absorbent Huggies. But <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble never had a valid patent because it provided misleading information to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent Office. Patent attorney <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION>, testified that if the patent office's examining officer had known about earlier work on a similar process by an Italian inventor, the patent would never have been issued to <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble. In his closing arguments, <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> totally, independently developed its Huggies super-trim diapers.'' The super absorbent material in <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s test-marketed diapers did not work well, <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> said, and they leaked. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble addressed the problem in later versions of its diaper products that included concentrating areas of super absorbers and manufacturing double-layered diapers. The trial is being held here because <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> has a a diaper manufacturing plant at <LOCATION> Beech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> border.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the personnel practices of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s non-voting delegate to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has been extended to examine all of his hiring records for the last five years, The Associated Press has learned As part of the wide-ranging inquiry, a grand jury intends to begin hearing testimony from current and former employees of <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, a Democrat, and Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., over <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s hiring of <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s son, according to sources familiar with the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, the son of Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, was paid $ 21,398 while on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll between September 1987 and June 1988, but swore on <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> election documents that he was living in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during that time. Those records were filed as part of his unsuccessful bid to win an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. Individuals from the <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> offices will be subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury within the next month, and investigators have already subpoenaed payroll documents and office personnel data from the two congressmen, said sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Those records have been requested to determine whether the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, his father or <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> falsified payroll documents or offered false statements to investigators. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> declined to comment when asked whether documents from their offices had been requested by federal authorities. When contacted by telephone in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> declined to comment Wednesday. In addition, investigators are examining the personal banking records of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> to learn whether he returned any money to his father or <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the sources said. Investigators are also closely examining accounts of the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s job duties submitted voluntarily to federal officials by <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s chief aide, and several other <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> staffers, sources said. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> refused to comment on the documents when contacted Wednesday by a reporter. While the statements from <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s staffers describe <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> as regularly showing up for work, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> has reported that investigators have been told that the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> showed up in Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office on an almost-daily basis during the period he was supposedly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On several occasions, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reported, office workers there allegedly were told by staffers in Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office to keep the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> away from windows to prevent anyone passing the storefront office from seeing him. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> opened the case with a 90-day preliminary investigation in December, shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reported on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s hiring of the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Criminal Division then recommended that Atorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> appoint a special prosecutor to look into the case under the terms an order by his predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. That rule, instituted by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> just days before he left office last August, required an independent prosecutor to examine cases of alleged wrongdoing by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> scuttled the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> order and turned the probe back to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, which traditionally handles such cases.

 House members, reacting to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s emotional resignation speech, said Wednesday they supported the speaker's decision to step down because charges of ethics violations had ended his chance to be an effective leader `` The price paid was so disproportional, but he did the only thing he could do,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defender <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, citing an `` emotional burden'' that made it `` impossible to go on.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` correctly recognized the utility of his speakership was over,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who was chairman of a panel that wrote many of the ethics rules President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a fellow Texan, saying in a statement, `` In spite of the present situation, I believe the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he hoped members listened carefully to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s urging that Democrats refrain from thoughts of avenging the resignation, and that Republicans not try to retaliate for the defeat earlier this year of the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> for secretary of defense. `` He did an awful lot of good as speaker,'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> added. Immediately after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made his announcement, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, stood at the same podium on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and expressed his fears about the `` evil wind blowing in the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, former chairman of the ethics committee, warned that if the present mood remains `` the end result will be to destroy this institution as we know it today.'' House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation was a sad time for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, but added, `` It is also an unprecedented opportunity for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to begin a bipartisan, comprehensive reformation of this institution and its rules And Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` like a war zone right now where you do n't know when the next bomb is going to drop.'' He said a time for healing is needed, but warned that if House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who filed the original charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` wants to engage in open warfare, there will be a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who waged a vigorous public battle against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, avoided reporters as he left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s speech But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Liberal Democrats can obviously dish it out to good and decent conservatives ... but they ca n't stand the heat in the kitchen. The ethics war they started has turned against them. Conservatives do n't want scalps. They want fairness.'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who was involved in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s `` parting gift was a warning to stop'' the vengeance <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had no choice but to resign rather than fight the charges. `` He knew what the toll of that battle might be,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressman said. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., expected to be elected majority leader after the elevation of Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to speaker, praised <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s record `` Under <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s leadership the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation on trade reform, plant closing, the drug problem, welfare reform, housing, aid for the homeless, clean water and other important measures,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> has a record of public service that he can be proud of.'' Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his party planned to use the resignation as a campaign issue unless Democrats passed an election reform package acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel truly sorry for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as a human being'' he added, but called the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case an example of corruption that occurs when one party is in control of an institution for too long. `` I believe that in his heart he does n't believe he did anything wrong,'' <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., called <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s speech `` a very poignant, emotional moment in American history It was almost like <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>, a prince on his knees.'' `` He missed his calling; he should have been a trial lawyer,'' Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` If he had been giving a summation to a jury he would have walked.''

 Police swinging clubs and firing tear gas quickly dispersed a demonstration Wednesday night by about 1,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> students in the capital of restive <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province. The police, carrying machine guns and wearing riot gear, charged protesters who had shouted `` Freedom! Freedom!'' and demonstrated for two hours against what they said was harassment of ethnic Albanians by <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> authorities. The demonstration was held in front of the downtown university dormitory, and the rally and dispersal were witnessed by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter. Officers moved in at about 10:30 p.m. after a brief warning to the demonstrators to disperse. Police launched tear gas canisters and charged the protesters with truncheons. Demonstrators ran in panic inside dormitory buildings. Windows and glass doors were shattered in the shuffle. Several protesters were seen being taken away in police vans after the action. However, no one appeared to have been seriously injured and the police action took about five minutes. This was the second day of protest against constitutional changes passed in March that gave greater control over this Albanian-dominated region to <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, of which <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has been an autonomous province. On Tuesday about 2,000 demonstrators, demanding to see a visiting European Parliament's delegation, probing alleged human rights violations in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, dispersed peacefully. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, Yugoslav Premier Ante <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> on Wednesday told the delegation it would be allowed to meet prominent ethnic Albanian dissidents. `` We were not able to fulfill our task in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> because we were not given the opportunity to meet with people from the other side,'' Danish member <PERSON> Frode </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristoffersen </PERSON> said after the delegation cut short its visit to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The five-member delegation arrived in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> on Tuesday during a new outbreak of unrest in which one ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> died in nearby <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Charriot-Schneider </PERSON>, secretary of the mission, said the group had planned to stay in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> `` for three full days, but we are leaving after 13 hours.'' `` We are quite disappointed because the talks with ethnic Albanian intellectuals and other members of the opposition were absolutely necessary,'' <PERSON> Lilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Seibel-Emmeling </PERSON>, a West German member, said. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.8 million people are ethnic Albanians. The Serbian minority complains of discrimination in the southern province, which borders on <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and is an ancient Serbian heartland. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosetti </PERSON>, an Italian member, said the delegation had been kept from meeting six <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> legislators who voted against the constitutional amendments and who he said were indicted and now are awaiting trial. He complained that <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> would not arrange a visit to jails housing ethnic Albanians accused of organizing demonstrations and riots in February and March. The unrest killed at least 24 people and a state of emergency was declared in the province. At least 60,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> took part in protests after <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, adopted the constitutional amendments providing greater control. About 800 ethnic Albanians were arrested and 237, including former provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vllasi </PERSON> and other prominent politicians, businessmen and intellectuals, were detained without charge under federal emergency laws. At least 47 are still being held in isolation around <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s delegation, headed by <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, said they also wanted to talk to <PERSON> Vllasi </PERSON>, who is awaiting trial. `` Even though we were officially invited by the Yugoslav government, we have a feeling they wanted to shorten our visit,'' Ms. <PERSON> Charriot-Schneider </PERSON> said. `` The conditions of the visit made us fail in doing our job.''

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned his leadership post Wednesday under a cloud of ethics charges, becoming the first speaker in the nation's history to step down under fire in mid-term. `` Let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation for all this season of bad will,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said near the end of an emotional hour-long defense against allegations of financial wrongdoing. He said he also would resign his congressional seat before the end of June, ending a 34-year career as a representative from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to a hushed, nearly packed chamber, with his wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> and his daughter <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> sitting in the visitors' gallery. Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wept when he announced his decision to resign. `` All of us in both parties must resolve to bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an end. There's been enough of it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> declared, asking fellow Democrats not to try to get even with Republicans. Colleagues gave him a standing ovation, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a statement saying, `` In spite of the present situation, I believe the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication.'' He wished <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife well. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s move cleared the way for the elevation to the speakership of Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and for a string of other changes that would complete a shift to a new, post-World War II generation of leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The resignation, which will become effective after the new speaker is elected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, came after a year-long, $ 1.5 million investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee that led to formal charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in 69 instances. Many of the specific charges involved two main allegations: _ That he used bulk sales of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' to hide contributions from groups to which he had spoken _ That he received $ 145,000 in benefits, including a no-work job for his wife, from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> businessman with an alleged direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The charges, which preoccupied <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in recent weeks, caused widespread concern among the Democrats who elected <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> speaker three years ago that his effectiveness as the party's highest elected leader had been permanently damaged Some also indicated, usually in private, that they were worried the issue would hurt them in next year's elections. The ethics committee postponed a meeting that had been scheduled for Thursday to take action on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss the most serious charges. One Democratic source sympathetic to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he believed the ethics panel now would drop the case entirely. In his floor speech, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> argued forcefully and in detail against the charges, contending Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had researched investments for the small company owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> and the Mallicks and earned her salary and the use of a car and condominium <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> provided. And he repeated his contention that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had no direct interest in legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also contended his book was not a scheme to evade outside earnings limits, as the ethics panel alleged, but a legitimate publishing venture. He challenged the ethics enforcement process, which he said had been `` agonizing'' for him, and suggested it should be reformed. `` Perhaps we might want to consider outright aboliton of all honoraria and speaking fees altogether,'' in exchange for an increase in federal pay. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> repeatedly wiped his brow during his speech. At times his hands were shaking. He worked alone in his office on the statement, then walked to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to deliver it. His resignation had been expected since last week, when his lawyers and members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee discussed the possibility of an arrangement under which some of panel's major charges against him would be dismissed in return for his giving up the speakership. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself has consistently denied knowingly violating ethics rules, but his political support among Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eroded steadily as the ethics committee methodically investigated his finances. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., said the resignation would not hurt the House `` What it really represents is the moving of a new generation of political power into this place,'' Obey said, alluding to the earlier selection of Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader. `` With the ascent of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> into the leadership you have a total changing of the guard.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, in a statement, called <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` a symbol of constancy, courage and commitment to principle'' who would go down in history as `` a great speaker.'' Some <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> supporters were bitter. `` There is an evil wind blowing in the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that is reminiscent of the Spanish inquisition,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Added Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who listened to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber: `` After 35 years of effective and able service to his state and to the nation, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> deserves better than this. `` The whole last year has been a living nightmare for him,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The House Republican leader, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said while the resignation was a sad moment for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and personal tragedy for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` it is also an unprecedented opportunity for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to begin a bipartisan, comprehensive reformation of the institution and its rules.'' One Democratic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had concluded last week that he would have to resign after he received word that the ethics committee was poised to reject his motion to dismiss the most serious charges. Few took the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> matter seriously in December 1987, when Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., announced plans to file a complaint against the speaker with the ethics committee Common Cause, the government watchdog group, called for an investigation five months later. The ethics panel opened deliberations June 2. The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned on Oct. 22, with one of the most productive records of recent years under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s leadership, and the ethics committee continued to take testimony into the fall and winter. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was re-elected as speaker on Jan. 3. On April 3, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> conceded that he might have `` unintentionally'' and `` technically'' violated some rules, but defended his intentions as good. As the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reeled from nearly daily allegations of new scandals, ethics committee chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Wednesday that innuendoes of wrongdoing were `` getting out of hand. The latest to hit the Capitol was word from government sources that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating allegations that Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., had a no-show employee on his payroll <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> denied wrongdoing. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is a candidate for majority whip, the No. 3 Democratic leadership post left vacant by the weekend resignation announcement of Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. The Pennsylvanian questioned the timing of the word about the investigation. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> faced his own ethics problems over a junk bond investment, and said he was choosing to get out rather than subject the party to another protracted ethics probe.

 In the city <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> represented for 34 years, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker's resignation Wednesday prompted fear, sorrow, anger at Republicans and little surprise. `` Anybody who knows anything of the American political process knows the loss of the speakership is a major loss for this area,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON>, whose city has long counted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as a major asset in attacting defense jobs. Officials said it may be impossible to rebuild the political power or match the economic gain the region enjoyed from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 34-year tenure and his leadership in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` We just lost our right arm in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>,'' state Rep. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, who represents the city in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` I think he got a dirty Republican deal. I think they were after him, and they finally got him.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned under a cloud of ethics charges. `` I disagree with Mr. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s implication that he was treated unfairly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, which investigated and charged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, acted in a fair and bipartisan manner. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, the state's only <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor this century, praised <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s efforts for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` This is not a good day for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has done a fine job representing the state in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and his years of service and leadership in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be sorely missed.'' As pressure against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> grew this week, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politicians began talking about potential replacements. State Sen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, a Fort Worth Democrat, was frequently mentioned to serve the remainder of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 18th term in the House. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> can call a special election no sooner than 30 days and no later than 90 days after the date of resignation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would step down as speaker as soon as his colleagues choose a replacement and that he would resign his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat by the end of June. The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, predicted trouble for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> if a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> tries to win <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s seat `` I do n't think there'd be a real reservoir of good feeling towards Republicans,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` If I were a Republican, I think I'd wear a flak jacket in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, who describes <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as his `` oldest and closest political friend,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s decision was `` a loss for all of us.'' `` Nothing that has occurred can take away from the immense good this man has done for his district, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Hungry children eat because of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Homeless people have hope because of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. American boys are not dying in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>. In <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 12th Congressional District, people gathered around televisions in an electronics shop to watch his resignation speech to the House. `` I think it's horrible,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON>. `` He's the only one I could call on for help when I needed help. ... He's the only one that has ever really done anything for anyone for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I think it's a shame and disgrace that the news media has challenged his integrity.'' At a federal office, workers turned on the radio and cheered as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended himself in his hour-long speech. One woman yelled `` Touche!'' as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> dismissed the ethics committee's charges. Minutes later they fell silent as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` I give you back this job ...'' The employees went back to work. They declined to give their names. In <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION>, the ranching town about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> grew up and served as mayor in 1950-54, Mayor <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> called his resignation plans `` truly awful.'' `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> has done us a wonderful job up there and I was truly hoping that he would continue on,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` Being the third most powerful man in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he was able to do a lot for all of us. This is an attack on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. I am anxious for people in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to pick up from this and go on,'' she said.

 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> offers for the record affidavits from five individuals who attest that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned her $ 18,000 salary. -RRB- ... The outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s employment somehow amounted to a gift. ... Does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes? So many pages of typed manuscript? She was n't a carpenter. Is a woman's mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a work product ... For most of her adult life Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been a business person, been an officer in a large hotel, an officer in a successful real estate and construction firm, a professional staff person on a congressional committee. She was making more than $ 18,000 when she worked at the congressional committee. And here's the irony. The supreme irony. In 1976, when I was elected majority leader, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> voluntarily left her job as a professional staff person on the committee so as to avoid any criticism ... Now it just seems to me there is n't any justification at all for anybody's even raising questions about whether she earned her $ 18,000 a year. ... <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> -LRB- also -RRB- had the use of a company car. That is true, she did. ... I want to do the right thing, the honorable thing. I bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds. ... What more can I do. Does that make it right? Now concerning the apartment ... We did n't think there was anything wrong with paying a per diem rate. ... We paid on a daily basis for our use of that apartment. ... Nevertheless, last year I said to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, I said, I want to buy the apartment. ... I paid the amount suggested and appraised by two real estate persons in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, $ 58,000. ... I just wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say if we've made a mistake we've done what we can to set things right. I do n't think we've violated any rules. ... The second alleged violation continues on the assumption ... that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, our friend and business partner, had a direct interest in influencing legislation, which would make it illegal for us to accept gifts from him. ... I've known this man for more than 25 years. He's been my friend ... Never once in all the years that I've known this man has he ever asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation. ... Not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any institution in which he has an interest. ... Now the only other basic question, it's just one that remains, in the statement of alleged violations, concerns the sale of a book, a little book now you'll recall `` Reflections of a Public Man'' which I wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities. People who took it and gave it away to other people _ students, newspapers, public officials and members of their organizations. And I wanted them to. I wanted to get the widest possible distribution of the book. ... Now, the contention ... is that this book project ... on which I got $ 3.25 for every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed and violate the outside earnings limitation of a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. ... If monetary gain had been my primary interest, do n't you think I would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the houses there that give you a big advance? It is true I think that people on my staff were eager to sell these books. They knew I wanted them sold. I've got to accept some responsibility for that if it was wrong, but the rule does n't say it was wrong. ... The rules expressly exempt royalty income. ... I did n't intend to try to violate the outside earning limitations and I do n't believe legally that I did. ...

 About 300 soldiers marched in formation near student-occupied Tiananmen Square Thursday as conservative leaders turned up the heat in their campaign against the pro-democracy movement. The government's show of force was the first of its kind near <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> since a sit-in for a freer society with less corruption began May 13. The troopers from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> marched in front of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Hotel near <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> about 6:30 a.m. and turned down a side street. It was not clear how many of the thousands of students camped in the square saw the procession. `` I think they were just sent to try and scare us,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON>, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, who saw the troops pass by. `` But I did n't think anyone was scared. They did n't come that close and not many students knew they were there.'' The government Wednesday held its first rally in response to six weeks of pro-democracy protests. But a torched effigy of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident and slogans supporting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'s hard-line policies failed to rouse the 4,000 people who attended the rally 20 miles outside Many participants said officials told them to attend. Thousands of noisy marchers, meanwhile, trooped from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> to police and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Wednesday night to demand the resignation of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who have led the crackdown on the popular uprising for democracy. Conservatives are trying to discredit the student movement and consolidate their position in a political power struggle with moderates. The marchers, primarily students, beat drums, pots and pans, and chanted `` Down with kidnapping!'' to protest the arrest this week of three leaders of an independent labor union. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinglu </PERSON>, head of the trade union that was formed in sympathy with the pro-democracy movement, said the men were released Wednesday after police questioned them for a day. The government rally at a stadium in Daxing county was staged by supporters of conservative leaders who reportedly have stripped moderate <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> of his post. `` We will oppose whoever opposes <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>,'' read one banner. Others supported martial law for central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, decreed by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> on May 20 after more than 1 million people took to the streets to demand more democracy and an end to corruption among officials. The government rally, attended by peasants, workers and high school students, lacked the enthusiasm of the pro-democracy demonstrations that have been mounted in major cities. The burning of effigies of astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, an outspoken dissident who has campaigned for democracy, and an unidentified `` schemer,'' an apparent reference to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, failed to stir the listless crowd. Few people joined rally leaders in shouting `` long live the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' and other slogans. Some giggled and others waved tiny flags instead. `` I think this is a sham,'' said a 26-year-old worker shortly after the rally ended. `` As a citizen, I feel very indignant.'' `` That's right,'' said onlookers. `` To tell you the truth, we were forced to come,'' said an 18-year-old high school student. <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, a county official who organized the rally, said the demonstration was to `` oppose turmoil'' created by a `` small group of people'' for political goals. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> officials informed some foreign journalists Tuesday of the Daxing march and two others in suburban <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Nationwide TV broadcast a brief segment of one of the marches during the evening news. Large banners bearing slogans opposing `` bourgeois liberalization'' and capitalism over socialism appeared on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> hotels on Wednesday. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and a handful of other intellectuals were purged from the party in the anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign of 1987, which began after the last round of student-led protests for democracy. But diplomatic and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources say a meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the purge of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been postponed because the leadership remains divided. Sources say at least 200,000 military troops called to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to enforce martial law also are pawns in the power struggle going on at the top levels. Tens of thousands of citizens mobilized to block troops from entering <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law. The march through central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Wednesday night was much smaller than other pro-democracy demonstrations of the past few weeks, highlighting the difficulties faced by the students to keep their movement alive despite continued government pressure. The government maintained a media blitz condemning the occupation of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where about 10,000 students live in squatter camps to press their demands.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials called off the search for 14 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> missing after their helicopter crashed in the ocean off <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, and all are presumed dead, a spokesman for American forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said Thursday. However, the Japanese coast guard continued its search for survivors Thursday morning, replacing three boats that searched overnight with seven boats and two aircraft, said spokesman <PERSON> Toshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawabata </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman, Marine Master Sgt. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>, said American efforts were called off Wednesday night. Eight other Marines aboard the helicopter were rescued after the CH-46 Sea Knight, based at <LOCATION> Kaneohe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, crashed just before midnight Tuesday soon after taking off from the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in an amphibious training exercise.

<HEAD>Chile's Military Goverment, Opposition Agree on Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lame-duck military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Wednesday said his government and the opposition have agreed on democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s constitution, including replacing a ban on Marxism. In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, the 73-year-old president and army commander called the accord `` an expression of the national will to find the best ways to achieve the full democracy we all want.'' Hours before <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, spokesman for a 17-party opposition coalition, said the parties gave `` a green light'' to the changes drafted by the government for the 8-year-old constitution written by the military. The agreement came after two months of unprecedented negotiations between the 15-year-old right-wing military government and its foes. The negotiations put <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> face-to-face with Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, and leaders of two pro-government conservative parties also took part. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> came to power in a military coup in 1973 that toppled the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is scheduled to hand over power on March 11, 1990, to the winner of an election set for Dec. 14. He had to call the election after his bid to extend his term until 1997 was overwhelmingly rejected by voters in a referendum in October. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> is considered the most likely opposition candidate in the election. Full details of the proposed changes were not immediately disclosed, but <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said they include replacing a controversial article banning Marxism with another that `` ensures in a better way a responsible political pluralism.'' The government also agreed to the opposition's demand to change the make-up of the future <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he said. It had offered to increase the number of elected senators from 36 to 38, diluting the influence of nine appointed senators. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said the government did not accept all the reforms sought by the opposition `` but there was some clear progress.'' The government submit the proposed changes to the four-man military junta. Junta approval is considered certain, as is approval in a subsequent national referendum expected in August. Another article strongly opposed by the opposition establishes a military-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> empowered to `` represent'' its views on key matters to future civilian governments. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said that clause would also be amended but did not elaborate. The government indicated earlier it is prepared to add another civilian member. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said the opposition will continue to push for changes that lead to `` an authentically democratic regime.'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a socialist opposition leader, said, `` This is a first step, and a step that is positive for the country.''

<HEAD>Dallas County Commisssion: New Color, Old Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The color of its leadership has changed after more than a century of white domination but the hub of the civil rights movement still is shackled, like much of rural <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, by the irons of a stagnant economy. In the county where voting rights history was made in 1965, one out of nine workers is looking for a job. The new majority black commission pledges that everyone, no matter their race, has reason to hope for better times. But signs of old racial animosities still flare, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner D.L. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, a 78-year-old black farmer, offers a word of caution: `` Nearly 25 years have passed, but there are many elderly people, and people who are not so elderly, brought up to feel inferior. That's a carryover from the plantation days. Once we bypass that, we'll be able to move forward.'' It's been 11 years since the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sued to force <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to abandon an at-large system of electing the county commission, a system civil rights advocates say ensured the election of whites. Blacks comprise 55 percent of the county's 50,000 residents but less than 45 percent of registered voters The county fought the lawsuit, proposing its own district election plan that would have called for four districts _ two predominately black, two mostly white _ and a commission chairman elected by all county voters. `` It was fair,'' said Probate Judge <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who by virtue of his office served as president of the commission under the at-large system. `` The plan the commission devised was extremely fair.'' Meanwhile, black leaders, including <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, devised an opposing plan calling for three black districts and two white districts with the commissioners choosing their chairman. The plan finally was approved in the federal courts last year, leading to elections that sent <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> to the county courthouse. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> admits his sprawling district is `` quite challenging,'' but defends the arrangement as fair to everyone. `` I feel it is as just a plan as we could come up with. Blacks are in greater numbers as far as population is concerned, and we had to address the districts accordingly.'' The three were sworn in Jan. 16, the first blacks to serve on the panel since the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controlled the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> after the Civil War. The new commissioners promised to end what they saw as long-standing favoritism toward whites, but not everyone agrees that their early actions have been colorblind. One of their first acts was to remove the longtime license commissioner, who was white, and replace her with a black woman. In addition, former commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> of ordering the paving of driveways owned by blacks while ignoring those of whites, a critical issue in a mostly rural county where rain turns many roads into quagmires. `` I would like to see every road in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> updated and paved wherever possible,'' <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said. `` But do them all alike. Do n't pick out certain roads. Whites got preference in the past. The maps indicate that.'' The dispute led <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> to claim that <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> had threatened his life and <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, who denied it, to claim that he in turn had received threats. The new commissioners also found the same basic problems that plagued previous commissions and other counties in the depressed Black Belt, an area named for its rich, black soil but filled with poor, modestly educated or illiterate people, most of them black. `` Basically, we're just trying to fulfill our major obligations and barely meet our payroll,'' said Minor, a county employee for more than 12 years until his election to the commission. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, who was replaced by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, understands the new commission's dilemma. `` We never had any extra money. The only thing the county commission can do is spend money frugally.'' Twenty-four years ago, <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> became forever linked with the struggle for racial equality when voting rights marchers were beaten on the <LOCATION> Edmund </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pettus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> by club-wielding police at the start of a march to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. Two weeks later, the marchers were back _ under federal protection and with the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ to cross the bridge and complete their march into history. A few months later, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the Voting Rights Act. Since those turbulent times, both blacks and whites agree that <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have made racial gains, at least politically. But Minor says true equality wo n't be a reality until blacks share in the county's limited wealth. `` I have not seen much economic gain for the black community. My son is graduating from high school this year, and he plans to go to college next year. When he graduates in four years, there will be nothing for him to come back to in this area. I do n't see any opportunity for jobs.'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate stands at 11.3 percent, more than twice the nation's average and significantly higher than the state's 7.3 percent. `` The birth of the movement began here,'' Minor said, `` but other counties are enjoying the fruits of our labor.'' Adds Pope: `` I do n't know of anyone in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> or this country who is looking for more than his percentage of the pie. We ca n't continue to see whites get all the better jobs.''

<HEAD>Catholic Educational Chiefs Ask Bush To Clarify School Stand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Chieftains of Roman Catholic education are pressing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to clear up _ publicly _ whether he wants parents allowed to put some of their taxes into schooling they choose for their children. That, essentially, would be the effect of tuition tax credits for parents of pupils in church and other non-public schools. It's a longtime explosive political issue on which the `` education president,'' as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he aspires to be, has become subtly enmeshed and on which <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators want straight answers. `` We assume a meeting with him is going to come through,'' says Sister <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're still waiting.'' She and other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educational leaders, plus ll archbishops who co-signed a letter from Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, have asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a meeting June 9 to clarify his position. He indicated support for tuition tax credits in his campaign. But a comment last March 29 `` gave the impression he's no longer interested in it,'' Sister <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We're still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' she said, but want him to set the record straight, in a public way. <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, in his letter signed by other prelates, suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a debt to Catholics since, because of his campaign commitments, `` Catholics played a significant role in your successful election bid.'' `` The question of parental choice in education is a vital and crucial issue in our nation today,'' he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and church educators want him to `` clarify misconceptions and to address questions or misgivings you might have.'' In his March comments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` intrigued with the concept of tuition tax credits'' but that it is `` the obligation of all taxpayers to support a public education system.'' He said parents of non-public school students have a right `` to shell out, in addition to the tax money, tuition money but that they should not get a break for that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary subsequently qualified the comments, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not shifted his commitments, but current budget contstraints prevent considering tuition tax credits. Despite the elaborations, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments have `` cast a shadow of confusion on our previous perceptions,'' says Sister <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, vice president of educational administrators of the NEA. In her letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, jointly signed by other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education officials and school superintendents in major cities, she said the meeting is needed to dispel confusion. `` We are not asking you or the federal government to subsidize our religion,'' she said. `` We do not want that. `` We do believe firmly that parents have a constitutional right to choose the educational milieu for their children without penalty'' and `` to benefit directly from their educational tax dollars.'' Catholicism's vast educational enterprise, serving 7.6 million students at all levels, includes 9,000 elementary and secondary schools. Most of them, especially in urban areas, enroll both Catholics and children of varied religions. Many are too poor to pay, but tuitions of those who can and supplementary contributions pay the multibillion dollar costs. `` Parents should be able to choose the kind of education and schools they want for their children,'' Sister <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, but many now ca n't because it `` means paying double'' _ school taxes and tuition. `` Many families now do not have a real choice in schools for their children because they ca n't afford that double burden.'' The suggested June 9 meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ proposed two weeks ago with no direct reply yet _ was suggested because administrators of the `` Big l0'' Catholic schools systems are meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at that time. Sister <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, also director of educational services in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> besides her post with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> education administrators, said in the joint letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` As <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> educators, we have struggled to maintain a viable presence in the heart of our urban centers to give the poorest in our land a real option, a genuine choice for their children of an education that is God-centered and which has a moral component to it. `` Parents want this choice but are often unable to exercise it for financial reasons.'' Noting that the 2,700 schools in ll major urban dioceses enroll a million children at a cost of $ 1.4 billion annually, she says this saves the country $ 2 billion annually since per-pupil costs in public schools range from $ 4, l00 to $ 6,900 per year. Citing remarks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the govenment can not afford to help parents of children in non-public schools, she said: `` We strongly disagree. We believe, faced with the present national crisis in education, that you can not afford not to help.''

 The recently merged <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ended its first fiscal year with a deficit of $ 15.8 million _ spending $ 104.3 million but with income of only $ 88.5 million. Bishop <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON>, head of the 5 million-member denomination, says the situation requires `` some painful adjustments in the coming months,'' but the `` long-range picture for the church is good.'' He says members apparently have increased giving at the local level but cut back in giving to the churchwide organization on the assumption it was `` doing all right.'' Among steps being taken to deal with the problem are a freeze on staff enlargements, limiting salary boosts to a maximum of 2.5 percent and reducing the number of persons traveling to regional events. The deficit is being covered by reserves and proceeds from sale of property, mainly former headquarters of the three merging denominations before locating here.

 <PERSON> Hildegard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> took the right precautions. Mrs. <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, 77, who used a metal walker, enlisted the aid of her friend <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Selden </PERSON>, 80, in crossing busy <LOCATION> Beachwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> on Oct. 27. At 7:55 p.m., it was dark, and difficult for the drivers of cars speeding through the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to see people on the street. No doubt, the women waited a while before stepping off the curb. When they did they were hit, police say, by a car driven by a 40-year-old schoolteacher who sped off as the women were thrown to the pavement. Both died. The deaths reignited a debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> about crosswalks _ now being eliminated by the hundreds in a citywide repaving project. Neighborhood residents set up a shrine at the intersection and demanded signals and crosswalk markings. But traffic engineers decided white lines on the pavement would n't offer a solution. Instead, they installed stop signs. Experts agree that in some cases, having no crosswalk actually is safer than having the painted lines on the street. Studies show that markings often increase a pedestrian's chance of being hit _ especially at intersections with no lights or signs _ because of a false sense of security. `` The feeling that you're safe in that crosswalk is definitely a facade,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Shur </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. ` It's just one-sixteenth of an inch of raised white paint on the pavement.'' A 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> report found marked crosswalks usually were safer than unmarked ones, but studies of markings at intersections uncontrolled by lights or signs found just the opposite. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 42 of the 157 pedestrians killed in 1988 were struck in marked crosswalks compared to 23 in unmarked crossings. The majority of the dead were jaywalking. In <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a study of 10 years of accidents found eight times as many pedestrian-involved collisions at marked crosswalks as unmarked crossings. A 1970 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> study of 400 marked and unmarked intersections, all without signals, found twice as many pedestrians were struck in marked crosswalks as in unmarked, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Herms </PERSON>, author of the study. `` The evidence seemed to indicate that pedestrians tended to be more trusting in the marked crosswalks, trusted the motorist to see,'' said <PERSON> Herms </PERSON>. `` But the motorist said, ` The first I knew the pedestrian was there was when I heard the bump on the car.''' His advice: `` Do n't rely upon the painted lines to stop the automobile.'' According to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranck </PERSON>, head of the pedestrian safety program for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the trouble is that `` many cities have put in crosswalks where they should n't have been in the first place,'' primarily for political reasons. The painted lines have done nothing to halt injury and death at the intersection of Eighth and <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> streets in the <LOCATION> Boyle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where residents have demanded a traffic light. In the twilight of Nov. 28, 9-year-old <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was struck by a car and killed as the driver rushed to work. On Jan. 6, two 14-year-old girls walking to school were hit by a car and injured. Cities such as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have begun removing crosswalks at such uncontrolled intersections to increase safety. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> has removed 700 crosswalks since 1970; <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> has eliminated 700 since 1975. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has wiped away more than 200 and plans to delete up to 300 more. <PERSON> Herms </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, pedestrian deaths in the six years before the deletions were 157; from 1971 to 1976, 117 pedestrians were killed. Nationwide, one in six people killed in a traffic accident is a pedestrian. About 8,500 died in 1987, the most recent year counted. `` Pedestrians really are the forgotten stepchild in traffic safety,'' <PERSON> Ranck </PERSON> said. `` Especially in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Retting </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s deputy assistant commissioner for safety, `` everyone's in a rush and ... they're just not thinking for that moment. Authorities eventually caught the woman they say was driving the car that struck Mrs. <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> and her friend. <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Buocz </PERSON> pleaded innocent to hit-and-run driving and awaits trial. Police Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said it appears Ms. <PERSON> Buocz </PERSON> was not speeding, but simply did n't see the women. Experts agree that the pedestrian usually is at fault. `` The majority of pedestrians killed in traffic violated a traffic law or committed an obviously unsafe act,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. No one may ever know who was at fault in the deaths of Mrs. <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Selden </PERSON>. But police believe the elderly women took care. `` The lesson is, when you cross the street _ make sure that the cars are stopping,'' said <PERSON> Shur </PERSON>. `` Regardless of who is right or wrong, the pedestrian always comes out last ... and they usually come out dead last.''

 Is the prime-time soap opera, one of television's most popular formats, an endangered species _ or is it just changing form? <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> canceled `` Dynasty'' after nine years. CBS renewed `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Knots Landing'' and `` Falcon Crest,'' but the luster is gone. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Knots Landing'' barely made it into the top 30 highest-rated shows the past season. No new prime-time soap is on the horizon. The last effort was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Year in the Life'' two seasons ago. But the form has evolved into something else. The foremost exponent of the new format is <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' It's not as outrageous as `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' It's not as melodramatic as `` Knots Landing.'' But the essential elements are there: a strong dramatic narrative, ongoing stories and evolving characters. Other shows in this new format are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething'' and `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Wiseguy'' and `` Tour of Duty.'' `` I do n't know the difference anymore between the so-called soap operas and ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law' and ` Wiseguy,' except the story arcs are shorter,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, the creator of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Knots Landing.'' `` I think that the fading of the other shows, other than ` Knots Landing,' is just that they're old and old shows tend to fade.'' <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, who created `` Dynasty,'' declined to comment, but has said in the past she thinks the prime-time soap opera has undergone a metamorphosis into such shows as `` L.A. Law'' and `` thirtysomething.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said `` thirtysomething'' reminds him of the early years of `` Knots Landing'' when it `` was a little softer and more self-conscious.'' He said `` Knots Landing'' evolved into a melodrama because it needed more excitement to hold the audience. CBS' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' was the highest-rated show for three seasons and second for two others. The `` Who Shot J.R.'' episode in 1980 broke all viewing records up to that time. In the 1984-85 season, when the soaps reached their peak, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dynasty'' ranked first and `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' was second CBS' `` Knots Landing'' and `` Falcon Crest'' were 9th and 10th for the year. The granddaddy of the prime-time soap opera was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Peyton Place,'' which ran twice, and sometimes three times, a week between 1964 and'69. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> followed it with `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' ` The Survivors','' an ill-conceived show that lasted only briefly in 1969. Other failed efforts: CBS' `` Sons and Daughters'' in 1974, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Beacon Hill'' in 1975, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Executive Suite'' in 1976, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` W.E.B.'' in 1978. The current cycle of shows began with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Rich Man, Poor Man _ Book II,'' which ran for one season after the `` Rich Man, Poor Man'' miniseries. `` I certainly had that in my head when I did ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,''' said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. `` The continuing saga seemed a reasonable thing to develop for television.'' After `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' in 1979, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> launched `` Knots Landing'' the following year. CBS' `` Falcon Crest'' began in 1982. Numerous other soaps were attempted: CBS' `` Secrets of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Flamingo Road,'' CBS' `` Emerald Point, <ORGANIZATION> N.A.S. </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` For Love and Honor,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Call To Glory,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Berringer's,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Yellow Rose,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Gangster Chronicles,'' CBS' `` Hometown,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Year in the Life'' and even <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Crime Story. Prior to the soaps and serials, each episode of a series started from scratch. The characters never learned anything from the previous week's experience. `` I think shows like ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law' and ` Knots Landing' are the future of network television,'' said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. `` We ca n't compete with what's on cable. We ca n't do nudity. If you're doing an action-adventure you ca n't compete with ` Rambo.' The one thing network television can offer is a continuing drama and an involvement with characters who change. You ca n't go back to shows where the characters never changed or learned anything.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said serials are difficult to launch because they demand such an investment from the audience. `` You are there not only to watch this week but next week and the week after that,'' he said. `` That's why serials have never worked on Saturday night. People ca n't make the commitment. The biggest mistake some producers have made is beginning a show as a serial. You have to win the audience first. ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' and ` Knots Landing' did n't begin as serials.'' Although <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has pulled the plug on `` Dynasty'' as a weekly series, that may not be the end of <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> and the others. The network is considering a two-hour movie for next season to wrap up the loose ends and solve the cliffhanger that ended its nine years on the air.

<HEAD>Getting Good Mileage From Travelers Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As they get ready for summer getaways in the weeks ahead, many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> vacationers will be stocking up on swimming suits, suntan lotion _ and travelers checks Despite the advent of the credit card and bank teller machine networks, reported sales of travelers checks keep rising steadily, 98 years after an employee of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Marcellus </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> hit on the idea. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which remains the best-known travelers check purveyor, says its worldwide sales of the checks increased from $ 13.8 billion in 1983 to $ 21.1 billion last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, says its sales of checks to credit unions jumped more than 50 percent in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> CUNA </ORGANIZATION> attributes this growth to a booming travel and vacation market at just about all age levels of the population, from the youngest of the baby boomers to the rapidly growing ranks of older Americans. The appeal of travelers checks, of course, is that they serve as a kind of marked money _ nearly as handy as cash, but protected, unlike cash, from the hazards of theft or loss. In fact, says the CUNA, less than 1 percent of the travelers' checks that are issued become the subject of refund claims Nevertheless, if you are going to take the trouble of getting them for the protection they offer, financial advisers say, it makes sense to handle them properly and wisely. First of all, they suggest, familiarize yourself beforehand with the procedure for obtaining a refund in the places you plan to visit. Then, you need a plan for safe, separate storage during the trip of the documents that show what checks you have bought and their serial numbers. Among the travel safety tips it offers, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> recommends drawing up in duplicate a list of the travelers checks you will be carrying, along with numbers of such other things as credit cards, passports and insurance policies. `` Keep one copy with you and leave the other at home with a friend or business associate,'' the company says. `` It will speed replacement or recovery in case of theft or loss.'' `` Each time you cash a traveler's check, write down the amount and number of the check, the place you cashed it and the time and date,'' it adds. That way, you will know at any time the amounts and numbers of checks that still may be lost or stolen. All this may sound like a lot of trouble to take, more than a lot of people would actually bother with. After all, you are going on a vacation, not to an accounting convention. But the whole idea of travelers checks is security, against loss of your money and against the disruption of your trip. Few institutions that sell travelers checks charge onerous fees for them. If you're inclined to shop around, however, you may well find a place where they are available more cheaply. At the end of a trip, it makes sense to cash in any remaining checks quickly to put the money to use elsewhere. A few years back, one firm suggested in its advertising that you keep one or two unused checks in your wallet more or less permanently as a sort of emergency reserve. Whether that appeals to you or not, you should bear in mind that the suggestion does not come from a disinterested source. Companies that make travelers checks profit from the `` float,'' earning investment returns on your money between the time you buy a travelers check and the time you spend it. So hanging on to an old travelers check is pretty much the same thing as putting it into a savings account that pays no interest at all.

 A key producer of an evangelical declaration stressing conversion of Jews says it was aimed mainly at some fellow Christians and not at Jews whom it has keenly offended. They're incensed by it. So are some Christians. They say it's contrary to developing Jewish-Christian reciprocity As the conflict smouldered, the chairman of the panel that produced the document, the Rev. Vernon Grounds of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> -RRB- Seminary, said it was directed at an `` in-house issue'' among the churches. `` A movement is gaining ground that repduiates the New Testament mandate and says it's not necessary to evangelize the Jewish people,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` More and more, this position is coming to the fore. We feel it imperative to reaffirm the historic Christian position that the gospel be preached to the Jew first.'' The declaration asserts that Jews can be saved only by accepting Christ. This contrasts with a developing, historic rapprochement between Judaism and Christianity as both bound to God. That evolving concord, expressed lately in official statements of a growing list of mainline denominations, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has marked a watershed in religious annals. It comes after centuries of Christian demeaning of Jews. `` A major shift has occured among mainline Protestant churches and Roman Catholics, but it's not without some challenges and pain,'' said retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Episcopal Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Marqwuette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who chaired development of a new <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> stance toward <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, said the trend `` has triggered some backlash.'' Some of that backlash was indicated in the evangelical declaration, drawn up by 15 scholars in April and since endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION>, which estimates its global adherents at 100 million. `` Some church leaders have retreated from embracing the task of evangelizing Jews,'' maintaining that `` God's covenant with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' is sufficient for all times, the declaration says in its preamble. However, it says the biblical status of Jews as `` God's people'' can not save them without accepting <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and that God's covenant with Jews was conditioned `` upon the fore-ordained sacrifice'' of Christ. While the declaration repudiates past persecutions of Jews and condemns anti-Semitism, the declaration describes `` evangelizing of Jewish people as a priority,'' and discounts dialogue without that purpose. The `` biblical hope for Jewish people centers on their being restored through faith in Christ to their proper place as branches of God's olive tree from which they are at present broken off,'' the declaration says. Jewish leaders voiced outrage. Rabbi <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregations </ORGANIZATION>, called the declaration `` retrograde and primitive. `` It is a desperate attempt to stop the clock of progress in interrlegious relations. Jews have no interest in dialogue with those who feel that they alone are worthy of God's grace.'' Rabbi <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON>, interrelgious affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the document is `` shot through with the ancient Christian ` teaching of contempt' for Jews and <LOCATION> Judiasm </LOCATION>.'' He said if the declaration's objective of converting Jews were totally successful it `` would mean the end of Jewish life throughout the world,'' amounting to `` spiritual genocide.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Galin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiestand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION>, said it had realized that making the declaration `` would not be a popular thing to do. `` But we had no alternative other that to affirm <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as the promised messiah and acceptance of him as the only basis for salvation.'' Many noted theologians and actions by several denomination, the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- USA -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, have underscored the continuing validity of God's covenant with Jews. The Rev. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> specialist on Christian-Jewish ties and long-time head of the religion department at <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, termed the change in church attitudes `` a revolution.'' ` It's the wave of the future, a very solid thing, so different from what has gone on for centuries,'' he said. `` The other point of view is simply wrong and centuries of church history does n't make it right. He said the deepended New Testament understanding is that God's covenant with the Jews was opened `` to the Gentiles'' through Christ `` It's not a denial of roots but a rediscovery of roots.'' He said the `` other side'' is `` not really being faithful to Scripture,'' but does have `` a little bit of partial truth'' _ that `` Christians must not close the church doors to Jews or anyone. The doors must always be open.'' Grounds, a conservative Baptist who led production of the new evangelical declaration, said `` we hope it will be wholesome rather than divisive in its outcome.'' `` Christianity is rooted in the Old Testament, and we are grateful for the Jewish Scripture,'' he said. But the Jewish covenant with God no longer applies, he said. `` Judaism is no longer a redemptive religion.''

 Faith still brings martyrdom for many Christians, says a noted missions researcher. The Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, editor of the World Christian Encyclopedia, estimates an average of 325,000 Christians have been killed for the faith each year over the last quarter century. `` There's nothing unusual about this,'' he says. `` It's gone on for 20 centuries. It's simply a part of the life of the church.'' He says his estimates are based not only on news accounts, but on data that often emerge years after the incidents. Also, he counts as martyrs believers who lose their lives because of human hostility, often political. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a British Anglican now serving the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, estimates 40 million Christians have been martyred since the time of Christ. But the church knows the names of only 15,000 martyrs, he says. As for the rest, `` nobody wrote their story down. Their names are lost.''

Among steps being taken to deal with the problem are a freeze on staff enlargements, limiting salary boosts to a maximum of 2.5 percent and reducing the number of persons traveling to regional events. The deficit is being covered by reserves and proceeds from sale of property, mainly former headquarters of the three merging denominations before locating here.

 After years of toil, and following two heart operations, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> has a new way of working: He smacks golf balls and reads until his doorbell rings. If his partner in a production company, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchow </PERSON>, is waiting outside, he knows it's time to dust off his actor's cap. `` I say, ` Go ahead, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, work. And pretty soon it gets to the point where he has to get me in on it, and suddenly I'm working again and do n't realize it,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> says. But slowing down was n't easy for the 61-year-old <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, who was once described as `` the last real man'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He might be 6-foot-3 and robust, but his body has been telling him to ease up for many years. He was twice wounded during the Korean War, and was awarded the Purple Heart each time. In his first year on the hit TV series `` The Rockford Files,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> ripped up his knee. Always ready for an encore, he did it again the next year. He's also broken his tail bone and his ribs, and injured tendons and ligaments. Add to that ulcers, arthritis, disintegrating disks in his back and occasional bouts of depression. But the stakes escalated last year when he was hospitalized because of a weakness in the aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart. He underwent a bypass operation and surgery on the aorta. `` It was n't very good news,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> recalled, wryly. The operations slowed him down a little bit and `` made me smell the roses a little more, I guess,'' he says. Now, he's happiest when he's making a birdie on the golf course, or when he's home quietly reading. `` Happiness for me is relief from stress,'' the actor said. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> gave up tobacco after 45 years, and plays with beads to keep his hands busy and away from cigarettes. But stopping smoking was n't easy for an actor who first appeared on television in commercials, promising that `` Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.'' `` That's the way I did it, and a year later they did a whole ad campaign to cross ` like' out and put ` as' in its place,'' he recalled with a chuckle, although he's not sure whether it was wrong in the script or if he made it wrong. However, the star of TV's `` The Rockford Files'' and `` Maverick'' and dozens of movies including `` The Americanization of <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>,'' `` The Great Escape'' and `` Victor-Victoria,'' still occasionally cheats and lights up. `` I would love to have one every few minutes but that's out of the question,'' he confessed. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duchow </PERSON> have produced two television specials: `` My Name Is Bill W,'' the story of the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, which was broadcast last month; and `` Promise,'' the 1986-87 Emmy award-winning story of a brother whose carefree lifestyle is threatened when he is forced to care for his mentally ill brother. `` I like stories that have to do with the human condition. But I'm not a crusader,'' said <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1986 as best actor for his performance in the movie, `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Romance.'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, the youngest of Mildred and <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumgarner </PERSON>'s three sons. His father was a carpetlayer. His mother died when he was young. He quit school at age 16 to join the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in 1944 and dropped in and out of high schools as he roamed the country for several years, shaking off the shyness that resulted from years of berating by an overbearing stepmother. At age 17, he worked at a Hollywood gas station and got to know <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who became a successful producer. Eight years later, after a year at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> and working for his father's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> business, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> drove by `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and Associates'' and decided to see if <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> had been serious years earlier when he told him he should become an actor. He said he saw a parking space in front of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s building. `` If that space had n't been there, I would never have driven around the block to look for one,'' he once said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> hired him for the stage production of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Caine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutiny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martial </ORGANIZATION>,'' and <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> worked his way from a non-speaking role as a juror to a leading role on tour. He married actress <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> 32 years ago. They raised two daughters, one of whom became an elementary school teacher and the other a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> country singer. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> cherishes traits he traces to his maternal grandfather, a Cherokee Indian: `` Stoicism, stubborn, you bet. Dogged, trustworthy, like a Boy Scout.'' `` I think I have a lot of the old West values of ` your word is your bond,' honesty and that sort of thing that does n't seem to hold much value anymore to people,'' he said. He's been cited as an example of a man with values because he has resisted the pitfalls of the `` me generation'' and its companion attitude of, `` I'm going to get mine no matter who I step on.'' `` I come from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> where we're still kind of simple folks,'' he said. `` I have to live with my own conscience. When I go to bed at night and my conscience does n't keep me awake, I've lived by my rules, whatever they may be.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Fifty years ago on June 6, a group of neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a scaled-down field in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. They called it the Little League. Today more than 2.5 million young boys and girls play on 140,000 Little League baseball teams in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 33 foreign countries. But despite its immense popularity, the organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the Little League turned out.

 When you drive south on Route 15 in north-central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, just as you top the crest of <ORGANIZATION> Bald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> pull over and cast your gaze on the valley below. If there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of Little League baseball, you are looking at it. The <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> winds down from the green <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> hills through a town of 40,000 souls who live in clapboard houses with porch swings and shade trees, a timeless scene off a postcard labeled `` America.'' An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag large enough to cover a small infield draws your eye to the north bank of the river. It flies proudly in front of a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields, the international headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this year Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6, 1939, have grandchildren playing in the league. A Little League ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities, villages and suburbs across the land. A three-team league of 30 <ORGANIZATION> Williamsport </ORGANIZATION> boys in 1939 was the seedbed for what <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today calls the largest sports organization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on 140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 33 foreign countries. `` Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,'' says <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, who founded the league while working as a clerk in a lumber yard. `` All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhood program. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.'' At 79, <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> still lives in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>. He is a man with an incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save receipts. He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for the first Little League season came to $ 174.63, that the collection taken up at the first game netted $ 1.42, that the first boy-sized catcher's mask, ordered from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and which he still has, cost $ 1.67, the first dozen balls $ 2. The first year's deficit was $ 36.72, which <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> made up out of his own pocket as he did every year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black. Now Little League, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has assets of more than $ 10 million and a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters. It charges each of those 140,000 teams a charter fee of $ 14 each year and earns millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the Little League name, which is copyrighted, and the logo, which <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> designed. The business of Little League is unquestionably big league. <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s memory of how it all began is vivid. One August day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two nephews, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehron </PERSON>, ages 6 and 8, in his back yard at 1108 <LOCATION> Isabella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Running </LOCATION> backward, he tripped over the jagged stumps of a cut-down lilac <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and bruised his ankle. His left ankle. `` I sat on the back steps there,'' he recalls, pointing, `` rubbing my ankle. `` I said to the boys, ` How would you like to play on a regular team with uniforms, a new ball for every game and bats you can really swing?' `` One of them said, ` Uncle Tuck' _ that's what they called me _ ` who would we play?' `` I decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams.'' <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and went to a flat field at Memorial Park where picknickers played softball.

 <LOCATION> WILLIAMSPORT </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>: played softball. Through the winter <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> worked out the details, rules, age limits and the like, which have remained essentially unchanged. He called on 57 merchants before he found the first sponsor, <ORGANIZATION> Lycoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION>. The next spring Little League was born. `` When <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> passed out the uniforms, the day before the first game, it was one of the proudest days of my life,'' recalls <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>, who now lives in nearby <LOCATION> Montoursville </LOCATION>, hit .462 that year to become Little League's first batting champion. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> began as a Little League umpire in 1941 and, at 78, is still at it, conducting the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s umpiring school in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> `` I've seen some ugly things when the parents get too excited,'' he says. `` The kids walk off the field arm-in-arm, but I know of mothers who would' t speak to each other for a month Little League has had its share of critics over the years, but its very prosperity indicates to supporters that its benefits clearly outweigh its flaws. Most parents who have sat on wooden benches on a lazy summer afternoon and watched their own and their neighbors' kids enjoy the national pastime, however ineptly, conclude that Little League ca n't be all bad. One of Little League's least vocal but most severe critics is, sadly, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> himself. `` I have absolutely no animosity toward anyone working for the corporation,'' he says. `` Many of them are my dearest friends. But what Little League is now is not what I envisioned it to be and I do not approve.'' <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> feels that commercialization has blurred the neighborhood focus of the program which he saw as its heart and its purpose. His critics say he was behind the times, a naive innocent who did n't realize Little League's potential. His supporters say, as did one <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> father, `` All my kid wants to do is play in the World Series. All I want him to do is play baseball and have fun.'' Because of these and other philosophical and administrative differences <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> was eased out of the Little League in 1955. He took with him, however, his Original Little League. It is not affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Original Little League has thrived in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> in the 34 years since <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s ouster About 150 children, including about 25 girls, play on 12 teams in three age groups. The field the `` Originals'' play on is the same one <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> used to rearrange newspapers and figure out the proper distance between bases for kids. The field has been improved over the years by volunteers. It has a fence and scoreboard and dugouts and clubhouse and grandstands. On May 4, 1974 the city of <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> formally dedicated that field on Memorial Park to its honored citizen and put up a sign: The <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> Field. So Uncle Tuck still has that. Another honor came to <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> on Oct. 8, 1988. The Original Little League threw a testimonial dinner to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Last year. `` Our first season was in 1939,'' says <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, his penchant for accuracy unremitting. `` So we celebrated our 10th anniversary at the end of the 1948 season, not 1949. Count it up. Use your fingers. `` In 1948 I put out a 25-page 6-by-9 booklet with pictures of all the boys. It brought in, let's see here, $ 200.59 in contributions in excess of printing costs. This year's 50th anniversary of their <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> is a year late. In <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s back yard is a garage-size building which he built himself to preserve what he calls `` my display. If you drop by, he will show you the first Little League bat. You will see snapshots of the first three Little League teams, no different in composition than today's Polaroids that decorate refrigerators across the land. Speaking of roots, you will also find in <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s display the brittle remains of the lilac bush that tripped him up in his back yard and set him to dream of a better way, a dream that became Little League. `` That lilac stump? Well,'' says <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, `` after a couple of years I went and looked and discovered it was still there. So I dug it up. `` Yeah, I guess that's one thing I saved on purpose.''

 The Chief swept into the hospital lobby, handing his hat, coat and books to the waiting crowd, dispensing a cheery greeting and a wave of his hand. He led them past the outstretched arms of the 10-foot marble Christ and down the long corridor to the first ward. Gathering at a bed, spectators focused their attention on the patient. And on The Chief. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Osler </PERSON>, a showman with high forehead and the bold mustache of a pirate, was in his element. He was teaching medical students at the bedside. And he was making history. For this was <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> around the turn of the century. And <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> was among a small group of physicians who were helping change the way <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trained its doctors. With the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical school in 1893, <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> and his colleagues became the first American medical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students. They also put a new emphasis on research and on learning by experience. `` From the outset, <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> embodied a conception of medical education as a field of graduate study, rooted in basic science and hospital medicine, that was eventually to govern all institutions in the country,'' wrote sociologist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, `` The Social Transformation of American Medicine.'' This month marks 100 years of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. The Hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medical education. In the past century, researchers there developed the radical mastectomy for breast cancer, built the first renal dialysis apparatus, crystallized insulin and made many other key contributions. The Hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had some good medical schools, but also many poor ones, medical historian <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in a recent interview. No national standards yet governed medical education. Schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics where students could get some training with patients. Most schools could not offer much bedside experience. In general, American medical schools also lacked laboratory facilities and conducted only limited original research. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, by contrast, was leading a scientific transformation of medicine that began in the mid-19th century, fueled by advances in microscopy, chemistry and physiology. The Hopkins trustees had some major advantages. Rather than battling entrenched dogma and professors they could start from scratch. And rather than having to persuade a hospital to let students into wards, they could make the hospital a teaching tool from the beginning. When it came to opening the medical school, however, they also had a big problem. As trustees of the estate of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment in American history. The $ 7 million <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> left upon his death in 1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university. But even as the hospital opened its doors in 1889, the financial prospects for opening the medical school were shaky. Income from the railroad stock that made up the university endowment had dried up. Four wealthy, well-educated daughters of the trustees offered to raise the needed money, provided the school would admit women on equal terms as men. The trustees agreed. But by December 1892, the women had raised less than half the $ 500,000 the school needed. Other medical schools, knowing of the delay, were trying to lure the Hopkins medical faculty away. Finally, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, a member of the women's committee, offered to donate the balance _ for a price. The school would have to admit only students who had a bachelor's degree, and a reading knowledge of French and German. The trustees, swallowing hard at requirements they feared might drive away many prospective students, accepted. `` It is lucky that we got in as professors,'' <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> told a fellow faculty member. `` We could never enter as students.'' It was a relief when 18 students, including three women, showed up to form the first class.

 The medical curriculum <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> provided was marked not so much by innovation, as by a combination of features that had appeared in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and scattered American schools. It was an ambitious enterprise, even apart from requiring a college degree for entry. Few other schools provided well-equipped laboratories in basic science for teachers and students. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> aimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on of existing knowledge. The idea was `` to give the world men who can not only sail by the old charts, but who can make new and better ones for the use of others,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON>, a Civil War battlefield surgeon who became a key architect of the medical school curriculum. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> also made a policy of learning by doing, both in the laboratory and in the hospital. With <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> as their mentor at the bedside, students took medical histories of patients, performed physical examinations, conducted routine laboratory tests and followed their patients' course. As <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> put it, `` the student began with the patient, continued with the patient, ended his studies with the patient, using books and lectures as tools, means to an end.'' The school made full-time jobs out of teaching basic science, rather than using local physicians to teach part time, as most other schools did. The full-time idea, later extended to instructors of medical practice, allowed <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> to go outside the local community to lure top-notch faculty members. Eventually, the school also offered lengthy training in medical specialties to its students who had finished the four years of the regular curriculum. The result of all this was such that in 1901, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> congratulated <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> on a `` prodigious advancement of medical teaching.'' The men who led the way were the Big Four. One was <PERSON> Osler </PERSON>, who had come from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to become professor of medicine at the school and physician-in-chief at the hospital. The author of a classic medical text, <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> became one of the nation's most highly regarded physicians. Joining him was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsted </PERSON>, a shy and excrutiatingly meticulous surgeon. He became well-known for such innovations as the radical mastectomy for breast cancer, and his training of other surgeons. Then there was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, a genial, rotund pathology professor who became a power behind reforms in medical education and stimulated interest in medical philanthropy. Finally there was <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the gynecological surgeon, who developed and improved that art. He `` took pleasure in quick, flashy operating,'' one student wrote later. `` He'd be in and out of the abdomen almost before you knew it, all the time talking and illustrating what he was doing or about to do.'' Of the 17 original hospital buildings, only three remain, hemmed in by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medical school. The scene today at <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> would astonish the Big Four. Faint rock music nudges the quiet of a white-walled laboratory as <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON>, 39, holds up a dark gray sheet of X-ray film. It shows several series of smudged black lines. During the days of the Big Four, physicians were just beginning to understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells. Now, the smudged lines on <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON>'s film are helping to explain those abnormalities. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON>, 67, arose shortly after 5 a.m. one recent day at his <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> home. He drank some coffee, read the paper, picked up a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small tape recorder. It was time to catalog a new human gene. When the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical school was founded, the idea of genes was not yet generally accepted, for the work of Austrian monk <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> in the 1860s was not yet widely known. Today, <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON> maintains a list of human genes, accessible by computer around the world. The entry he dictated before breakfast that morning was number 4,584. But while medicine has advanced greatly since <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> began, some things stay the same, notes <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical historian <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. A committee that reviewed the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical curriculum recently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing, and of not only teaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creating new knowledge, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` It's a process of rediscovery,'' he said with a smile. `` They rediscovered all the principles that were here when the place started.''

 The unusual story behind the founding of <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is captured in the Latin words engraved in stone above the columns on its classical facade: `` Deo et Patriae Pietas <PERSON> Christiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Erexit </PERSON>.'' Or, as even the most plodding of Latin scholars who ever trod the corridors of this reknowned Jesuit high school might translate: `` Built by Christian piety for God and country.'' Seventy-five years after a rich widow anonymously gave her pastor $ 500,000 to build a free school for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> boys, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> is still giving full scholarships to every student it admits. It draws the cream of the academic crop, mainly from parochial grammar schools in the five boroughs of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the surrounding three-state suburbs and sometimes even farther afield. `` Everyone thinks I'm crazy to come into the city,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzetti </PERSON>, 14, a freshman who spends three hours a day traveling back and forth from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> For <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Taveras </PERSON>, 17, a senior who chose <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> over the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, the trip to school is a 30-minute subway ride from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. `` I love it here,'' <PERSON> Taveras </PERSON> says. `` When you come from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, it's really challenging to grow up in a different kind of world. This school is a meeting ground for people from so many different backgrounds.'' Today's 501 Regis students are getting their free education _ valued by school officials at over $ 24,000 _ thanks not only to the generosity of the original benefactor and her family who over the years gave millions to keep the school running, but its 7,500 alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in their own right. About half the $ 3.3 million budget comes from interest on the school's investments. The rest is raised each year from alumni, foundations and other sources. `` Each year the costs go up at least $ 200,000,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, <PERSON> S.J. </PERSON>, the president since 1980. `` That's not going to end.' But while other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools struggle with rising tuitions and contracting enrollments, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> has been able to pour $ 5 million in recent years into expanding science labs and other major renovations of its building on East 84th Street, two blocks from Central Park. The top faculty salaries will hover near $ 40,000 this fall. Last year's seniors scored an average of 1,273 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 369 points above the national average. Many graduates attend select colleges, including 84 who went on to <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> colleges in the past four years alone. More than a third of the students come from families with incomes below $ 30,000 a year, and 40 percent are the children of immigrants from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and three dozen other countries. The school, largely white for decades, now has a 28 percent minority enrollment, including 60 Hispanic students -LRB- 12 percent -RRB-, 51 Asian -LRB- 10 percent -RRB- and 28 black -LRB- 6 percent -RRB-. Unlike many parochial schools, especially in big cities, it does not admit non-Catholics. Each fall, on the first Saturday in November, about 900 students take a standardized admissions test. Students also are judged on their elementary school grades, activities and, for the finalists, an interview before the 130 scholarship winners are chosen shortly before Christmas. Most of those admitted score in the top 5 percent on standardized tests _ a common cutoff for the gifted.

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION>: for the gifted. The Rev. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the headmaster, will be succeeded as headmaster this summer by the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuntz </PERSON>, who has been headmaster of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Prep in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuntz </PERSON>, a 1966 <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> graduate, will be only the second alumnus ever to run the school. The school's two top administrators are two of only a dozen Jesuits left on the 50-member staff. A quarter-century ago, more than half the faculty were Jesuit priests or `` scholastics'' _ young Jesuits halfway through the 13-year preparation process leading to ordination. Not a few of them were alumni. In fact, a Regis yearbook marking the 50th anniversary in 1964 noted that almost 10 percent of its alumni were priests. But few Regians opt for the priesthood these days. Many of the Jesuits on the faculty are nearing retirement, and their replacements are not in sight. It has only one scholastic this semester `` and we're not sure we'll get a replacement when he leaves,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the assistant headmaster Other things have changed at the school. There was a time, says <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakinship </PERSON>, chairman of the science department, when a Regis student was just a student. `` Now he's taking care of the younger brothers and sisters, cooking the meals, doing the wash while the mother works. In my advanced placement physics class, two-thirds of the guys had jobs.'' No longer do students flunk out in droves in the sort of educational triage that once characterized many Jesuit schools. Latin, long the backbone of the curriculum, became optional four years ago. While that raised the hackles of some alumni, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> says, `` we're trying to get needy students in here. We're bringing in kids who very often are the first people in their family to complete high school. They know no reason to study Latin.'' While it is no longer producing legions of priests, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> does inculcate in its students the value of community service. Seniors are required to spend Tuesday mornings out as volunteer tutors in grammar schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods, or working in hospitals or nursing homes. Most seniors are freed from all classes during the last trimester to devote full time to such pursuits, or to work on job internships. Its alumni include several university presidents, including <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> -LRB- p942 -RRB- of <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> -LRB- 948 -RRB- of <LOCATION> Fordham </LOCATION>, as well as banking executives, corporate chieftains and judges _ although rival <ORGANIZATION> Xavier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> boasts <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. The alumni rolls are also thick with lawyers who first honed their oratorical skills in the classrooms of <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> and its <ORGANIZATION> Hearn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a perennial state debating champion. `` We still produce more lawyers than anything else,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> says. `` If you teach here for a while you understand that it is not an accident. Our kids love to argue.'' But the school's best-known graduate is Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, the AIDS researcher and director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases whom President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called one of his personal heroes. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, a 1958 graduate, remembers fondly his four years commuting as a straphanger from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to the upper <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where he encountered `` an academic excellence that really was unmatched in all of the educational experiences I've had since then.'' <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> is now run by a board that includes both lay and Jesuit members. Its leaders say it will retain that Jesuit character, even as the numbers of priests on its staff dwindle. <PERSON> Mazzetti </PERSON>, the freshman from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, said his parents have been pleasantly surprised at how few demands the school makes for money to pay for extracurriculars or anything else. `` At my old school, they always asked for money for every little thing,'' he says. But an older student who overheard the remark chimed in knowingly, `` Never being asked for money? Give me a break. Wait until you graduate.'' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> is a 1967 graduate of <PERSON> Regis </PERSON>.

 Outdoorsman and writer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>, a conservationist with a sense of humor, is still spouting the one-liners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers. `` I prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work,'' the 78-year-old <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> likes to say. And: _ `` Fishermen are born honest, but they get over it.'' _ `` Some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of string with a worm on one end and a damn fool on the other. This is a silly definition, of course, for many fishermen use flies instead of worms.'' _ `` Fish is brain food. People who eat fish have large, well-developed brains. People with large, well-developed brains do n't fish. It's that simple.'' Beneath the mischievous grin, however, is a serious concern about what could lie ahead unless Americans start paying more attention to the world around them. `` Thirty-five years ago, we did n't have waste products of nuclear plants,'' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> says. `` We did n't have a lot of the poisons that are poisoning the atmosphere. We did n't know that spray cans could destroy our ozone layer.'' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> never imagined things would become as bad as they have. `` I thought something would be done about it, measures would be taken,'' he says. `` Unfortunately, it did n't work out that way.'' The bearded, hoary-headed author of the `` Exit Laughing'' column in <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stream magazine, occasionally mistaken in the past for another avid outdoorsman, the late <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, is doing what he can to increase public awareness. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology entitled `` Hunting and Fishing from A to <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>.'' He also is creator of the more-or-less imaginary Madison Avenue <PERSON> Rod </PERSON>, Gun, <ORGANIZATION> Bloody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labrador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retriever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose motto is `` Keep your powder, your trout flies and your martinis dry.'' `` It's implicit in everything he does, the respect for the outdoors, the love for it,'' says <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stream's managing editor That zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards program <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> founded in 1954 with corporate backing. His aim was, and still is, to give conservation-conscious folks `` a slap on the back.'' His Chevron Conservation Awards Program, believed to be the oldest privately supported program of its kind in the country, has recognized 663 individuals and 101 organizations over the years. The 1989 finalists were honored May 17 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C. Each year, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> helps whittle down the list of up to 150 nominees. Some of them, he acknowledges, fit the stereotypical image of the conservationist. `` Little old lady in tennis shoes? They exist and they're charming people, usually,'' he says, chuckling His all-time favorite finalist is a 70-year-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> game warden who was honored in the late'50s. The man's wife, who nominated her husband for the award, thanked <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> profusely following the ceremony. `` This little old lady came up to me and said, ` Mr. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>, I want to thank you for being involved in this and to tell you what a wonderful thing it was for me,''' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> says. `` I said, ` Well, I should think it would be wonderful to have all these people here to honor your husband.' `` She looked sort of surprised. She said, ` Oh, no, it is n't that We've been married 52 years and this is the first time we've ever stayed at a hotel.'

 <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>: at a hotel. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>'s passion for the outdoors was nurtured by his father, who headed <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> during the 1910s. The elder <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> often took his young son on inspection trips. `` I would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream,'' he recalls. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> caught his first trout at age 5. The next year, his family moved from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area. Since then, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> has fished and hunted on five continents. Occasionally, sometimes by accident and sometimes not, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> repeats himself in his `` Exit Laughing'' column, which he began in 1958. It never goes unnoticed. `` I always get three or four letters and I have the same answer to all of them,'' he says. `` I say, ` Dear Mr. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, Thank you for your letter of such and such a date. The last time I heard the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>, they played the <ORGANIZATION> Brahms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> and I understand they've done it several times before. Sincerely yours.''' So just where does he get his ideas? `` I wish I had one,'' he says. `` I've got a piece due the day after tomorrow. It was a lot easier when I was younger and smart-aleckier than I am now.'' He also suffers now from Parkinson's disease, which causes his hands to tremble and consequently prevents him from shifting from a manual typewriter to an electric typewriter or computer. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> is at his home in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, only about half the time. The rest of the time he's on the road. His favorite sport, and writing topic, is fishing. Like many serious anglers, he tosses his catch back into the water. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> does n't feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated. `` I'm rather glad everybody does n't like fishing or the good fishing places would be so overpopulated,'' he says. `` So I'd never knowingly write anything that would encourage anybody to go fishing. You can always build more bowling alleys or tennis courts. You ca n't build more trout streams.'' His sentiments are shared by his program's awardees. Among the 11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, couple who have developed a school curriculum on marine and wetlands resources, and a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> man who has led a campaign to establish a national park in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. Ten professional conservationists also received $ 1,000 and a bronze plaque, including a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who is working to save the threatened Piping Plover, a shore bird. The five group finalists included the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which is rehabilitating local waterways so fish can migrate upstream. The 30 to 40 students are raising money for a new hatchery to replace one that failed to meet earthquake standards. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> says he has no real way of knowing whether the awards program or any of his other efforts have had, or will have, a significant effect. `` We do n't really know how many souls are saved,'' he says, `` no matter how tough the sermon.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ One of the managers of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> bar, himself a recovering alcoholic, decided adults needed a place to go to dance and party without being exposed to booze, like the non-alcoholic clubs for teen-agers. So one night a week the <ORGANIZATION> Night </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VIP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION> becomes Club Soda, where the drinks are no stronger than the name implies.

 The dance music pulses through the art deco nightclub with its mirrored walls as bartenders hurriedly stir, shake and blend exotic drinks. The adult crowd at Club Soda is partying this Friday night, but they are all sober. There is no alcohol in the drinks. `` It's a major nightclub. It has everything but the booze,'' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON>, one of the managers of <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soda </ORGANIZATION>, a Friday night non-alcoholic alternative for adults who want to party without getting drunk. `` There are people out there that just ca n't drink and they have nowhere to go.'' There are many nightclubs offering dancing and a club ambiance without alcohol for teen-agers, but a boozeless bar for adults is unusual, says <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON>'s partner, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlay </PERSON>. `` We could pack them in with kids, but at the same time, that's not what we were looking for,'' Rowlay says Except for Friday nights, <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soda </ORGANIZATION> is actually the Night Life <ORGANIZATION> VIP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION>, a full-service bar. And the decision to ban booze each Friday night, typically a busy night for bars, was something personal for <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON>, a recovering alcoholic. `` I'm recovering and I've met through my past two years out there a different breed of people that enjoy life without the sauce,'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. `` I'm just tired of reading, ` Just say no to drugs and say no to booze.' You've got to do something. Anybody can say that; it's time we show people how to live. I feel real good about it.'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> credits Night Life owners <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarpa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> DeStazio </PERSON>, his employers for a number of years, with giving him the chance to try the no-booze bar. It's an idea that Night Life beverage manager <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szmajlo </PERSON> endorses. `` You've got people that maybe should n't be drinking, that do n't want to drink and are off the sauce, who want to come out and have that same atmosphere, a party night, and not get drunk,'' <PERSON> Szmajlo </PERSON> says The Club Soda drink menu runs the gamut from the ever-popular <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON>, ginger ale with a dash of grenadine, to more exotic items such as the Lemon Spritzer, <PERSON> Pineburst </PERSON> and a host of frozen coladas, as well a mineral water, cappuccino and expresso coffees. `` The help has been very supportive of this and it's tough to find bartenders that will work without getting the tips that they're accustomed to in a real bar,'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. The club, which opened Feb. 27, averages 130 to 150 people a night, <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. Most non-drinkers are discovering the club by word-of-mouth although the club purchased a few ads in the local newspaper. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Killiany </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, heard about the club in an alcoholism recovery program in which she participates. `` I do n't miss not having drinks, not at all,'' she says. `` I like it here a lot. The mirrors and the non-alcoholic drink. Hang around, you'll see, it's a gas. It's worth the drive.'' There is a doorman at Club Soda, not to check ID's but to check for boozers and potential troublemakers. The doorman does not admit anyone who has been drinking. `` Some people may come in for a goof, but that's on them,'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. `` They're the ones who paid the five bucks to come in and walk right out.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's something of a cross between `` <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>'s Believe It or Not'' and `` 60 Minutes,'' which may have inspired its name Soviet television's rapid-fire news show `` 600 Seconds,'' which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the establishment, has become immensely popular since it went on the air. Before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power, such a program would have been unthinkable in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A lost bull roams a busy city street. Prostitutes woo foreign customers. A holiday bombing rips off a man's legs. These and other eye-opening images are flashing across Soviet television screens as glasnost, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for openness, goes video Traditionally, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has used state-run television as it did other media _ to reach the masses with propaganda, rather than programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just plain fun. The airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on subjects such as the grain harvest. The leadership still commands unlimited time. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a more lively TV personality than his predecessors, and frequently turns to television to make speeches and broadcast his street-side talks with people. For the first time this winter, parliamentary candidates debated each other on television. Western music videos are shown routinely, `` space bridges'' bring the uncensored views of Western studio audiences into Soviet living rooms, and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives Soviets a glimpse of Western lifestyles. One trailblazing program, which featured the offbeat stories about the bull, the prostitutes and the bombing, is `` 600 Seconds,'' a fast-paced live show on <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> television that has become a smash hit since its premiere in December 1987. Six days a week, 15 million people in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other regions can switch on their TV sets to catch up on the latest sensations from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. `` 600 Seconds'' is like a cross between `` <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>'s Believe It or Not'' and `` 60 Minutes.'' Leningraders have nicknamed the show, `` Our City Scandal-Monger.'' At 10 p.m., a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes of news reports read live by a studio announcer, and videotaped reports presented rapid-fire in a down-to-earth style. A digital clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the remaining seconds. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON>'s irreverence surfaces in every broadcast. He relishes stirring up the town with what he calls `` sensations.'' The program consists largely of crime reports, but also has a heavy dose of the bizarre, such as a story about the city's dirtiest toilet. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON>, the show's co-creator and main anchor, races around this city of 4.9 million people all day to gather material for his Monday-through-Saturday broadcast, relying heavily on tips from the public and police. He has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go along with such status in the West _ no secretary, no private office, no chauffeur-driven limousine and a salary of only $ 475 a month. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON> is a former horse trainer and TV scriptwriter, and bristles when the word journalist is mentioned. Most Soviet journalists, he said, could not come up with the stories he does, and he does n't agree with the Western notion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalize the news. The public turns to `` 600 Seconds'' to fight the Soviet bureaucracy. On one recent afternoon, a caller asked the program to prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his apartment window. `` 600 Seconds'' and other <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> TV programs have helped lift the veil from subjects such as homelessness, rape, prostitution, murder and robbery, and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject, privileges of the Soviet elite. But there are still forbidden themes. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON>'s boss, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurkov </PERSON>, said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who is fighting to reform Soviet TV, said reforms can be difficult. `` I also have my bosses. We have our minister. He has his deputies ... And it is not always possible to overcome psychologically these traditions.''

 While much of Soviet television is looking more Western, the man who reads the news to millions every night prefers to do things the old-fashioned way. `` Hello, comrades,'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> says as he peers through thick bifocals to begin Vremya, the nightly news on state-controlled television. He has uttered those same words since Vremya first went on the air on Jan. 1, 1968, and became a main news source for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 285 million people. While other Soviet TV programs and the press are tapping glasnost, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, to air sensations about crime, history, or life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> has remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago. When the superpowers agreed last March that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would travel to the country he had called an `` evil empire,'' a major announcement worldwide, Soviets had to sit through two hours of a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> speech about farming and a story about domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from <LOCATION> Vremya </LOCATION>, which is Russian for time. Vremya still dwells on long-winded reports about the Soviet economy, often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and therefore dubbed `` tractor news.'' And in static pictures that make Western producers cringe, cameras often fix on <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> and other announcers reading lengthy government statements. Vremya has its high points, however. When an earthquake killed thousands on Dec. 7 in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, Vremya aired a dramatic report from the scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks. <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON>, 57, read the news during the `` period of stagnation,'' the conservative rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, and has continued through the glasnost years. Interviewed in Vremya's tiny studio, <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> compared the program, then and now. `` Earlier it was good,'' he said through gritted teeth, indicating some discomfort with that evaluation. Switching to his full baritone voice, he added: `` Now it is also good.'' Other TV programs borrow the style of American broadcasts. <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> concedes he watches the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, but says he is sticking to his old-fashioned, formal style. A new man in charge of Vremya described the ideal anchorman. `` He should be a little bit of a journalist, a little bit of an actor, a little bit of a politician,'' says <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Producers are spicing up Vremya with graphics, foreign video plucked off communications satellites, and shorter, more interesting and timely reports. <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON> says Vremya lags behind other programs because it was born before glasnost, when `` there was a big difference between politics and real life,'' and `` because it has much official and government information.''

 <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON>'s earlier work for the producers of `` Empty Nest'' almost prevented her from getting a role in the new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy. The show, about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenly finds himself living alone, was created by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who also created `` Soap'' and `` The Golden Girls.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, the self-absorbed daughter of the pediatrician, played by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, and sister of a policewoman, played by <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> <PERSON> McNichol </PERSON>. `` They auditioned hundreds of actresses,'' she says. `` Everybody I knew went in for that role. They could n't find what they were looking for.'' It would seem that <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> would have had an edge because she had played <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefkowitz </PERSON> in `` Soap'' for the producers, <PERSON> Witt-Thomas-Harris </PERSON>. But, she says, `` They did n't think I was right for the part at first because of the work I'd done in ` Soap.' The characters were different. They did n't want the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Jewish, fast-talking, tough Mafia princess I played in ` Soap.' I'd played the same kind of character in the movie ` I Ought To Be in Pictures.' `` So I asked to read. When I read I made sure that none of that was showing. And they saw it and cast me.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> says she has `` a real affinity'' for the writing of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` I understand her rhythm,'' she says. `` I understand her language.'' She disagrees with descriptions of <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> as neurotic. `` She's just terribly self-involved,'' she says `` Everything has to revolve around her. If there's a disaster somewhere, her only thought is how does it affect her. She regularly takes her emotional temperature.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> grew up in a show business family. Her mother is actress-director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and her stepfather is producer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Feury </PERSON>. Last summer she worked in `` Boy's Life,'' a movie made on location in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> directed by her mother and produced by her stepfather. `` It was very interesting,'' she says. `` It was kind of like being 14 and told to clean up your room. That's the downside. The upside is that she and I are very close friends and very admiring of each other as actresses and artists.'' She'd worked for her mother once before, on a TV movie called `` A Matter of Sex.'' The movie, which also starred <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, was about sexual discrimination in the workplace. She did n't begin acting until she was 19 because her mother did n't want her to be a child actor. She was a college film student briefly, then quit to pursue her acting career. <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> studied at the Actor's Studio and made her professional debut in a production for <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> called `` The Great Cherub Knitwear Strike.'' Next, she did a small role on the TV series `` Welcome Back, Kotter.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> won a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> in 1980 for her Broadway role in `` I Ought To Be In Pictures.'' She reprised her role in the movie version. Her only other series was `` Soap,'' on which she played the daughter of a gangster and the wife of <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wass </PERSON> -RRB-. Her film `` Child's Play'' is just out and `` Bloodhounds of Broadway'' is due in September. Another movie, a thriller called `` Backfire,'' is coming up on Showtime. She is starting a new movie called `` Welcome Home, <PERSON> Roxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>,'' which also stars <ORGANIZATION> Winona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>.

 On one side of the stage stand the Jets, on the other side the <ORGANIZATION> Sharks </ORGANIZATION>. The rival gangs from `` West Side Story'' huddle around microphones and watch conductor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemignani </PERSON> on a small podium in the middle of a vast wood-paneled room filled with musicians. It's a Sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' are in <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>' Studio A on West 44th Street. The singers look at <PERSON> Gemignani </PERSON>. The conducter, wearing headphones, glances at a man standing over a control panel in a soundproof booth near the stage. Take after take is recorded until <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON> is satisfied. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, an RCA Records producer, is the man who must capture the sound of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' a celebration of some of the biggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer. Besides a suite of dances from `` West Side Story,'' the show includes numbers from `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' `` The King and I,'' `` Gypsy,'' `` Peter Pan'' and others. The final result, released in May on two records or two cassettes or two compact discs, is one of the most lavish original cast recordings ever made. It includes more than 120 minutes of music and a 62-page booklet with extensive notes on each of the musicals included in the show. `` Cast albums are very demanding,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, who has been in the recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast album guru <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. `` They require a great deal of advance preparation and a lot of study. If you're going to record the <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> ` Seventh Symphony,' you do n't have to sit there in advance and decide whether you're going to take it up a key or whether you're going to leave out the third movement. `` But in the case of a Broadway show, you have a theatrical work that's designed for the stage,'' he says, `` and how does it translate to a record when you have nothing to go by except what you're hearing? Frequently you have to change the reality of what is happening musically to re-create more accurately the memory in the listener.'' Before the taping sessions, <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> was n't sure how `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' would work on record. It presented special problems. `` Most of this music is familiar, and most of it has been recorded before,'' he recalls. `` For example, you do n't want to have just another recording of ` West Side Story.' Plus there's a lot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show. So what do you do with it?'' <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> decided to record not just the music, but the feel of the stage production. He brought in the cast to tape a lot of what he calls `` crowd material,'' not just the singing. In the past, most Broadway musicals were recorded in one day, usually the company's day off. Some still are, but `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' took three days, spread over two weeks, to complete. For one reason, it was twice as long as a regular cast recording. It has a large cast _ 62 performers _ and a large orchestra _ 42 musicians plus two players added for the `` Fiddler on the Roof'' segment. For another, technical advances have allowed for more material to be placed on a record, tape or compact disc. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> jumped to RCA in 1974 when <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> did. He also became a producer of classical recordings, supervising albums by such orchestras as the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> conducted by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON>. But he also assisted <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> on some of the best cast recordings ever made, including `` Sunday in the Park with <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>.''

 The 1988 Tony Awards show was the lowest-rated <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> program ever, and the prospects do n't appear much brighter for the 1989 extravaganza -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT Sunday, CBS-TV -RRB- saluting the best of what has been a woeful Broadway theater season. But even last year's program, which was ranked No. 42 in the Nielsen ratings for that week, was seen in an estimated 9.5 million homes. Those viewers would fill a lot of Broadway theaters, a fact not lost on the Tony nominating committee. All seven productions nominated this year for best play or best musical are still running. And Tony Awards sell tickets. `` M. Butterfly,'' last season's best-play winner, started to sell out after it won the top award Also-rans such as `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone'' and `` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' quickly folded. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mischer </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who produce the Tony television show, are optimistic about this year's edition, which will be televised live from the Lunt-Fontanne Theater. `` You always hope for a strong season,'' <PERSON> Mischer </PERSON> says. `` The biggest thing you work for in this show is to try and keep the television viewer familiar with what is happening on Broadway so that when awards are given, they have some idea who the people are and what the plays and musicals are about. If you have a really popular season, that helps you a bit.'' For the third straight year, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> will serve as host for the show which will feature scenes or dance numbers from the best-play and musical nominees. Among the stars scheduled to appear are <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. But the suspense should be minimal. `` The <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronicles </PERSON>,'' which has won every honor from the Pulitzer Prize to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Drama Critics' Circle award, is a clear favorite to be tapped as best play. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>'s look at one woman's journey from the 1960s to the present faces `` Largely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>'s wordless entertainment; `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' a farce by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> about an indisposed opera star; and `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s portrait of a bored but never boring English housewife There's even less uncertainty about the winner in the top musical category. The season produced one hot ticket _ `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' _ and it should easily ace the best musical category. The telecast will feature a dance number from `` West Side Story,'' the high point of the Robbins show. Only two other shows _ `` Black and Blue'' and `` Starmites'' _ were nominated for best musical. The television presentation will also feature two songs from `` Black and Blue,'' a revue of blues songs and tap dancing, and a campy, <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler-style </PERSON> number, `` Hard to Be Diva,'' from `` Starmites,'' a sci-fi, comic strip musical. `` With the Emmys, Grammys and Oscars, the nation is basically familiar with those TV shows, records and films nominated,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> says. `` Here, it is more difficult. That's one of the reasons we are presenting segments from the plays and musicals. We are trying to make the show more relevant for them. So if <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> wins, for example, they have seen him and what he won for.'' Broadway had a bumpy year. Although it grossed a record $ 262 million, attendance declined slightly from 8.1 million to 8 million, and the number of productions slipped to 30, down two from the previous season. The biggest hits were still two long-running shows, `` The Phantom of the Opera'' and `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' and others such as `` Cats'' and `` Me and My Girl'' show no sign of closing soon. Even those big hits could n't guarantee high ratings for previous <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> shows. <PERSON> Mischer </PERSON> is philosophic about the gradual ratings slide for the program over the years. `` The Tonys still do better than the average variety show on television,'' he says. `` If you look back on the variety shows over the last two or three years, the ratings have simply gone down and down and down. We're living in an age of hyperactive television watching. We sit there with a clicker in our hand, go through 38 channels and dare something to hold our interest for five seconds. `` That works against variety television. It works against things that are different. If there is one act you do n't like, one song you do n't like or one speech you feel is too boring, you're apt to move on. And all of that affects the ratings.''

 Sales of new homes were up a strong 10.9 percent in April, the government reported, but housing economists say the industry will remain sluggish at least into summer because of high interest rates. The increase in sales to 620,000 units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis reported Tuesday was due to an aberration in sales in February and March, when sales dropped 10.9 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively, economists said. The April increase was the steepest since a 13.9 percent jump in February 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has elected a new president, but the technology-minded executive is not in line to be chairman of the world's largest computer company because he is older than the current officeholder. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON>, the new president, is 56. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive, is 54. The new job for <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON> is a recognition of his contributions in a 31-year career at the company, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Judice </PERSON> said Tuesday in announcing <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON>'s promotion. <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON>'s duties at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, headquarters will be about the same as they were in his former job of vice chairman, although he will have slightly more authority, <PERSON> Judice </PERSON> said. The vice chairmanship will be left vacant for now. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has no mandatory retirement age, but top executives make a practice of relinquishing their jobs at age 60. That gives <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> potentially six more years as chairman. <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON>'s predecessor as president was <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> himself. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> became president in February 1983, added the title of chief executive in February 1985 and added the chairmanship in June 1986 at the unusually young age of 51. As vice chairman, <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON>'s job under the bylaws was to assist the chairman. As president, the bylaws state that he is to run the business, after the chairman, and can act for the chairman. `` It's a somewhat more substantive position,'' Judice said. <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON> is known within <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> as a technology expert, in contrast to <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, whose main strength is in marketing. <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON> began with the company as an associate engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in 1958. He was elected to the board of directors in 1986 and executive vice president in March 1987. He was named <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman of the board in January 1988 and given responsibility for overseeing <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the organization headed by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenbach </PERSON> that is responsible for all <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as worldwide development.

 The president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Matilda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Ms. and Sassy magazines, has resigned from the privately-held concern she helped found a year ago, the company announced. Sources close to the company said Tuesday that the publishing concern was looking for someone who may be willing to invest in Matilda Publications. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> resigned Friday and left the staff a memo in which she said she was leaving to `` begin work on other publishing projects.'' `` I leave confident of the future prospects of Sassy and Ms. magazines, both of which are doing well and continue to flourish,'' she wrote. A call was placed to Ms. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, but she was said to be unavailable to elaborate on her reasons for leaving. The board of <ORGANIZATION> Matilda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Graubard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON>'s chief operating officer, as acting chief executive until a successor to Ms. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> is found. Ms. <PERSON> Graubard </PERSON> did not return a telephone call. The board also said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of Ms., will assume editorial responsibility for both Sassy and Ms. Ms. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, who was Ms. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>' partner in getting <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> started last June, said she would not speculate about her partner's reasons for leaving Ms. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said the company was `` in the process of doing a refinancing'' and has for been looking for `` a couple of months'' at the possibility of bringing in `` a new partner who has some publishing experience.'' She declined to say what conditions led to the search, but said it would be incorrect to say that the company had been placed on the auction block. <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON>'s current financial backers include <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>.

Sassy had a circulation of about 437,000 at the end of 1988, while Ms. has a circulation of about 550,000, Ms. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Experts are evaluating an extra-light type of crude oil recently discovered in at least three fields in southeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to determine if it is profitable for marketing, according to a source at the state petroleum monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>. The new Toltec crude is at least 40 degrees on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s gravity scale _ the lightest found so far in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said the source, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity. It was discovered at the beginning of the year at `` great depth'' in the Juju, Tecominuacan, <PERSON> Paredon </PERSON> and other onshore fields that lie between the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Coatzacoalcos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Villahermosa </LOCATION>, the capital of Tabasco state. `` We are still making studies of the characteristics of this crude. We are taking a series of samples and analyzing them to see what characteristics they have, their yield and what -LRB- production -RRB- problems are involved,'' the source added, refusing to say more. The Toltec is even lighter than the Olmec variety, measuring 38 to 39 degrees, discovered by <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> last year in the state of Tabasco and <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION> states and now being exported in small quanitities. One of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s two other traditional varieties, the Isthmus measures 33 API and the heavy Maya 22. The Olmec has been found to contain very little sulphur and metals. Lighter crude is easier to refine.

 <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has started to evaluate buyout offers, including bids by billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said they met <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday afternoon deadline for submitting acquisition proposals, but declined to outline specifics of their bids Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, would not disclose who the suitors were or how many proposals it received. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed up $ 1.25 at $ 107.25 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> oil and real estate mogul made an offer but retained a limited right to pursue his outstanding hostile tender offer of $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. The tender offer was scheduled to expire this afternoon, but likely would be extended, <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON> declined to provide details of the latest <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offer, which was submitted to <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> said none of the bidders or bids would be disclosed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> indicated earlier Tuesday that it had obtained $ 2.7 billion in bank financing for a buyout plan that it submitted by the deadline, but declined to disclose terms of the bid. The proposal also includes at least $ 400 million in new equity financing from a group that includes <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the partnership <ORGANIZATION> Airlie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>. Other potential bidders that have expressed interest in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> included an investment group led by former <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000-member machinists union, which has indicated it might team with an outside investor to buy a major stake in the airline; and the Wall Street buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> did not return phone calls Tuesday and a <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the firm would not <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, also did not return calls seeking to determine if the union had submitted a buyout plan. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> has directed four of its outside directors to review all offers, but Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> repeatedly has said the board could ultimately decide not to sell. Possible alternatives for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> include acquisition of another company, a partial or complete liquidation of the airline, a repurchase of shares, payment of a special dividend, or the sale of a bid stake to a `` white squire'' group that would obtain a controlling interest but would support current management. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, has said it would like to make a decision in the takeover battle by the end of June. The <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board has pushed for a single round of bidding, but analysts said the process could start over if a higher bid arrives after the deadline. Cooperation from <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s unions is considered crucial to the bid by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. Industry analysts have been cautious about <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s prospects because of that company's $ 900 million in debt, $ 535 million in outstanding pension liabilities and continuing operating losses. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> told investors last week that should his bid for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> succeed, he plans no sales of operating assets and no sale or lease-back of planes. <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> also has said he was not counting on any revenue from a sale of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s real estate in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but would save $ 240 million by streamlining the new carrier's corporate headquarters, marketing operation, maintenance and other support services.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced supercomputing equipment that an executive said would `` compete very favorably against the other manufacturers of supercomputers in the world.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> offers equipment and software that can be added onto its most powerful mainframe computers so they function as supercomputers. Although <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is considered the world's leading supercomputer manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has actually sold more units when its souped-up mainframes are counted. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> developed the new offerings in cooperation with partners including <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarosh </PERSON>, director of scientific and technical computing marketing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jarosh </PERSON> declined Tuesday to specify the peak speed of the systems so no direct comparison is possible with machines made by <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> and other supercomputer makers. Prices will be announced in 60 days and installations will begin no later than the last quarter of 1989. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s most powerful mainframe computer is the ES-3090 Model 600, which has six processors. New hardware and software will allow customers to hook two of those machines together so a job can be run across as many as 12 processors at once. Also announced was a communications channel that can transfer data at 800 million bits a second. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it was the first channel to meet a draft standard established by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> outlined new corporate strategies at its annual stockholders meeting, but the company's successful defense against a hostile takeover was mentioned only briefly The topic of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s hard-fought battle to repel a $ 3.1 billion bid by investor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, made through his <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, came up when a shareholder asked a nominal question about it Tuesday, officials said. The meeting instead focused on new marketing, product development and manufacturing strategies by the company, based in nearby <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. Polaroid President <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> told the group of about 1,200 stockholders at <ORGANIZATION> Wellesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> that the company in 1988 re-evaluated `` its technology, its marketplace, its organization and its behavior, making a rapid, quantifiable leap forward in profitability.'' `` We are in the midst of a major turnaround in this company, and because of the progress we have made, I have confidence that this turnaround will continue,'' said <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the company is aiming for a 50 percent increase in the growing imaging field by 1995. Imaging refers to the storage of pictures or documents through electronic means, as opposed to photographic means. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankowski </PERSON>, vice-president of marketing, said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> will develop new market-driven technologies, especially in imaging. <PERSON> Yankowski </PERSON> said dealer and consumer response to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s new conventional `` OneFilm'' has been favorable.

<HEAD>Eastern Runs First TV Ad Since Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an effort to persuade consumers it is reliable, punctual and run by experienced workers, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has started advertising on television for the first time since the start of a bruising strike. Eastern recently began running the commercial in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, at a cost of more than $ 500,000. The beleaguered airline already had been advertising in major newspapers. `` We're trying to build awareness and provide some information,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. In recent weeks, Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been promoting its new plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell about $ 1.8 billion of assets. The plan still must be approved by federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection and reorganization shortly after the March 4 strike began. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has given <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> permission to sell its Northeast shuttle service to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million and to lease 14 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200s to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 57.9 million over three years. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been defending his plan in meetings with media organizations such as <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, The Associated Press and NBC News. Eastern's unions, on the other hand, are pushing for a sale of the entire airline. Of the 31,200 pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members and flight attendants employed by Eastern before the strike, only a few have crossed picket lines. The airline has hired about 500 new pilots and 60 skilled mechanics. Eastern's operations have been sharply reduced by the strike and it has run only about 10 percent of its normal flight schedule. The TV ad does n't mention the strike or bankruptcy filing. It features a pilot who has flown for Eastern for 31 years and a 21-year maintenance manager speaking to the camera while seated at a desk. The words `` Experience,'' `` Commitment'' and `` On-Time Performance'' flash at intervals. The maintenance manager, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, emphasizes what he calls the cooperative attitude and `` esprit de corps'' of Eastern workers. The pilot, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, says that more than 5,000 Eastern flights have arrived on time since April 1. `` We've got a brand new <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> with a bunch of old pros,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> says. `` We're taking off'' is flashed on the screen. The average age of newly hired pilots is 39 years, up sharply from the pre-strike average of pilots in their late 20s, according to the company. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the commercial was made in about six hours with no script and no rehearsing. `` I think most employees would have given anything to be in my place,'' he said in a phone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I think the message we wanted to say got across.'' Striking pilots disagreed. `` It's sad to see these lost sheep supporting <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a union spokesman. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the ad agency <PERSON> Scali </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sloves </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced it had won the ad contract for the Trump Shuttle. Advertising for Eastern's shuttle had been handled by <ORGANIZATION> Lintas </ORGANIZATION>, which does ads for the rest of the airline.

<HEAD>Study: Insurers Must Consider Cost-Effectiveness Of New Medical Technologies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Faced with spiraling medical costs, insurers must begin weighing not only the health benefits of new medical technologies but their costs and whether improved care justifies the added expense, says a study by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest health maintenance organization. `` Cost is a legitimate consideration in making coverage decisions,'' said a report issued Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even when it is established that a new, more expensive therapy is better than the existing alternatives, one must question whether the added benefit is worth the added cost.'' The report said that without a framework to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of technologies, decisions on what should be covered by insurance will be `` put off until time of crisis -LRB- and then -RRB- are more likely to be influenced by emotions or political expedience than by medical efficacy.'' `` Not only might underserving technologies be approved, but the most deserving technologies may be overlooked,'' the report said. The study said new technologies must first be investigated to see if they represent an improvement in health care. The study pointed to rapid adoption of tissue plasminogen activator, a genetically engineered drug for dissolving blood clots that cause heart attacks. The report said it remained unclear whether the drug, at $ 2,000 per dose, is any more effective than Streptokinase, a competing drug, at $ 200 a dose. The report, based on the findings of a three-year study by a special commission appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, also suggested that older procedures be periodically evaluated. `` It was once thought that the minimal dangers of circumcision were far outweighed by health benefits to the child, and so the practice was commonly covered by insurers. Recent findings have led many in the medical community to question whether the procedure provides any health benefit,'' the commission said. But beyond comparing the effectiveness of various technologies, insurers also should weigh the relative worth of new technologies that are proven to be more effective. Insurers should `` avoid treatments that cost far more than any benefits they might bring about are worth,'' the study said. `` Few, if any, health plans now acknowledge considering cost in their coverage decisions. The result is that cost effectiveness is rarely analyzed in any rigorous way, and there is little pressure on the proponents of new therapies to establish their relative effectiveness. `` Those technologies that offer the greatest incremental gain for the incremental cost ought to be adopted first,'' the commission said. In addition, the panel said, new technologies that benefit the largest number of members should be selected before `` those whose benefits would be limited to a few members.'' The commission suggested a cap on the cost of new technologies based on `` how many years' worth of earnings ought to be devoted to extending a member's life for one year.'' `` As more and more resources are devoted to extending a life for a short time, it becomes clear that choices must be made between competing goods,'' the panel said. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> created the commission in 1985 after the <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, health organization became the nation's first HMO to provide coverage for heart and liver transplants. `` The increasing sophistication and cost of new technology poses a dilemma for all HMOs and health insurers: the HMO or insurer must balance the welfare of the individual patient against the welfare of all the people who pay premiums into the fund,'' wrote <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, the HMO's president. `` By presenting this summary, we do not mean to imply that <ORGANIZATION> HCHP </ORGANIZATION> endorses all of the commission's conclusions. Our goal is to stimulate discussion in the hope that the community will benefit,'' said <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Avon Says `No' to Mary Kay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has told <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> is n't for sale and sees no potential benefit from combining the two cosmetics sellers. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, stated in a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> vice chairman: `` We strongly believe our opportunities will be better achieved by <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> continuing with our business plan.'' In the letter, released by <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> has had a longstanding interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. `` As I told you last January, we see no advantage to combining our operations through some form of leveraged buyout or other arrangement,'' <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said. The reference was to a Jan. 11 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dinner meeting between <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. The two had no other face-to-face contact and spoke by telephone only once, to set up the meeting. During the meeting, attended only by the two executives, <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> extolled the advantages of being a private company and asked <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> to take Avon private and unite with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> has been given much of the credit for the financial success of the the 1985 leveraged buyout of the Dallas-based door-to-door cosmetics company. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> an LBO could provide <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> with a financial windfall, allowing him to leave the company in a few years several million dollars richer, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> replied that he was n't interested and even if he were contemplating a leveraged buyout he would n't need <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> to do it, according to the Avon spokesman. Although the meeting occurred in January, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had been aware of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>'s possible intentions earlier. The first hint came two years ago when <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> approached <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> about the possibility of buying <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. He said he was working as a consultant for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s management evaluated the idea and decided the two direct sellers would n't make a good match, he said. Plus, Avon sales representatives probably would have reacted negatively because, in some areas of the country, the <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> sales force is the main competition. Several months later in 1987 word came to <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> that someone was preparing a hostile bid, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. At about the same time, a public relations firm <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had hired resigned the account on the grounds there might be a conflict with another client's business. The other client was <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. Over the two years, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has been told <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> has searched unsuccessfully for investment partners to help buy Avon, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> also learned <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> was n't interested in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s international business, due to concerns about the risk of currency fluctuations <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has learned that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> started buying <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> shares last Nov. 10 but stopped short the threshold that would have triggered federal ownerhip disclosure requirements, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. No one at <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> was available to comment on <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s portrayal of the events, a public relations representative said. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> publicly conveyed his company's feelings about <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> in a letter to <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> last week that was released by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. No terms of proposed merger have been mentioned by <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s board rejected an offer by <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to buy <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> for $ 39 a share, or about $ 2.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> later withdrew the offer. In composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday, Avon closed at $ 35.62 -LCB- a share, down $ 1.12 -LCB-.

<TEXT>
 Talks will resume this summer to set standards under which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products could be exported to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after internal trade barriers are lifted there in 1992, it was announced today. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vice president, announced the resumption of talks in a joint communique released here and in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The talke are to be held in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. `` The issues of how standards will be set and what they will be is a top concern of the American business community,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` With this agreement to establish a dialogue, we have made significant progress toward easing that concern.'' The 12 nations comprising the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to remove trade barriers in 1992 and operate as a single $ 4 trillion market with 320 million consumers. Some government and business leaders fear the regulations and technical standards being written for the transition could result in barriers against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON>, who met Tuesday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was attending the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, agreed that products imported into the new European market would have the same access to testing and certification procedures as European products. They also agreed there should be exploratory talks on negotiations to ensure mutually recognized arrangements for product safety and quality, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` Establishing this dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is an important step for us to take together,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. `` It reassures American business and holds great promise for the entire world trading system.''

 American companies were the biggest investors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the number-one destination for Japanese investment overseas last year, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday. Investment by foreign countries in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> jumped sharply last year, and investment by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> overseas hit a record high, they said. Despite the high yen, which makes investing in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expensive, foreign companies increased their investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 46.5 percent to $ 3.24 billion during the fiscal year ended March 31. American companies took 54.7 percent of the total, according to a report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. American investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> jumped 89.1 percent over the previous year to total $ 1.77 billion, the report said. During the same period, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s direct overseas investment hit a record high for the fifth year in a row, jumping 40.9 percent in fiscal 1988 over the previous year to $ 47.02 billion, a ministry official said, citing a report released Tuesday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attracted the most direct investment from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ $ 21.7 billion in fiscal 1988, up 47.6 percent from the previous year. A total of $ 3.95 billion from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> went to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> during the period, up 60 percent, while investment in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> nearly tripled to $ 2.39 billion, the report said. Ministry officials attributed the increase in Japanese direct investment overseas to active expansion of overseas production by Japanese manufacturers and of overseas activities by financial and real estate companies. By industry, direct overseas investment by machinery makers totaled $ 1.43 billion, more than double the level in fiscal 1987; investment by the chemical sector rose 42.1 percent to $ 1.29 billion; the steel and non-ferrous metal sector rose 73.9 percent to $ 1.36 billion; and electric makers were up 25.6 percent to $ 3.04 billion, the report said. In the services sector, financial and insurance firms together invested $ 13.1 billion overseas, up 22.8 percent from the previous year. Real estate firms invested $ 8.64 billion, up 59.2 percent, the report said. The report counted as direct overseas investment any investment of more than 10 percent in an overseas firm, investment in overseas branches by home firms and expansion of their subsidiaries in foreign countries.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is moving to solve a major trade dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by agreeing to provide legal protection from piracy of imported computer programs, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and government officials say. A <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation last week signed a bilateral agreement with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Hills to cover computer software by law, and indicated that by the end of this year the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government would submit a copyright law for legislative approval, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. The industry `` views this agreement with the Chinese as a landmark in U.S.-Chinese intellectual property rights negotiations, but we are keenly aware that progress is still merely in the conceptual stage,'' said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, the association's executive vice president Only last February, a <ORGANIZATION> CBEMA </ORGANIZATION> statement asserted that `` piracy of computer programs is rampant'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Industry officials said the agreement was concluded in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last Thursday. Hours later, Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> mentioned recent `` significant agreements'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on copyright and patent protection issues, but still named <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and seven other countries to a `` priority watch list'' on copyright and patent protection. It calls for intensified negotiations and review by Nov. 1 of their anti-piracy safeguards. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>' office did not immediately comment on the industry statements. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, insisting on anonymity, described the U.S.-China accord as a memorandum of understanding, which is less binding than a formal agreement. Computer association officials said they understood the Thursday agreement staved off harsher treatment for the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's first application last week of the new 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. Three countries, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, were designated for negotiations and potential punitive tariffs for alleged unfair trade barriers. The Chinese Embassy quoted a foreign trade ministry official as saying in a recent speech in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that `` administrative and legislative measures can be taken to protect the interest of the intellectual property rights holders.'' Draft regulations on computer softwear protection should be ready by the end of 1989, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1989 legislative program provides for submission to the People's <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of a draft revision of the patent law, the official, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiangeong </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> also mentioned the traditional Chinese position that intellectual property such as computer software could be protected with buyer-seller contract terms providing for confidentiality. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side has complained this fails to prevent copying and piracy by outside parties. Differences over customs and patent protection have kept <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from making the customary five-year renewal of their Science and Technology Agreement. Instead, they extended it for only nine months last January.

Commissioners rarely bring charges themselves, but <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaull </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> said she believed that Interplace @ <ORGANIZATION> Transworld </ORGANIZATION> Recruit and Recruit <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> are continuing to violate anti-discrimination laws. In addition, a judge for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday prohibiting the company from destroying, altering or removing from the country any documents relating to an <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Recruit Co. was at the center of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s bribery scandal that led to the recent resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. With headquarters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Interplace </LOCATION> is an employment agency with nine offices in cities that include <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>. Recruit <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> shares a headquarters office with <ORGANIZATION> Interplace </ORGANIZATION> and publishes help-wanted magazines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to advertise job openings in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a senior vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Interplace </ORGANIZATION>, said his company and <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> would have no comment until their lawyers had a chance to examine the charges. Court documents include an Interplace memo that describes a code the company allegedly used on job orders to indicate when a client wanted an employee of a particular age, sex or race. As detailed in the memo, `` Talk to Maria'' meant the client preferred Hispanics, `` Mary'' meant Caucasians, `` <PERSON> Mariko </PERSON>'' meant Japanese, `` Adam'' meant men, `` Eve'' meant females and `` Maryanne'' meant blacks. `` Suite 20 to 30'' meant age 20 to 30. Last year, after a former employee threatened to expose the practice, <ORGANIZATION> Interplace </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president <PERSON> Hideyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> `` told employees in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that she had just been instructed ` from the top' to erase codes from all job orders in the computer database,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>, a senior trial attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We can prove <PERSON> Interplace </PERSON> was violating Title VII -LRB- of the Civil Rights Act -RRB- from the job orders we have,'' she said. Most charges are filed by aggrieved parties rather than commissioners themselves. But when employment agencies discriminate, rejected applicants usually do not know they have been harmed.

 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge shot up 0.8 percent in April as it reversed course after posting declines in the previous two months, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. The upward turn in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators allowed the index to steer clear of the traditional signal of a forthcoming recession _ three declines in a row. The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future, had dropped a revised 0.6 percent in March and 0.3 percent in February. Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated, was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing, there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetime expansion through its seventh year. `` It was n't a good bet, it is n't a good bet and it's not going to be a good bet in the fall that a recession is about to occur,'' economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said in anticipation of today's report. Last month's increase in the index was the biggest rise since a similar 0.8 percent jump in January. Using the three-month rule of thumb for predicting recessions, the index has correctly forecast all eight economic downturns that have occured since 1948, but it also has flashed false recession signals on five other occasions. Most recently, the index declined five times in a row in the months surrounding the October 1987 stock market crash, from which the economy emerged unscathed. In April, eight of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up the composite index pointed upward, led by an increase in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods. Other indicators making positive contributions were: rising building permits; a longer average work week; higher stock prices; a decrease in initial claims for jobless benefits; slower vendor deliveries, signaling stronger demand; a gain in orders for new plants and equipment; and an increase in manufacturers' unfilled orders. Three indicators pointed downward: a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; a contraction in the money supply; and falling prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand. The various changes left the index at 145.7 percent of its 1982 base of 100. The index has advanced 1.3 percent over the past six months, compared with a 1.7 percent increase over the previous six-month period. <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> said recent reports on the economy's performance indicate that growth will slow to a more sustainable level and `` suggest this economy is in better shape for growth than even we optimists thought.'' Pessimists, too, are rethinking their views. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has been forecasting a mild recession by year's end but now concedes `` the odds are by no means convincing, even to me.'' `` The evidence is coming in the side of a soft landing _ continued but subdued growth,'' <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said. That is just what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to produce. In March 1988, the central bank began pushing up interest rates in an effort to slow growth just enough to restrain inflation without toppling the country into a recession. <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said an upturn in the index `` does n't mean that we should be looking for the economy to go roaring off but it does weaken the case that the slowdown is going to develop into recession proportions.'' The government reported last week that the economy expanded at a moderate 4.3 percent annual rate during the first three months of the year, but the growth in the gross national product was a lackluster 1.8 percent when a statistical bounceback from last year's drought is removed. That compares with GNP growth of 3.9 percent for all of 1988. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said the latest GNP report indicates that `` Fed policy over the past year appears to be succeeding in steering the economy to a more moderate, but sustainable, growth path.'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that even with an upturn in the leading index, `` the economy is still pretty weak.'' A rebound in the index `` does n't take away from the notion that the economy is slowing down, but it does not imply a recession any time soon,'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said in advance of today's report.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has reached an agreement with 16 creditor nations designed to cut its debt by $ 2.6 billion and refinance 80 percent of its debt interest over the next decade, the government announced. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> announced late Tuesday that the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, made up of representatives of 16 primary creditor nations, was reached in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> earlier in the day. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt would be cut by a refinancing of credits for exportations to the 16 creditor nations involved. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> currently suffers from a $ 107.4 billion debt and is among the largest debtor nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, second only to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. New President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> have made refinancing of the foriegn debt a national priority and <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> has made numerous trips to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for debt negotiations. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in recent months has been presenting creditor foreign banks and governments with a menu of options designed to reduce real servicing costs on the foreign debt. The country paid $ 9 billion in interest and $ 5 billion in principal in 1988 and servicing costs are expected to reach $ 16 billion this year. In a statement released Tuesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called the agreement `` exciting'' and said it was `` a solid additional step in the firm and serious renegotiation of the foreign debt.'' It said members of the Club of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> had accepted the plan, presented by a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> delegation headed by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON>, deputy treasury secretary in charge of international financial affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday that it had formally approved a $ 4.1 billion credit line to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which was first outlined in a letter of credit announced several weeks ago. Of the total, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is to use some 40 percent to pay off its foreign debt.

The company issued a brief statement Tuesday announcing <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s illness, but did not provide details. The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> said a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyeterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> confirmed that <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, 47, was hospitalized there. The spokeswoman declined to provide details at the request of <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s family, the newspaper said. A <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> was in stable condition. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> was hospitalized Friday, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said the executive was hospitalized Wednesday following more than a year of speculation that he was seriously ill. <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> repeatedly has denied rumors that he is suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome or any related illness, the newspaper said The speculation began after he missed 10 weeks of work beginning in July 1987 because of a bacterial infection of the heart lining. <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, who maintains homes in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also was hospitalized at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Presbyterian for that health problem. <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, the grandson of the company's founder, is credited with building <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> into one of the country's major toy companies through a series of acquisitions, including <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and introduction of consistently successful new products. Among <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s well-known toys are GI <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and Transformers. The company had sales of $ 1.34 billion last year, compared with $ 104.3 million in 1980. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s stock climbed $ 1.25 per share on Tuesday, closing at $ 20.62 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, on speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> might be a takeover target because of <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s illness. `` There's lots of speculation going on, but probably very little of substance,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morsilli </PERSON>, manager of the Providence office of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uphanm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` For every 10 takeover stories I hear, maybe one happens.'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> had been running a high fever, `` and he finally got to the point that his doctors advised him to have a rest and get into the hospital. The hope and the intent is that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> will mend and will be back to running this company.'' <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s pneumonia did not appear to be linked to his previous heart infection, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON>'s 40-year-old brother who is <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer, will run the company in the interim, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods rose 2.7 percent in April, the best showing in four months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable and non-durable goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted $ 239.4 billion last month after rising 0.7 percent in March and dropping during the first two months of the year. April's increase reflected higher demand in a variety of industry categories, and would have been even stronger were it not for a 15.8 percent drop in defense orders, which are subject to wide swings depending on when big contracts are signed. Excluding defense, all other orders were up 3.6 percent in April after falling 0.3 percent in March and 2.7 percent in February. April's upturn in factory orders was in line with other recent reports on the economy's performance which analysts say suggest that while growth is slowing, a recession is not imminent. It was the strongest gain since a 4.7 percent increase in orders last December. Earlier today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, shot up 0.8 percent in April after declining during the previous two months. Today's report on factory orders showed that in the volatile transportation category, orders rose 1.4 percent in April after jmping 11 percent in March and falling 7.6 percent in February. Excluding transportation, all other orders were up 3.0 percent last month after falling during the previous two months. Orders for non-defense capital goods, meanwhile, posted a strong 6.1 percent gain in April after rising 2.5 percent in March. The category is considered a good barometer of business investment plans. The overall increase in factory orders last month included a 3.0 percent jump in demand for `` big ticket'' durable goods and a 2.4 percent rise in orders for non-durables. Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 129.2 billion in April after rising 1.0 percent in March. The April increase in orders for durable goods included gains in most industries, led by a 9.3 percent rise in demand for electrical machinery and a 6.0 percent jump in orders for primary metals such as steel. Orders for non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 110.2 billion after rising 0.4 percent in March. Nearly half of the April increase was in the petroleum refining industry. Shipments of manufactured goods rose 2.4 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted $ 233.4 billion, following three consecutive declines.

 Stock prices turned slightly lower in moderate trading today, as the market began to focus on a weakening dollar.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain on Notions That Losses Were Overdone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, partially reflecting notions that prices have fallen too far, too fast in recent weeks. The soybean market posted the strongest early gains, with the price for September delivery of new-crop soybeans opening at $ 6.58 a bushel, 7 -LCB- cents above Tuesday's close. Grain and soybean prices sank on Tuesday, continuing a three-week trend that has taken soybeans for July delivery from about $ 7.45 a bushel to less than $ 7.15, and July corn from about $ 2.75 a bushel to less than $ 2.65 since May 1. The recent, broad decline in prices is due to increased rainfall in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, which has reduced fears of a second consecutive drought year. `` The weather pattern has obviously been different and that has been weighing on the markets and the whole thing has been going down,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.91 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.62 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.67 \ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 8 cents higher with July at $ 7.19 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 68.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 76.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June at 47.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .23 cent higher with July at 29.45 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday with pork bellies down sharply.

The dynamic random access memory chip, or DRAM, was made on an existing production line, demonstrating that it could be manufactured in large volumes, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not say when volume prouction might begin. The chip can retrieve a unit, or bit, of information in 22 billionths of a second, making it two to three times as fast as the current generation of million-bit chips, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. It can store the equivalent of about 100 pages of double-spaced, typewritten text. DRAM chips are still slower than their more expensive cousins, static random access memory chips, or SRAMs. But <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the new chip shows the gap is narrowing. Last week <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced its plant in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, was manufacturing the world's fastest million-bit DRAM that is in volume production. That chip will be used in its AS-400 business computer.

<HEAD>Judge Won't Accept Pennwalt Plea Without Company Executive Present</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge refused to accept a guilty plea from <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the settlement of a pollution case because none of the top corporate officers of the chemical company showed up in the courtroom. `` Are we going to let lawyers plead guilty for them?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Why? What happens to the deterrence we talk about?'' Individuals who plead guilty to crimes are required to appear in court, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` Why should we treat corporations different than individuals?'' he said. Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a special assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, replied that the law allows attorneys to plead guilty on behalf of corporations. `` Maybe that's one of the problems,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said, adding, `` What message is sent to them?'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the company's willingness to pay $ 1.1 million as part of the plea agreement would deter others. `` They just throw money at it that they just pass on to the public,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. The case involved a 1985 spill of a cancer-causing agent into a <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> waterway. The company's attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION> Preston </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thorgrimson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors had approved the plea agreement. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the board and <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s top officers took the case seriously. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said it was n't fair for an unknown board of directors to allow an attorney to plead guilty by submitting a written plea agreement. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> then asked <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> if he wanted <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer or another top executive to appear in court. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> did n't specify what officer would be appropriate but said he would n't accept `` some official who is going to retire in six months.'' The charges stemmed from the spill of at least 75,000 gallons of a chemical containing sodium dichromate into <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>'s Hylebos Waterway in 1985 after the rupture of a 180,000-gallon storage tank that had been poorly maintained. Sodium dichromate is a toxic compound containing hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent. The agreement called for the company to plead guilty to five misdemeanor counts _ two counts of negligently failing to maintain adequate storage tanks at its <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> plant, two counts of discharging pollutants, and one count of failing to promptly report the 1985 spill to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The company agreed to pay the $ 1.1 million, $ 600,000 of it to be placed in an environmental trust fund to be used by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to protect Puget Sound. In exchange, the government agreed to drop criminal charges against three company executives in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. After the hearing, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he expected a company officer to appear before <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>. A new hearing is expected in the next few weeks.

 Stock prices were mixed in moderate trading today, amid a weakening dollar and a new economic report indicating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry is advancing at a healthy clip. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.29 points to 2,474.26 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 1.84 points lower an hour earlier. Advancing and declining issues were even on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 602 issues up, 602 down and 601 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 73.66 million shares. After slight gains early in the day, stock prices weakened, taking a cue from softening bond prices as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar headed toward the day's lows, although it remained firm against the Japanese yen and West German mark. `` A lower dollar hurts bonds which hurts equities,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Also pressuring stocks was a government report that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory orders rose 2.7 percent in April It was the best showing in four months, and led to new speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might not lower interest rates any time soon as earlier suggested. Expectations had grown over the last several days that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might lower interest rates to stem the rising dollar. But analysts said after today's factory orders report that such a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely given its concerns about inflation. Earlier today, stock prices rose after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, shot up 0.8 percent in April after declining during the previous two months. Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated, was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing, there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetime expansion through its seventh year. Also, the number was not strong enough to engender new fears about inflation, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.08 to 178.19. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index had gained 0.28 to 354.69.

<TEXT>
 The government devalued the cordoba against the dollar for the 18th time this year, effective Wednesday, and raised the price of gasoline. The 4.81 percent devaluation, announced Tuesday night, was accompanied by a 5.19 percent rise in the price of gasoline. The dollar will now fetch 8,300 cordobas, up from 7,900 per dollar since May 25. The price of gasoline increased from 14,600 to 15,400 cordobas per gallon on Tuesday, the government said. Prices of public transportation will rise proportionally, the government said. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> depends entirely on imports for gasoline. The government announced a 15.5 percent rise in consumer prices during May, after 12.3 percent inflation during April. Prices rose more than 20,000 percent last year. The government has made severe budget cutbacks by eliminating the government payroll and freezing salaries to try to control inflation. The Sandinista newspaper Barricada on Wednesday quoted <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying the devaluation `` is something normal within the policy the government has been pursuing for several months to keep exports competitive.''

<HEAD>London Shares Close Lower As Pound Continues To Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices closed substantially lower Wednesday, pressured by an early round of selling related to program trades and by further upward pressure on interest rates as the pound continued to slump. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 15.6 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,114.4, just 0.4 point below its best level. At its worst, the index was down 22.3 points at about midday. The latest losses bring the cumulative decline in the 100-share index to 90.3 points, or 4.1 percent, since May 19, the last day before the market's most recent fears of a sterling crisis set in. The pound's weakness already has spurred a rise in British interest rates, by 1 percentage point to 14 percent. Despite this, the currency has continued to drop, sparking worries that further interest rate hikes might be in store. `` The market is on a knife edge at the moment. People do n't know which way to go,'' said one dealer. As a result, trading activity was fairly light, with many players preferring to sit on the sidelines until the interest rate outlook became clearer. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index closed 9.6 points down at 1,755.7. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 8.73 points to close at 1,209.54. Volume came to 536.3 million shares, compared with Tuesday's 458.4 million shares

<HEAD>Demand for Labor Increased in April, Conference Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Demand for labor as measured by the volume of help-wanted advertising increased slightly during April, according to an analysis released Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business research organization, said its monthly Help-Wanted Advertising Index rose to 157 in April from 151 in March. The index tracks the volume of classified advertising in 51 major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspapers and is considered sensitive to changes in demand for labor and general business conditions. Advertising volume rose in all sections of the country except the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and Mountain regions. Substantial gains in volume were noted in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> regions, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economist, said the Help-Wanted Index and other indicators point to continued job growth. However, the gain in the index contrasted with a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that job growth slowed in April while unemployment jumped to 5.3 percent from 5 percent during March.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has begun the first phase of a five-year project to give it the world's largest private international telephone system.

<HEAD>Chrysler Breaks Ground for New Assembly Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A quintet of shovel-wielding corporate, union and government officials broke ground Wednesday for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1-billion <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant, which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> called `` a big risk. The five officials _ <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, chairman of the corporation; <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>; Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>; Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> _ verbally patted each other on the back at the ceremony held under a canopy in a gravel-filled mud field. `` Some risks have to be taken,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said before the shiny shovels turned dirt in a small box on a stage. `` For us, this is a big risk.'' The plant, which will involve a total investment of about $ 1 billion, will replace the aging <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> plant and will begin production of a new line of sport-utility vehicles in January 1992. It will employ about 3,000 people and continue a tradition of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and its forerunners building vehicles at the site on the city's east side since 1907. Before the first spade of dirt was turned Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> plant has been the focus of controversy. There have been lingering questions of how much the city paid for land and equipment when it was getting the property together for the plant. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> was called in after reports of toxic substances being found at the site. Last week, a controversy arose over <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s hiring of a Japanese company to do some design and engineering work for the new plant's paint shop. `` We're talking 20 people in the next year and a half,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said after the ceremony. `` A couple of million dollars, maybe two, maybe three tops, to do some work on a design board. `` It's minuscule. It's so small that it's tough to talk about in the context of a billion bucks,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will make a sport-utility vehicle code-named `` ZJ'' for Jeep and Dodge dealers at the new plant. The company is betting that the sport-utility market, which it relies upon for much of its profits, will remain strong into the next decade. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and French automaker <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> will begin producing a smaller sport-utility vehicle, the `` JJ,'' shortly after the `` ZJ'' begins rolling off the assembly line. The `` ZJ,'' to be offered in two models, will be larger than the Jeep Cherokee, now made at <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Further details about the `` ZJ'' will be unavailable until closer to production. The Dodge and Jeep vehicles will receive other names later. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the `` ZJ'' will not replace the Cherokee, which still will be made in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> after 1992, when the company's five-year contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union expires. The Jefferson Avenue plant makes the Dodge Omni and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> subcompacts. Company officials have said they were unsure whether those nameplates will continue after 1992. The plant is the second assembly plant to be built within <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in the last decade. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> plant began production in 1985.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will lay off 6,000 workers in the next six months because of anticipated cuts in defense spending, the company announced Wednesday. The cuts, which amount to 8 percent of the company's workforce of 75,000, will be in all areas of management, engineering and manufacturing, the company said. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has operations in 12 states, but the bulk of its workforce is in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with 6,000 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The company, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, makes air-to-air missiles, radar for fighter jets, satellites other military gear. The decision was based on executives' expectation, widely shared in the defense industry, that defense budgets under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be smaller than they were in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. `` We're getting down to fighting trim,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> will try to cushion the blow by trying to make some staff cuts through attrition and voluntary resignations, and will offer retraining and job-hunting help. The cuts are n't in response to government action on any one contract, said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. No one contract accounts for more than 6 percent of sales, he said.

Reporters' calls to that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> office invariably are referred to a company spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> resigned for unspecified personal reasons. <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said Wednesday the firm began receiving calls from reporters about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> last Friday. `` I do n't know what prompted it but we were starting to get a lot of calls,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employment was reported in last Friday's issue of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer, an investor newsletter covering credit markets. The younger <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who helped introduce his father at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> last year, has a business degree from <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and plans to enroll in a master's program in business at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the fall, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. His internship was in the credit research department, which studies companies planning to sell high-risk, high-yield bonds through <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. In last year's presidential campaign, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> railed against `` merger-maniacs'' he said were costing jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has played a major role in financing corporate takeovers this decade, many through its junk bond division. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> last year agreed to pay the government $ 650 million and plead guilty to six felonies to settle insider trading and securities fraud charges. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> took a leave of absence earlier this year after he was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also figures in current ethics imbroglios involving two prominent Democrats. House minority whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who announced he would resign because of controversy, bought a $ 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk bond with a loan from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> that did n't require him to put up any of his own money The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are investigating whether <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> received preferential treatment in buying junk bonds through <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as forecasts for more rain in the Corn Belt quieted fears of a second year of drought. `` The midday forecasts were for a continued rainy type of situation here for another five days and maybe longer,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The heaviest precipitation is expected in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, two key corn-and-soybean states that have only partially recovered from last year's disastrous drought. Prices had opened higher on perceptions that the losses of recent weeks had been overdone, but the midday weather forecasts `` weakened the strongest portion of the market,'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Since May 1, soybeans for July delivery have dropped from about $ 7.45 a bushel to less than $ 7.15, and July corn has fallen from about $ 2.75 a bushel to about $ 2.60. At the close, wheat was unchanged to 5 cents lower with July at $ 3.87 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.60 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.66 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with July at $ 7.13 a bushel.

 The stock market was higher in moderate afternoon trading today, boosted by strengthening bond prices. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 11.03 points to 2,486.58 at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 10.48 points higher at 2 p.m. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> time. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 3 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 870 issues up, 571 down and 491 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 132.34 million shares. Stock prices retraced today's earlier losses after an afternoon rally in the bond market, analysts said. Stocks had seesawed through the morning session after the government released two economic reports for April. Prices rose early after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, shot up 0.8 percent in April after declining during the previous two months. Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated, was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing, the economy is still strong enough to power the record peacetime expansion through its seventh year without new fears about inflation. Later, however, stocks declined briefly as the dollar and bonds lost some of their earlier strength following a government report that showed orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories rose 2.7 percent in April. It was the best showing in four months, leading some economists to speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might not lower interest rates any time soon as earlier suggested. Expectations had grown over the last several days that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might lower interest rates to stem the rising dollar. But analysts said after the factory orders report that such a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely given its concerns about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.97 to 179.08. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index had risen 1.36 to 355.77.

<HEAD>Trading Partners Strike Back at U.S. Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American trade policies are incompatible with the multilateral system of trade negotiations and could seriously disturb the world economic outlook, some of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' main trading partners said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, named last week by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration for alleged unfair trade practices, led the assault on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy. Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who is likely to become his country's prime minister this weekend, said any unilateral <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> action could undermine confidence in world economic projections. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> strongly supported the Japanese position as did representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> executive. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> also expressed concern. The criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was voiced as the foreign, trade and economy ministers of the 24-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> began their annual meeting at the secretariat's <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> headquarters. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the only major industrialized nation cited by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was seeking agreement on language in the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION>'s final communique to be issued Thursday criticizing `` discriminatory or unilateral actions contrary to international commitments.'' The communique, however, would not name the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, were named to the Super 301 list of countries that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says have discriminatory trade barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods or investments. Super 301 is the name given to a section of the sweeping 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law, passed by a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> frustrated with a trade deficit that totaled nearly $ 120 billion last year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> denied Americans were backing away from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and said at a news conference the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was strongly committed to a multilateral approach to trade negotiations. He said the Americans were telling their trading partners that the Super 301 provision was complementary to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> process. But judging by reaction from some European delegates, the Americans did not appear to be making much headway with their explanations. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said unilateral trading restrictions would not cure the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit and `` even the threat -LRB- to use them -RRB- endangers the multilateral trading system.'' He said that despite efforts made by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to to limit the list of countries named under Super 301, anxieties about the legislation remained. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said it is vital that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> respect the principles of the multilateral trading system. Two officials of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopherssen </PERSON>, also were critical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation was not compatible with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> and called on the ministers to adopt a firm stand regarding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` No country has to the right to interpret the rules -LRB- of trade -RRB- on its own,'' he said. `` I believe the Americans are sincere when they say Super 301 is an instrument to open frontiers, but it is not the right instrument,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, did not not refer to the controversial legislation in his speech, but called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to do more to reduce their trade surpluses or face increased protectionism. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was moving to promote continued growth for the world economy, in part by undertaking to reduce its budget deficit to $ 100 billion in 1990. `` But many in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION> feel we are being urged to act in a vacuum,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy alone does not drive international economic developments and international policy prescriptions for current problems can not end with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fiscal action.'' The dispute over trade policies overshadowed other items on the ministers' agenda, such as the surge of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, inflation rates in member countries and the environment. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> expressed concern about the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies, saying that if it continued it could undermine efforts to adjust the international economy.

<HEAD>Pesticide Industry Argues That Chemicals Can Make Food Safe</HEAD>

from ... Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House legislation designed to strengthen pesticide regulations is coming under attack from an industry spokesman who says the bill neglects to consider the health benefits of using chemicals on crops. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said recently his organization considers the `` Food Safety Amendments of 1989'' so inflexible as to be unworkable. They apply standards for assessing how risky a pesticide is without considering the benefits, he said. `` We hope to point out that there are many benefits associated with an abundant supply of food that are health benefits,'' <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON> said. He said some fungi and insects are more dangerous to human health than the pesticides that kill them. He suggested, for example, that there might be insect parts in bread and worms in tomato sauce if it were n't for pesticides. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said there are some pesticides that are so dangerous to people, particularly children, that nothing else need be considered in banning them. He said his organization, which led the public outcry against Alar on apples, helped draft the legislation introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment Testimony from both <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s organizations was presented to the subcommittee Wednesday. `` This is an extension of the Alar debate,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` We think it is a pretty good bill.'' `` From the point of view of the farmer, this would clarify the situation and get rid of predicaments like we had with Alar in which farmers may suspect a chemical is dangerous, but because it is legal, they go ahead and use it,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Then there is a public outcry and a market disaster.'' The <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> bill would establish a new health-based food safety standard, taking into account risks to particular population groups, like children. It would not allow the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to weigh economic benefits of pesticide use against health hazards. It would streamline <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s procedures for revoking unsafe pesticides. And, it would give <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> new authority to require that health and safety data be supplied by the industry, with new penalties if the data are not supplied. This was the second day of hearings on the bill. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spoke to the subcommittee May 17.

 The stock market finished higher in moderate trading today after bobbing up and down throughout the session. The market opened weak after Tuesday's losses but quickly rebounded after the government reported that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, shot up 0.8 percent in April following declines during the previous two months. Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated, was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing, the economy is still strong enough to power the record peacetime expansion through its seventh year without new fears about inflation. The market lost steam by mid-morning, however, as the dollar slipped from earlier levels and bonds declined following a second government report that showed orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories rose 2.7 percent in April, the best showing in four months. Analysts said the report prompted speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might not lower interest rates as earlier suggested. Recent expectations were that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might lower interest rates to stem the rising dollar. But analysts said after the factory orders report that such a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely given its concerns about inflation. The impact was brief as the dollar continued its upward trend despite Tuesday's discount rate hike by the Japanese. The dollar closed mixed in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. Bond prices firmed behind the dollar and stocks followed the bond market. Analysts said the stock market's ability to break Tuesday's fall as well as today's rebound shows an underlying strength in the market. `` The lift in the bond market and the fact that the stock market resisted yesterday's chance to go lower says we still have upside momentum,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Also helping prices late in the session was a report that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has come up with a new indicator of inflationary pressures based on the money supply and economic growth Analysts said the new indicator, although experimental, suggests that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has room to ease monetary policy.

<HEAD>Plan Filed For Sunbeam Unit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has filed a plan of reorganization for its <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in an attempt to extract the profitable small appliance maker from bankruptcy court. It is the fifth plan the company has filed since entering Chapter 11 reorganization in February 1988, and an attorney for unsecured creditors who are owed $ 220 million gave the latest plan about the same chances of success and the previous four. `` I do n't give it much chance,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. If approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON>, the plan would pay cash to settle all of the approximately $ 240 million in claims pending against the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. It would leave the Pittsburgh-based parent still in bankruptcy court to haggle with creditors over settling their claims. Allegheny International also said <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> was so aggravated with the collapse of the fourth reorganization plan that he suspended the payment of most fees to attorneys and accountants involved in the case. To emphasize his disappointment that no reorganization plan was submitted for the parent company, <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> also invited the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Trustee to file a request that he appoint a trustee to run the company, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The judge is trying to do something to get some movement in the case,'' <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> said. But because some of the attorneys are paid by banks and insurance companies, not the debtor, `` all it does is put pressure on some people, not necessarily the people who can do anything about it,'' <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> said. The unsecured creditors oppose the latest plan and are very close to finishing their own plan of reorganization, he said. They are also considering asking Cosetti to appoint a trustee. The fourth plan collapsed after investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> discovered that <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> was falling short of its earnings goals. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment bank lowered its takeover bid by $ 70 million to $ 687 million, rreflecting its reliance on earnings estimates to raise takeover funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary encompasses virtually all of the parent's consumer products businesses <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it is confident of raising the estimated $ 250 million needed to reorganize <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION>. It has already begun discussions to find a new chief executive for the subsidiary, which would also get an independent board of directors under the latest plan.

In 1979, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, a steel operator who as chairman, it was said, was not above questioning a blast furnace foreman on the telephone if his unit's production fell behind schedule. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> is succeeded by President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON>, who presided over the company's <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which produced $ 6 billion by selling assets in transportation, real estate and other businesses. <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> and now <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> reflect the company's transformation from an oversized, muscle-bound steelmaker, then called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to a diversified energy and steel corporation known today as <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> One of <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>'s first moves as chairman was to scrap plans to build a planned mammoth steel plant on the shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> officials sighed with relief that the company did not have to carry the additional debt and production capacity into the industry debacle that followed in the 1980s. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> wrote off $ 3 billion in assets, mostly in steel, and closed 140 steel facilities. Companywide employment plunged from nearly 172,000 in 1979 to fewer than 59,000 in 1988, a loss of around 113,000 jobs, most of them in steel. He has often said his most difficult task as chairman was to preside over the steel shutdowns because of the pain they caused in mill towns, including the nearby <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> where he was raised. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 10 billion to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose $ 9.9 billion in sales in 1988 accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company's $ 16.9 billion in sales. Steel contributed $ 5.8 billion, or about a third.

 Oil futures prices were mixed in lackluster trading Wednesday as June contracts closed for unleaded gasoline and heating fuel. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 5 cents to finish at $ 19.90 a barrel. Other contracts also declined. Among refined products, the June contract for unleaded gasoline closed 0.83 cent higher at 67.44 cents a gallon, while other contracts also showed gains. The heating oil contract for June delivery fell 0.44 cent to 48.17 cents a gallon. Other contracts also fell. `` The major feature today was the expiration of the June products,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Gasoline went out strong, heating oil weak.'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> and other analysts said the oil futures market was slow in anticipation of next week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Analysts said gasoline futures prices were strong following the heavy Memorial Day driving weekend and expected strong demand over the summer months. `` I think that market is strong,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, an assistant vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The eight-member <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price monitoring committee is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss recent problems, including quota cheating by some cartel members, followed by a meeting of all 13 oil ministers Monday. The primary focus of next week's meeting is expected to be whether to raise or retain the cartel's 18.5 million barrel-a-day quota. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed last November to keep the level for the first six months of 1989.

<HEAD>Naming Competitors In Advertisements Is Risky Business, Companies

 When <ORGANIZATION> Jartran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> ran ads touting its rental trucks, it put U-Haul's competing trucks in the background, so they looked small. But the ploy backfired: a court ruled the ads were `` deliberately false'' and ordered them halted. <PERSON> Jartran </PERSON> is one of dozens of companies that have learned the hard way that mentioning a competitor's product in an advertisement, a hard-nosed tactic that has become common since 1985, is increasingly risky. `` Every competitive advertiser should be ready to go to court,'' marketing experts <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> warned in the May-June issue of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once your competitor files suit, you can do little to stop the process.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have accelerated the lawsuits last year by strengthening the fair advertising laws. In addition, companies suffering real or imagined slights by competitors have grown testy and are now quick to shoot back, both in counter-ads and lawsuits. Even if they lose in court, they figure, they may dissuade someone else from trying the same thing. Under the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, anyone who misrepresents `` his or her or another person's'' goods or services is liable for damages. That wording closed a loophole in the 43-year-old Lanham Act, which prohibited false claims about one's own products but did not mention `` another person's.'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who are researchers at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, say it is too early to tell whether the tougher law will lead to a rash of lawsuits. But they maintain there was no shortage of such actions under the old law. They counted more than 60 judicial decisions in comparative advertising cases, including 30 since the trend picked up four years ago. Even that number is conservative, they say, because many more cases undoubtedly were settled out of court or did not result in a judicial opinion. In some cases, companies have found to their chagrin, they do not even have to name a competiting product to get sued. When a Tropicana orange juice ad showed Olympic decathlon winner <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenner </PERSON> squeezing oranges into a carton, the message was that <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION>, unlike other brands, was not made from concentrate. But a competitor complained, and a court ruled that the ad was false, because Tropicana juice is not, in fact, squeezed directly from oranges into the carton. It is pasteurized and sometimes frozen first. Even claims with more than a shred of truth behind them have been challenged successfully. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, for example, got in trouble when it said its Now cigarettes had `` the lowest tar of all'' brands on the market, with only 2 milligrams of tar apiece. That was true, at least for comparable king-size brands. But <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> 70, a shorter brand, had only 1 milligram. Its maker, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, went to court and won. In many cases, a successful suit merely leads to an injunction banning the offending ads from the airwaves or print media. But if the plaintiff can show harm, the claims can be expensive. <ORGANIZATION> U-Haul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, was able to prove that it lost sales and faced higher advertising costs, and it was awarded $ 20 million in compensatory damages and another $ 20 million in punitive damages from <LOCATION> Jartran </LOCATION>. Still, advertising agencies say the tactic is more popular than ever, with manufacturers of pain relievers, pickup trucks and soft drinks constantly going head-to-head. `` You have to be very, very sure of your claims,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McElyea </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Chevrolet trucks, which has been pounding <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in comparative ads since late 1987. `` But if you're careful, it can be very effective. The name of the game is, cut through the clutter and make it clear to the customer why your product is better.''

 The dollar slumped Wednesday amid speculation about central bank maneuvering. There were rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and possibly other central banks were selling dollars more discreetly than they have in the past. During most of the dollar's recent run-up the central banks tried to gain extra psychological impact by allowing their market interventions to become public. That strategy did not appear to work. Several times Wednesday the dollar appeared to be under downward pressure even though dealers could not pinpoint anyone who was selling, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, chief currency dealer for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. `` A sudden supply of dollars from an unknown source is very disconcerting to most participants,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. The central banks `` certainly have n't had much success with their name in lights,'' he said. Central banks have tried to rein in the dollar because a high dollar threatens to increase the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit by making American-made goods more costly in world markets. It could also increase inflation abroad. Speculation continued Wednesday that the West German central bank would raise interest rates or that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would lower them. However, many market participants said they considered those steps unlikely. Adding to the choppiness were end-of-the-month dealings to even up currency accounts and the absence of some senior dealers, who were attending an annual foreign-exchange meeting in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The lone currency against which the dollar rose in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was the Japanese yen. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 142.70 yen Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.30 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar rose to 142.90 yen from 142.75. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5682 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.5570 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.5735 from $ 1.5710. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.9815 West German marks, down from 1.9960; 1.7098 Swiss francs, down from 1.7345; 1.2072 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2075; 6.7195 French francs, down from 6.7635; and 1,434 Italian lire, down from 1,440. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.9755 West German marks, down from 2.0100; 1.7055 Swiss francs, down from 1.7545; 6.6855 French francs, down from 6.8085; 2.2460 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2630; 1,443.00 Italian lire, down from 1,452.50; and 1.2061 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2055 Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after having been up in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Slide On Dim Outlook For New Marketing Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices sank Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid growing pessimism about next week's special meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, precious metals slid lower; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed; cattle futures were mixed and pork futures advanced. Coffee settled 2 cents to 4.08 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 1.3068 a pound. The sell-off was prompted by a report that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, remained determined not to attend the talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> unless coffee producers first offer a proposal acceptable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The five-day meeting of most of the world's largest coffee-producing and coffee-consuming nations is aimed at producing a new International Coffee Agreement to replace the six-year pact that expires on Sept. 30. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the organization's largest consumer member, is resisting a push to simply extend the existing agreement, calling instead for tighter restrictions on sales of coffee at discount prices to countries that are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday's sharp decline in prices suggests an abrupt change of attitude among traders who had grown optimistic about a new agreement following a meeting last week in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> and coffee-producer representatives from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I'd say the odds for an agreement are 50-50, and it's unlikely that anything will be hammered out until it comes down to the wire in September,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, a market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the selling was also a reflection of the mild weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest coffee producer, at the beginning of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> winter season `` The market will be increasingly trading off the weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. Silver fell to a 33-month low and gold prices also slipped on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> despite some weakening of the dollar's value against other major currencies. The decline indicated a continuing lack of investor interest in precious metals as an inflation hedge. Gold settled $ 2.40 to $ 3.20 lower with June at $ 363.30 a troy ounce; silver was 7 cents to 7.7 cents lower with June at $ 5.16 a troy ounce, the lowest spot silver price since Aug. 29, 1986. Most grain and soybean futures prices retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as forecasts for more rain in the Corn Belt quieted fears of a second year of drought. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a six-to-10-day forecast calling for normal rainfall in most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the middle of next week. Wheat settled unchanged to 5 \ cents lower with July at $ 3.87 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with July at $ 2.60 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 \ cents higher with July at $ 1.66 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to \ cent higher with July at $ 7.14 Crude-oil futures prices notched lower while futures prices for refined products ended mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in choppy activity fueled by conflicting statements from various <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers regarding oil production and demand. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 10 cents lower with July at $ 19.90 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June at 48.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .28 cent lower to .83 cent higher with June at 67.44 cents a gallon. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .45 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June at 68.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 76.45 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .65 cent higher with June at 47.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .43 cent higher with July at 29.90 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Economic Indicators Soar, Easing Recession Worries</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS inverted March and February figures in 2nd graf: ``The
increase ... Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge jumped 0.8 percent in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday, easing fears that the nation might be about to tumble into a recession. The increase in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators followed declines of 0.3 percent in February and 0.6 percent in March. Three monthly declines in a row has been a traditional signal of a possible recession on the horizon. `` We believe there will be a slowdown that is gradually occurring in the economy, but it's not going to ultimately end in a recession,'' said ecnomist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It was a bit too premature to call for a recession later this year based on the data in February and March,'' Still, analysts were not suggesting the strong numbers for April meant a robust economy this summer. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the report suggests that while there `` was a bit of a rebound in April from March, the general story about the economy is that it is slowing down and slowing dramatically.'' While a three-month drop in the index has preceded all eight recessions since 1948, there also have been five similar series of declines _ including the five consecutive months surrounding the stock market crash in October 1987 _ that were not followed by recessions. In another report showing the economy was still expanding, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said factory orders rose a strong 2.7 percent in April to $ 239.4 billion. That followed a 0.7 percent increase in March after declines of 1.2 percent and 2.0 percent in January and February. The index of leading indicators is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months in the future. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said recent reports show `` the economy is confused, somewhere between boom and bust. But he noted that over the past six months, `` there's been some pretty steady decelerating in the growth of the index.'' Commerce reported that the leading indicators rose 1.3 percent over the past six months compared with 1.7 percent in the previous half-year. The April report showed that eight of the eleven indicators in the index rose, led by increased manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, increased building permits and a longer average workweek. Other pluses were higher stock prices, lower initial claims for jobless benefits, slower vendor deliveries meaning growing demand, more orders for plants and equipment and an increase in manufacturers' unfilled orders. On the minus side were the third consecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence, a drop in the money supply and lower prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand. <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> said he was watching closely the consumer confidence index. `` That has been a fairly good leading indicator on its own of a recession,'' he said. `` It has n't dropped nearly enough to indicate that a recession is coming, but if it dropped dramatically over the next three or four months, we would be concerned.'' Instead <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> concludes that the `` enconomy is in a slowing mode,'' heading for a soft landing with growth over the next year of 1.5 percent. Growth in the gross national product for the first three months of 1989, with the statistical bounceback from last year's drought removed, was 1.8 percent. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, also sees `` a soft landing _ continued but subdued growth.'' A soft landing, rather than a recession, is what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> hopes to achieve in its effort to contain inflation by tightening credit. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> forecasting director, said he believes `` it would be a mistake to interpret April's uptick ... as an indication that the economy is in good shape. `` Persistent declines in the money supply ... are a harbinger of a more dramatic slowdown than most analysts expect,'' he said. `` Historically, a falling money supply has led to a large decline in overall economic growth.'' The drop in the money supply in April was the fourth in a row. The April Index of Leading Economic Indicators stood at 145.7 percent of its 1982 base of 100.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> is looking for a buyer for its <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION> department store chain, saying Wednesday it would use the proceeds to expand its insurance business. <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> said it would begin soliciting bids in the next three weeks and has retained the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to advise the company on offers for the chain that has stores in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and had sales last year of $ 313 million. A sale is not expected to occur until early fall. `` I think it's a wise move,'' said analyst <PERSON> Vita </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Firemark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting and investment banking firm at <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` Many companies in the industry who diversified in the last decade are now streamlining their operations.'' Investors appeared to cheer the news. In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.50 a share to $ 29.75 in Wednesday's session. Analyst <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopson </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> estimated a minimum value of $ 20 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION>, or $ 140 million. The company has refused to speculate on what a sale would bring or who would buy its retail business, but has valued <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION> at a minimum of $ 73 million. <PERSON> Hopson </PERSON> said a logical suitor might be <ORGANIZATION> Dillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, but that he expected several other companies also would be interested. A call seeking comment from <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>'s was not returned. Asked about the possibility of a management buyout, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION>, said managers have decided to keep their options open. `` It's better to wait and see what the opportunities are,'' he said. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION> has outperformed the industry in recent years but it would take tremendous amounts of capital to continue the performance. <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 8.3 million on $ 313 million in sales last year and has been improving steadily in recent years. In 1984, for example, it earned $ 680,000 on sales of $ 188.6 million.

 Stocks seesawed Wednesday but ended mostly higher, supported by a late recovery in the bond market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.60 points to close at 2,480.15. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 896 up, 558 down and 505 unchanged. After a weak opening, stocks rebounded following a government report that its chief economic forecasting gauge shot up 0.8 percent in April. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators had declined during the previous two months and economists had warned that a third consecutive decline would signal a recession. The market quickly lost ground, however, as the dollar slipped and bonds declined following a second report from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that showed orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories rose 2.7 percent in April, the best showing in four months. That report indicated the economy is still going strong, prompting speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might not loosen its hold on interest rates. The impact was brief, though, as fear of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening faded and the dollar recovered from earlier sluggishness, lifting bond prices and inciting some late-afternoon buying on Wall Street. `` The main factor was the bond market because of the dollar and growing confidence that the economy is slowing down and that interest rates are going to come down,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Late word that the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might not raise its discount rate also firmed prices before a last-minute selling spree eliminated much of the gains in the final minutes of trading The market lost ground in the final minutes of trading. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 162.53 million shares, up from 151.78 million shares Tuesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 190.68 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 13.102 billion, or 0.49 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.74 to 178.85. Among blue-chip stocks, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> led the rally closing up 1 -RRB- at 109 | Digital Equipment closed -RRB- higher at 91 ~, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> advanced 1 | to 56 -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -LRB- to 139 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 8 to 127.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> is test-marketing a new, virtually nicotine-free cigarette that the company believes has as much flavor as regular cigarettes. Published reports said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was testing the cigarette, but the company refused to confirm or deny the reports Wednesday, saying it does not comment on product testing. However, a source, who asked not to be identified, said the reports were correct. The lower nicotine levels in the new cigarette _ which will be sold under the names Merit Free and Next from Merit _ are achieved through a process similar to the decaffeination of coffee. The cigarette's competitors, which include <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Now, use a different technology that affects the taste of the tobacco. The new cigarette will contain 0.1 milligram of nicotine, the same amount as in <LOCATION> Carlton </LOCATION> and Now. Low-nicotine cigarettes appeal to smokers who are trying to cut down their intake of harmful substances contained in tobacco smoke. The prospect of a new, potentially successful product apparently appealed to investors Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.12 -LCB- a share to close at $ 139.12 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading.

 If <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is so eager to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, it should simply raise its $ 1.1 billion offer, a lawyer for a competing bidder told a <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge Wednesday in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` Why does n't Tyson open its pocketbook?'' said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balotti </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balotti </PERSON>'s comment came at a hearing before Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, on a request from <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> to block a proposed merger announced May 20 between <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON>. After listening to arguments from lawyers representing <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> retired to consider <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s motion. He did not say when he would rule, but <PERSON> Balotti </PERSON> said it could take up to two weeks. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has offered $ 1.1 billion in cash for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' stock, while <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> in a stock swap valued at about $ 1.3 billion. Tyson lawyer <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> managers have improperly favored <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> throughout a buyout squabble that began last year. `` This battle has been bruising and expensive,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Balotti </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> have a legitimate agreement calling for a shareholder vote on the merger, and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McNew </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, asked <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> to allow that voting. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, can top <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s offer if it wants <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> shareholders to reject the merger, <PERSON> McNew </PERSON> said. `` Tyson does n't want to compete,'' he said. A shareholders vote on the proposed merger is expected in July. The merger, to be accomplished through a stock swap, would be worth $ 74.81 a share or $ 1.3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> shareholders based on the value of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> shares at the time the agreement was announced. Lawyers told <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>, however, that the deal likely would be worth about $ 68 a share based on the longterm expected value of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has issued a cash tender offer for $ 63.50 a share or $ 1.1 billion for all of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the nation's largest poultry processor, has been trying to take over <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> since last October, and the battle has been tied up in <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>'s court since <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> announced a previous merger proposal last November. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> shareholders rejected that proposal in April, but an `` asset option agreement'' included in the plan still is at issue in the continuing debate. The asset agreement allows <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> to purchase about a third of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> if the company is bought by someone else. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s challenge of the asset agreement is expected to go to trial, but no trial date has been set. Observers of the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> battle say the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> company likely would function as an independent subsidiary with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, while the same would not be true with <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified company heavily dependent on fresh fryer sales. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> specializes in agricultural services and food. Although <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> is considered a friendly suitor for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachbar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> were dealing behind the scenes until shortly before the proposed merger was announced. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> offered to pay <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million to step aside but an agreement based on that offer fell apart at the last minute, <PERSON> Nachbar </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Singer Co.. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> resumed testifying at his federal securities fraud trial Wednesday, but only after his lawyers revamped their case to compensate for an unfavorable ruling by the judge On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> ruled that if <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> testified that he did n't believe he was breaking the law in two takeover attempts, it would open up a line of questioning to prosecutors about what his lawyers told him at the time. Such lawyer-client conversations are usually confidential under the so-called attorney-client privilege. When <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> ruled that privilege would be waived if <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> was asked and answered certain questions by his defense lawyers, they asked for an adjornment to re-consider their strategy. `` We have determined an your honor,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> at the beginning of Wednesday's session `` that we do not intend to pursue anything upon the direct examination of Mr. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> that would waive the attorney-client privilege.'' <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> added later: `` We have restructured our planned examination of Mr. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>.'' Under <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>' questioning, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> described his acquisition of stock in H.H. <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing and construction concern and apparel-maker <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two transactions listed in the indictmet against him. His testimony was to continue Thursday. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is accused of conspiracy, violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986. None of the charges involve <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s $ 1.06 billion takeover of Singer last year. In two of those four transactions _ the 1985 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shares and the 1986 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Hammermill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock _ the government contends <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> falsely claimed to be using millions of dollars of his own money, when most of the money actually was raised by others. But the defense has contended <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> acted in `` good faith'' and did not believe he was breaking the law in filing misleading documents with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In statements he made to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1988, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> said he was merely following his then-lawyers' advice when he supplied misleading information on <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> forms. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, however, said by taking the witness stand and invoking that `` good faith'' defense under questioning by his own lawyers, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> was waiving the attorney-client privilege and prosecutors could ask on cross examination what was the basis for his belief that he was not breaking any laws _ more specifically _ what had his lawyers told him at the time. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> was not required to testify. If convicted, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine on each count.

<HEAD>FCC Recommends Abolition of Copyright System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> is recommending to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it abolish a 13-year-old copyright system that allows cable television operators to pay a percentage of their income to retransmit over-the-air TV programs, officials said Wednesday. The commission, in a ruling it made Tuesday and released Wednesday, said cable TV companies should negotiate with broadcasters and producers on a case-by-case basis for programs. Critics of that approach say it would be very costly for cable operators to negotiate for every program individually and could result in fewer programs being made available to cable subscribers or cause subscription costs to go up. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 compelled broadcasters and program owners to allow cable operators to retransmit their programs. In return for this `` compulsory license,'' cable companies were required to pay a specified percentage of their revenues to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Copyright Office. The office's <ORGANIZATION> Copyright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royalty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> decides how to allocate the fees among broadcasters, program owners and entities such as sports franchises. In establishing the rules, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reasoned that the costs of working out contracts for every program would stymy the infant cable TV industry. The cable industry last year paid $ 188 million in compulsory license fees, according to <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the current system `` impedes the efficient functioning of the market'' and `` weakens the incentives of producers to respond'' to consumers' tastes and programming preferences. He said it also subsidizes program acquisition by cable operators and disadvantages competitive alternatives to cable. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, president of the cable association, said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> `` seems to be a little off the deep end.'' <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year extended the present copyright system to companies that package TV programs for delivery to backyard satellite dish owners rather than making those packagers negotiate for shows one at a time. `` Congress and the commission seem not to share the same view on these matters,'' <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said in a statement. The commission last year made a preliminary decision to recommend repeal of the compulsory license rules for programs that come from stations located outside local viewing areas. `` Superstations'' such as <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and WGN in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are examples of these so-called distant signals. Cable operators use satellites or microwave systems to relay these signals around the nation and then pipe them into homes locally. In its new decision, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> recommended that the rules be repealed for all signals, both from distant broadcasters and from local broadcasters such as channels 4, 7, 9 and so on. Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> concurred with <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> in the ruling. Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> concurred with repealing the distant signal provision, but he argued for keeping the compulsory license for local signals. `` It is conceivable that under full copyright liability cable operators may choose not to carry local broadcast signals due to the costs'' of obtaining rights to retransmit the programs, <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should, instead, recommend that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reimpose rules requiring cable systems to carry all local broadcast stations. He said these `` must-carry'' rules should n't exist without compulsory license for local signals. He also disputed the agency staff's contention that costs of negotiating contracts were lower today, per subscriber, than in 1976. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said it was `` surprising'' the commission was recommending repeal of the rules for local signals. He said that would create a situation in which `` cable could not even retransmit local signals by joint agreement _ the original rights owners in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> would have to consent too, presumably for a price.''

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> on Wednesday unveiled an ambitious plan to transform <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s stagnant, debt-burdened economy into a robust modern engine generating a steady 6 percent growth a year The National Development Plan for 1989-1994 proposes the `` modernization of the nation in all its aspects'' during <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' six-year term of office The <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration's 164-page blueprint touches on everything from drinking water to foreign policy, but the centerpiece is economics. `` The economic strategy of the plan has two priority goals: achieving a growth rate of around 6 percent a year and ... maintaining stability so price increases are comparable to those of our commercial partners,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said in a ceremony at the National Palace unveiling the plan. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' prescription for economic health includes cutting debt payments, keeping inflation down and prices stable, encouraging productivity, savings and investment and modernizing finance, technology and industry. One of the most critical elements is renegotiating the $ 107.4 billion foreign debt, the second-largest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> paid $ 9 billion in interest and $ 5 billion in principal in 1988 and servicing costs were expected to reach $ 16 billion this year. But <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> warned against blaming the debt for all of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s problems It will take more than stemming the financial hemorrhage, he said, to transform the nation. `` Let's not fall into thinking that once this obstacle has been overcome, we will have resolved all our problems,'' he warned. `` The internal effort to produce and produce better is irreplaceable.'' The plan, which the Constitution requires every president to present during his first six months in office, reiterates <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' election campaign and inaugural address promises of economic recovery in a more democratic <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with a higher standard of living <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was able to point to substantial progress since his Dec. 1 inauguration. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has liberalized its rules on foreign investment, won concessions and credits from international creditors, kept the lid on inflation, eased its dependence on oil and sold off some state-owned industries. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement with the Club of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a group of 16 creditor nations, designed to cut the debt by $ 2.6 billion and refinance 80 percent of the interest over the next decade. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said it had approved a $ 4.1 billion credit line to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 40 percent of which can be used to pay off the foreign debt. The 41-year-old president stressed the importance of creating jobs and fostering a work force that compete in world markets in both productivity and quality. He said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must keep pace with a changing world where competition and technology are critical and commercial markets are interdependent. The Salinas reforms follow decades of protectionism that saw the Mexican economy grow by an impressive 6 to 7 percent each year but also fostered inefficient industry dependent on government subsidies and import barriers. They also are an antidote to the economic crisis that began in 1982, when the oil boom crashed and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a heavy borrower, suddenly went from riches to rags. The buying power of the average worker is now half what it was in 1982 and the party that has ruled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929 barely won the 1988 presidential election.

<HEAD>Gallup Poll Says Channel One Reaction More Favorable Upon Viewing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who've seen the teen-oriented Channel One news show are more likely to rate it favorably than those who merely get a verbal description of the advertiser-supported experiment, a Gallup study concludes. `` Although majorities in the general public generally approve of the idea of Channel One, there is some level of apprehension,'' said the survey by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` This apprehension appears to diminish once the program is viewed,'' said the group, which released its findings Wednesday. The survey referred to a 12-minute daily news show _ which includes 2 minutes of commercials _ recently beamed to six high schools on an experimental basis. In exchange for having students watch the show each day, each school gets $ 50,000 worth of video equipment free, and the company profits through the advertising. The company that created Channel One, <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knoxville </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to decide whether to expand the project nationally. Some groups laud Channel One as a good way to get news to teens and to get sorely needed equipment into the schools. Others say that it's a bad idea to have the captive, malleable audience of teen-agers watching commercials each day in a public school room and that educators could use the 12 minutes for other things. Chairman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said his company two months ago arranged for the Gallup attitude poll because it expected various school boards and superintendents would request such information, although so far they have not contacted the company for it. For its study, Gallup interviewed 1,046 shoppers in malls in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state after showing them a videotape of a Channel One show, including commercials. Those responses were compared with another group _ 1,007 people 18 and over who were telephoned randomly across the country and given only a general, verbal description of the show. The verbal description consisted of its basic offering -LRB- news and features -RRB-, timetable, equipment involved and the requirement of daily watching. It also mentioned that there were commercials and that the equipment was free. Of the telephoned group, 57 percent said they thought Channel One is an excellent or good idea, while 34 percent said it's a fair or poor idea. Of the shopping mall group, 85 percent of the 528 teen-agers said they'd be interested in seeing Channel One in their local high school. Eighty-seven percent of the 254 parents polled said the same. Eighty-eight percent of the 264 non-parent adults said they'd like to see Channel One in their local schools In addition, more than 80 percent of teen-agers and non-parent adults who saw the videotape said showing commercials with the news program was acceptable. Seventy-four percent of the parents who saw the tape said the same. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said he was `` optimistic'' about the possibility of expanding the project to all schools which want it, but wo n't make a decision until he's finished mulling over other test results. The other tests include a survey of about 500 teachers, another on the views of 10,000 students who participated in the pilot showings, marketing tests and a test designed to show whether students who watched Channel One retained the information it contained.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will expand from 79 daily flights in June to 221 in July, the company's largest increase in service since a strike began March 4. Eastern said it will serve 27 cities in June and 52 in July as it moves toward a new full schedule of 600 flights by the end of the year. `` This is a significant part of a multi-phase plan to establish Eastern as a competitive, dependable, full-service airline,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, vice president for marketing. Striking unions scoffed at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pilots union, said the company wo n't have enough pilots in July to make 221 flights daily. `` It's all flap and no throttle,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. `` Unless they actually do it, it's just talk.'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said Eastern has been flying 92 to 112 flights daily since the beginning of the strike. The company has fewer than 250 pilots, he said. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, said an expanded schedule would be of little help to the carrier. `` Travel agents are not booking Eastern now because they're not dependable,'' <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said. `` Eastern is going to be flying a lot of empty airplanes.'' Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors March 9, five days after the start of a strike by Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight attendants. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to report at a hearing Thursday that no viable offers have been made for the airline, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday's editions. Eastern's unions have recently supported proposed buyout proposals from two investor groups, one led by former <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and the other by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> has challenged the two groups to put at least $ 100 million of their own cash at risk. Management, on the other hand, is proceeding with a plan to rebuild <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a smaller carrier and sell $ 1.8 billion of its assets separately. Eastern said the expanded schedule will allow the company to recall by July more than 1,700 non-union workers placed on `` no work'' status when the airline curtailed service shortly after the strike started. Eastern said it has 5,000 employees now and eventually will have about 17,000, compared with a pre-strike total of around 30,000. Eastern was operating 1,000 flights daily before the strike and has 110 now. Sixty daily flights currently are part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle business that has been sold to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> The shuttle business is not included in figures for flights planned in June and July, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest hub, the airline will launch 82 daily flights to 26 cities by July 2. New York-Bermuda service begins June 9. Service from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, will resume June 1. Eastern also plans to increase flights between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during the summer. The carrier said it will continue its 200 weekly flights between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and 14 cities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Eastern said it will add about 614,000 seats in July. `` Eastern's comeback this summer will feature bargain fares normally associated with the introduction of new service,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in a news release. `` With $ 39 to $ 139 domestic fares, our customers can take advantage of the lowest fares in the sky _ without restrictive penalties or length-of-stay requirements.'' For a limited time, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> also will offer first-class tickets at prices below normal economy-class fares to attract business travelers. `` Because of the turmoil here,'' company spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said, `` we'll need to use price as an incentive to get customers to try us again.'' On June 9, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said, it will resume or add service from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> On July 2, service from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will be restored to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, S.C.
