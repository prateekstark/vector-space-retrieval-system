 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s famous Peachtree Street will be turning peachy soon. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a grower-financed group that promotes the state's peach crop, will donate 20 trees next month during a ceremony in downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` During the national Democratic Convention in July, visitors wondered why there were no peach trees,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` I thought the <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should do something to remedy that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said she contacted <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> officials and learned that the peach trees that once lined the street were not replaced when they died because they created a nuisance. `` The fruit attracts bugs and the trees are n't very tolerant of auto pollution,'' she said during a recent interview at a meeting of peach growers in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. She said city officials were skeptical about planting peach trees along the street until she discovered a variety that produces beautiful blooms, but no fruit. `` That's what we're going to plant,'' she said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> began in the 1840s as the terminus of the Western and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, running northward along a line of ridges, quickly became an important commercial and residential thoroughfare in the growing city. Beginning near <LOCATION> Woodruff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> downtown, the street runs through office, hotel and business complexes. Further north, <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> is lined with stately homes built early in the century. The road ends more than 40 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in rural northeast <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s trees will be planted in <LOCATION> Woodruff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> during a ceremony tentatively set for March 23, said Ms. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who hopes the tree planting will encourage others to plant peach trees along the street. `` It restores some meaning to the name of <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION>,'' she said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: The Valentine's Day Love-in in El Salvador</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The five Central American presidents showed more interest in making love than war last Tuesday, an appropriate activity for Valentine's Day, but the question now is whether anybody is going to cheat. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he's wary of the promises Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made to hold a free and fair election because he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leader has been unfaithful in the past after making similar pledges. But the four other leaders _ all friendly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ who assembled with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> at a beachside resort in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> believed <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s promises were heartfelt enough to give him the benefit of the doubt. The result was unanimous agreement on a lengthy communique designed to lay the groundwork for two objectives all sides say they want: peace and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., felt <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s stated commitment in the communique to democracy was so convincing that the Nicaraguan Contras should declare victory `` I think this is what the Contra forces in essence have been asking,'' said <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, long a Contra antagonist. `` I think it presents a unique opportunity for them to take advantage.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was more skeptical. `` What's troubling me is that ... claims like this have been made at one time, only to see those claims repudiated,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday. In return for his promises of democratic reform, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> got his colleagues from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to agree to draw up a plan within 90 days that will lead to the demobilization of the Contras. That has been <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s highest priority for years. A year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted his wish to suspend military aid to the rebels; now, his neighbors are agreeing to their demobilization. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been playing the unaccustomed role of bystander to events in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has yet to make some key appointments, including some at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and has been occupied with other issues, leaving a vacuum in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> which the five countries decided to fill this week. The administration's hand in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> seems to get weaker by the day. Two years ago, some in the administration had high hopes that the Contras would be able to topple the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. A year ago, the goal was reduced to just getting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve humanitarian aid for the rebels. Now, the administration wants to find a way to head off the planned Contra demobilization, hoping that their continued existence _ if only as a potential military menace _ will induce <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to keep his word. At a minimum, this has been an interesting week for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> doctrine, the grand design of the former president to assist the Contras and anti-communist rebels elsewhere who are fighting pro-Soviet regimes. The Contras were once the centerpiece of that doctrine but they are now reduced to what amounts to welfare recipients: huddled in austere camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border, living off U.S.-donated food, facing the specter of demobilization, and praying that the political winds in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will some day favor them again. In contrast to the Contras, the news was somewhat better this week for another pet rebel group of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s _ the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance. The day after the Central American presidents called for the demobilization of the Contras, the last Soviet soldier withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a major triumph both for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and for the anti-Soviet resistance. But the Soviet-backed regime is still in power and peace still seems distant in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as the two sides, both heavily-armed by their respective superpower patrons, continue their struggle with the Soviet Army on the sidelines for the first time in nine years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressed the Soviets to withdraw for years but, now that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has complied, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is escalating its objectives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would not be fair for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to cut off aid to the rebels after the departing Soviet soldiers left behind all those fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, howitzers and other equipment. So in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the somewhat incongruous Valentine's Week prospect is for a lot more warmaking than lovemaking.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will continue helping rebel groups in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal, and fully intends to support the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> when their current aid expires next month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he preferred a peaceful reconciliation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> but was concerned that departing Soviet forces may have stockpiled weapons for the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and thus leave an uacceptable imbalance,'' he said in a session with reporters in the Oval Office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks came a day after Soviet troops completed their withdrawal. Their departure has caused widespread fears that a struggle for control by competing guerrilla groups could throw <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into a civil war. `` The time for recrimination is over,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The time for bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions get together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a peaceful <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with no more bloodbaths.'' Turning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I have every intention of seeing that these people receive humanitarian support. But how that comes about, we'll just have to wait and see.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the statement even though administration officials acknowledge that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has gained the upper hand on the question of giving assistance to the rebels. The current aid program expires March 31. New questions have been raised about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a result of the agreement by the presidents of five Central American nations, including <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, to a peace plan that would produce free elections by February 1990 in exchange for dismantling the Contra fighting force. On other matters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ He would `` strongly oppose'' any attempt to outlaw all semiautomatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols and rifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling the trigger The weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was used to kill five children in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard last month. _ The tedious pace of making personnel appointments has him fustrated But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that `` I do n't think it's hurting the government.'' _ He hopes his campaign for high ethical standards in government has not `` created something that just carries things too far. He expressed sympathy for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, his nominee as secretary of health and human services, who gave up accumulated sabbatical pay to join the government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had `` made the right decision'' to sell stocks in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank holding company that holds Third World loans. While applauding the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as `` a new chapter in the history'' of that country, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he does not accept the Soviet call for a cease-fire and arms embargo. During a Soviet Embassy news conference, Minister-Counselor <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON>, the second-ranking official, said `` the question at stake at the present time is this: either restoration of peace on the Afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed.'' But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said there has been massive stockpiling by the Soviets in recent months. Supplies provided to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime reportedly include numerous fighter aircraft and helicopters, dozens of medium tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers and scores of other artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles.

<TEXT>
 The battle for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian heartland will have a profound impact on efforts to hold this fractured country together The power struggle appears to be finely balanced between army commander <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, head of the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia. But political figures say <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> must crush <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s heavily armed fighters quickly if he is to have any chance of victory. Should <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> come out on top, he likely will emerge as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s next president, filling a vacuum caused when <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired Sept. 22 No successor has been elected because Christians opposed the Syrian-backed candidates. If <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> wins, a senior Moslem official said, `` It'll be the final divorce, the irrevocable partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ... and possibly a new round of civil war fighting.'' Electing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> would make accommodation of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Lebanese Moslem and leftist allies possible and avert the threatened formalization of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s partition into sectarian cantons. Removing <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, fiercely anti-Syrian and anti-Moslem, has long been a key demand of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> allies, who allege the militia commander has close ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> says the 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate are an occupation force, and he demands their unconditional withdrawal as a precondition for a Christian-Moslem settlement. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> appears to be aiming to drive <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> out of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, isolating him north of the city, so that the capital can be reunited and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> convened to elect him president on a platform of reunifying the country. Minutes before <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> stepped down, he named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> prime minister of a caretaker military government until a successor could be elected. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> sought to strengthen his presidential chances by forging a hasty and uneasy alliance with <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>. That outraged <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies. They rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and supported the predominantly Moslem Cabinet of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> that had governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. The split fractured the 42,000-man army, long plagued by sectarian divisions, and deepened prospects of formal partition. Western diplomats in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> doubt <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops will be able to swiftly dislodge the Lebanese Forces from their strongholds along 25 miles of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The army has superior armor and firepower. But there's the issue of loyalty,'' said one diplomat, who requested anonymity. `` Its questionable how long <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops and officers will be willing to press the campaign against their coreligionists in the Lebanese Forces.'' Most of the fighters on both sides are Maronites, and pressure for a cease-fire is escalating from the sect's spiritual and political leaders. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> counts mainly on three brigades trained by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION>, as well as three battalions of commandos and military police. These units total about 12,000 men, with 98 U.S.-supplied M-48 battle tanks and 50 French-built AMX-13 light tanks. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s militia has 6,000 hard-core fighters with thousands more reservists. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> has 12 M-48s plus 60 T-54 tanks. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but its peace efforts have bogged down in the country's unending violence and the complex puzzle of its politics. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s alliance with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has also been strained by a challenge from the Tehran-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> for supremacy of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiite Moslems, the country's largest sect. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the mirror image of the Lebanese Forces on the Moslem side, seeks to create an <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Its power has been weakened by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main surrogate, the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, in fighting aimed at eliminating <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s Moslem extremists. That would make a Christian-Moslem settlement easier.

 Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> announced a tentative settlement of the 22-week <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> strike late Thursday night, but released no details of the agreement. The settlement ends the walk-out that began last September, and concludes the longest running symphony strike in American orchestral history. `` For all intents and purposes, the strike is over,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said at an 11 p.m. news conference. The 96 members of the orchestra must still ratify the agreement, which <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said could occur by this weekend. The next <ORGANIZATION> BSO </ORGANIZATION> concerts are scheduled for next Thursday and Friday nights. If the strike had not been settled by Monday, the orchestra would have been forced to cancel its East Coast tour scheduled for next month. Last November, the players proposed a four-year contract that would have brought their salaries to $ 1,050 a week in the last six months of the 1991-1992 season. Management countered by offering a contract that would have paid the players a minimum of $ 1,030 a week in the last three months of that season, including guarantees for broadcast and recording work. Under the contract that expired in September, the players had earned a minimum of $ 770 a week. Thursday's negotiating session at the State Office Building was the first between the two sides since mediated contract talks broke off nearly a month ago.

<HEAD>$13.2 Billion to Give Medicaid Coverage to All Below Poverty Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government and the states would have to spend at least $ 13.2 billion more to expand the Medicaid program to cover all Americans who live in poverty, according to a coalition led by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The coalition proposed such a plan Thursday to cover the estimated 11 million people whose incomes are below the federal poverty level but who do not now qualify for the health assistance program. `` Medicaid simply does not work adequately in its current form,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the coalition's committee on Medicaid. `` We call for a system that truly cares for the needs of the poor.'' Though Medicaid was established as a federal-state program to serve the medical needs of the poor, fewer than half of the 33 million Americans below the poverty line are covered by the program, the coalition said. Eligibility varies from state to state, and as health-care costs have soared, states have trimmed growth in their Medicaid costs by restricting eligibility. As a result, the average income threshold for eligibility in 1988 was $ 4,792 gross annual income for a family of three _ 49 percent of the federal poverty level of $ 9,690, the report said. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the state with the lowest income threshold, a family of three can earn no more than $ 1,416 a year to qualify for Medicaid. The coalition, called the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said its plan to expand the Medicaid program and improve benefits would cost $ 13.2 billion to $ 28 billion above current Medicaid expenditures, with most of the additional cost borne by the federal government. `` We are placing before the people a tough statement that there is an unmet need; it is well documented; the program is falling substantially short _ it covers fewer than half the poor in the country _ and that's going to have to fall to government,'' <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> said. `` New resources have to be made available because we have a system that's crumbling.'' In fiscal 1988, the federal government spent about $ 30.5 billion and the states spent about $ 20.5 billion on Medicaid. The coalition proposes to: _ Establish a standard benefits package states would be required to provide That would add $ 6.5 billion for a `` median'' package and up to $ 21.5 billion for a package that included more services. _ Set income eligibility for the program at no less than the federal poverty level, and require eligibility for those with incomes above the poverty level who have extraordinary medical costs _ Raise reimbursement rates for physicians and hospitals at least to the level of Medicare rates, which would cost an additional $ 4.4 billion Reimbursement rates have dropped so low that at least a quarter of the nation's physicians do n't treat Medicaid patients. Raising rates would `` encourage greater participation by health-care providers and more frequent, appropriate visits by patients to physicians' offices for preventive care,'' the group said. The report by the coalition, which represents both business and labor interests, stayed away from any recommendations on requiring employers to provide health insurance to their employees. Without such a requirement, some employers who now provide insurance coverage for employees who would be covered by the expanded Medicaid program might drop the private coverage, potentially adding more than $ 5 billion to the cost of the expanded program. However, the coalition noted that requiring employer-based health insurance for all employees and their dependents would provide coverage to 5.6 million uninsured workers below the poverty line. That would reduce the cost of the expanded program by an estimated $ 4.6 billion, the group said. Currently, some 35 million Americans have no health insurance. The Health Policy Agenda for the American People was organized in 1982 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> pays for most of the work of the coalition, which is composed of 172 groups representing business, labor, consumers, the elderly, children and health-care providers.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says he's looking for men and women who are n't afraid of hard work and have good sense <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees Thursday that he has interviewed `` a lot of outstanding people in the last 30 days'' for jobs in the federal agencies he oversees. `` I feel good about the quality level, talent level that we're going to be able to assemble here,'' he said `` If we can just get cleared through the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s office of personnel, we may eventually get them on board.'' Appointments to scores of high-level posts within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are being held up for clearances and other paperwork associated with the changeover from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. The No. 2 job in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is still being performed by Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. `` One of the questions I have asked every one of these people is how hard they're prepared to work, because if they come, they're going to work awfully hard, probably a lot harder then they've ever worked before,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said He added: `` I also want them to work smart. Working hard is one thing, working smart is another, and we're going to try to find people who will work smart, too.'' Only a few minutes before his brief remarks to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> got his marching orders from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a formal swearing-in ceremony. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to help `` make sure our objectives in agriculture are achieved'' as the new administration pursues the longtime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal of reducing world trade barriers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s name `` rhymes with fighter'' and that he is `` tough as nails, knowledgeable _ that's why I picked him. And I know he's going to fight hard for farming, for fair trade and for all the other important responsibilities for this department.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, 58, who holds degrees in law and economics, is a farm native of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and has held many public and private posts, including <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> service in the early 1970s and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> from 1978 to 1985. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had an `` outstanding tenure'' for 3 -LCB- years as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trade representative. He said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> will work closely with <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, the new trade representative, to help protect the interests of American farmers during multinational trade talks. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was confirmed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 8 and was officially sworn in as secretary without ceremony later the same day at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

Officials said Thursday it was the largest January feedlot placement since 1974. Marketings of `` fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.67 million head, down 5 percent from a year ago and down 7 percent from two years ago. As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year earlier in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> showed an increases. The seven states produce about three-fourths of the nation's beef. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration flunked its first world trade test by caving in to pressure from abroad and cutting back on duty levels for imported sport utility vehicles and vans, critics say. At issue was a decision Thursday in which the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scaled back a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ruling and said only some foreign-made sport utility vehicles and vans will be reclassified as trucks. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in January had said it would classify all the vehicles as trucks, upon which a 25 percent duty is imposed, rather than as cars, subject to a 2.5 percent duty. After Thursday's reversal, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmakers and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from auto-making states said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration let itself be swayed by foreign lobbyists. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration clearly caved in to pressure from the Japanese,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` This decision hurts <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ it costs us money and jobs. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s other senator, Democrat <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, saw it the same way: `` In its first major action on trade, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has put the wrong foot forward.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents domestic carmakers, said the original ruling to boost duties had been the correct one. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ought to decide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade practices, not foreign manufacturers,'' the association said. Foreign automakers were more conciliatory, but said none of the affected vehicles should be subject to 25 percent duties, which they characterized as a new tax by the `` no-new-taxes'' president. They also raised the specter of higher sticker prices on both imported and domestic sport utility vehicles and vans. Toyota Motor Sales <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> congratulated <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> `` for courage in the face of massive political pressure from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'' but said none of the vehicles should be classified as trucks. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartsch </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> ruling `` reduces but does not eliminate the economic harm brought by the tax.'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Segall </PERSON>, speaking for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling `` probably will mean overall more expensive sport-utility vehicles being imported, which will be followed by more expensive domestic sport-utility vehicles.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, characterized its decision as a technical matter based on `` legal classification issues'' rather than a reflection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy. Under past policy, the vehicles sometimes were considered cars and sometimes were classified as trucks, depending on whether they were fitted with back seats and other amenities. Forty-four percent of the 239,000 affected vehicles imported last year were classified as trucks. Under the plan announced Thursday, four-door sport-utility vehicles will be classified as cars and two-door models will be considered trucks. Vans will be considered cars if they feature rear seats, rear windows and rear doors. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials said that had the same policy been in effect last year, 66 percent of affected vehicles would have been classified as trucks, bringing in another $ 83 million in duties.

 The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressional delegation showed its liberal colors and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was the most conservative state in 1988, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. A lawmaker with a rating of 100 percent is one who voted in accordance with the position of the conservative group in all instances. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> the average score was just 3.69. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, it was 97.3. Based on its selection of 22 key votes in the two chambers, some of which the group gave double weight, the <ORGANIZATION> ACU </ORGANIZATION> said both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted more conservatively in 1988 than in 1987. The average House rating went from 37 percent to 44 percent, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> average went from 40 percent to 43 percent. In both chambers, however, the move to the right was made easier by a lack of confrontation over tough budget issues last year, due to the 1987 budget summit, the group said. Last month, the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group, released a similar survey and declared that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had become more liberal. The differences occur because the two groups base their surveys on different vote lists. However, the surveys do highlight the ideological differences between the parties. The <ORGANIZATION> ACU </ORGANIZATION> said four senators and 38 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, all Republicans, scored 100 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION> last month gave two senators and two dozen <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, all Democrats, 100 percent ratings. The conservative group in its rating gave double weight to votes on three issues: aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the override of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the Grove City civil rights extension bill, and a vote on shifting $ 100 million away from the Star Wars missile defense system.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to detain Central American refugees in a `` tent city'' on isolated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> brushland while their applications for political asylum are processed, congressional officials say. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said Thursday that there had been `` no public disclosure'' of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plans for handling the flood of refugees and that the issue was still under review. But Capitol Hill officials disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan to pitch tents on land adjacent to a minimum-security federal detention center now being used to process the refugees' applications Rep. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a statement that the tent camp would meet basic human necessities of adequate housing, food and sanitary conditions. More than 2,000 refugees from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are crossing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally every week, most of them coming across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, officials say. Treatment of the refugees by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has sparked a lawsuit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> on Jan. 9 blocked an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> policy that had barred asylum-seekers from traveling beyond the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> while their applications were pending. Under the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> policy, many of the refugees had been relegated to squalid squatters' camps lacking basic sanitation and other amenities. A congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hopes word of the tent-city detention center quickly reaches <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and discourages more amnesty-seekers from coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials contend that many are seeking only to better themselves economically and are not actually fleeing political repression. Advocates for the refugees say many INS decisions have been politically skewed because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is unwilling to admit the extent of repression by Central American governments allied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to keep the refugees in tents near the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, the congressional officials said.

<HEAD>Arab World Takes Economic Road To Unity, Using Common Market Model</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two new Arab economic pacts being forged this week show a shift from the grandiose unity plans that once sowed hope, suspicion and conflict throughout the Arab world. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> born Thursday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maghreb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> under discussion in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> reflect modern economic concerns, including reduced trade barriers and the opening of internal markets. Their model is closer to the European Common Market than the ill-fated <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> that joined <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> as a single nation from 1958 to 1961. Dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity proposals have been born and died since the region gained its independence from European powers after World War II, frustrated by the borders dividing people with a common language and common culture. Many tried in a stroke to sweep away the frontiers, physically unite armed forces or unify foreign policy. Virtually all efforts failed, victims of internal rivalry, external interference or shifting political tides. But like the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, the new groupings have a political impact. They have divided the Arab world into three main economic blocs: the six-nation <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the five-country Maghreb Union stretching from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. If successful, the new groupings will give their members access to wider markets that should make their farms and industries more efficient and enhance their bargaining power in the world economy. It might also be easier for the three blocs to reach effective agreements on economic cooperation than it has been for the 21 individual Arab countries. The Gulf Cooperation Council, formed in 1981, evolved into a military and olitical alliance under the threat of the Iran-Iraq war. While the leaders of the new <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> deny plans to form a military bloc or a political alliance, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> already cooperate militarily in some ways. They also include two of the Arab world's strongest military forces _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> _ as well as one of the best trained, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Several of the leaders have acknowledged their economic cooperation has political implications. Their charter said they acted in part to enhance `` pan-Arab security against current or future threats.'' But while they have left the door open to other states, the union will arouse apprehension in other quarters. Syrian leaders can not enjoy watching Jordanian TV reach into Syrian homes with celebratory broadcasts of singers lauding <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as `` <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> the Joy.'' They remain deeply at odds with both <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which have tightened their embrace of a Syrian friend, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The union adds to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s isolation, already aggravated by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> support for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, where fighting was halted Aug. 20 under a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s reintegration into the Arab fold after years of estrangement following its 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The new council also helps cement <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to the Arab world. But the political clout of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will be limited by economic difficulties faced by all four countries, as well as by outside interests all still maintain. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> particularly look to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for economic aid and can ill afford to alienate it. The new agreement ties <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries lying to the west, but <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> is counting on money from its southern gulf neighbors to help finance post-war reconstruction.

<HEAD>Cities with Polluted Air up 41 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Air pollution last summer was the worst of the decade and the number of cities where ozone exceeded federally approved levels jumped 41 percent, according to preliminary federal figures. `` This new information shows the clear fallacy in industry arguments that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s air pollution problems are solving themselves,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who made the figures public on Thursday A year ago the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> listed 68 cities that had recorded peak ozone levels considered unsafe under federal standards. Last summer the number jumped to 96 metropolitan areas plus two areas considered to be rural. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and environment, chaired by <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, had requested the data from the federal agency. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the data were only preliminary and had not been thoroughly analyzed. But they acknowledged the findings indicate a significant increase in urban pollution in 1988 and suggested that when the final numbers are evaluated from all monitoring points the number of cities where pollution exceeds federal standards could exceed 100. The preliminary data submitted to <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s subcommittee show peak daily ozone pollution levels last summer were on average 5 percent higher than in 1983, which had been widely regarded as having the worst ozone pollution this decade. Last summer's levels of ozone, a key component of smog, were on average 14 percent greater than those in 1987. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> called the data startling enough to affect the congressional debate on how to strengthen federal air pollution laws. `` I expect this data to give a strong boost to congressional efforts to establish long overdue new pollution control requirements for the automobiles, factories, power plants and other pollution sources which contribute to the urban smog that now afflicts almost every American city,'' said <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s subcommittee has scheduled a hearing later this month on the health impact of the air pollution. He said the latest <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> data indicate that more than 100 million Americans now live in cities with levels of ozone or carbon monoxide pollution than exceed what the federal government considers safe. Ozone pollution, caused by a variety of emissions from cars and trucks as well as industrial plants and factories, causes coughing and chest pains and has been linked by some scientists to permanent lung damage. According to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> findings, two-thirds of the agency's 323 monitoring sites reported higher ozone pollution levels last summer than in any other summer this decade. The information, which was collected by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from state and local air pollution control agencies, covered the period from April through October, 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> suggested that the hot summer contributed to the ozone problem. The additional areas that were classified in 1988 as exceeding federal ozone pollution levels were: <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Falls </PERSON> and adjacent <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, all in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state; <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, Reading, <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, all in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> and adjacent <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, all in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, La.; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>.; and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 80-year-old porcelain doll that lay forgotten in a nurse's attic was sold for a record $ 159,000, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction house said. The 21-inch German-made bisque doll _ a red-haired, blue-eyed girl in a pale blue dress _ is one of only 10 of its type made by <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>, the auction house said Thursday. The buyer was described only as a Madame <PERSON> Vierny </PERSON>, a Frenchwoman planning to open a museum of childhood in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The same woman bought the previous record-making doll, a 17th century wooden doll that fetched $ 107,000 in March 1987. The unidentified owner is a nurse from <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s said had played regularly, and rather roughly, with the doll through her childhood, even pushing it around in a doll carriage with her dog. Just before Christmas, the nurse cleared it out of her attic with other dolls she had collected and took it to be valued, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said The auction house had estimated its pre-sale price at $ 26,550 to $ 35,400. Another toy, a clockwork battleship, also sold Thursday for $ 70,092, a record for a tinplate toy. The hand-painted model was made in 1904 by a German firm, <PERSON> Marklin </PERSON>. The previous record was $ 49,649 paid at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in 1984 for a tinplate train, also made by <PERSON> Marklin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Report: US Lacks Merchant Ships to Support War Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government should spend $ 13 billion over the next decade to provide enough commercial ships for massive troop and equipment movements should war break out, a special maritime commission says. Despite that figure, the real cost to the government would be about $ 5.7 billion because of the tax revenues generated by the new ships and facilities, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said. The commission presented its proposals for legislative and private action to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday, but its chairman, former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no commitment to seek the funds. The commission's proposals include a package of legislation aimed at adding 244 ships that could be used to meet military needs. Some of the ships would be built abroad to allow shippers to become more quickly competitive internationally, the report said. Another commission member, retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said the country probably has only 70 percent to 80 percent of the commercial ships that might be needed in an emergency. `` If a crisis erupted someplace around the world, we do not have enough ships under the American flag to support a planned operation,'' <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said the maritime defense issue has not been critical in the past because it was assumed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies could provide ships if necessary. But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to `` go it alone,'' such as it did for a time in protecting <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shipping. Troops and supplies likely would be available, he said, `` but we do n't have the sealift to move them.'' In addition to increased ship building, the commission recommends adding 8,208 mariners, improving ship repair yards, countering unfair foreign trade tactics against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maritime industry and making several reforms in laws affecting the industry.

There were no knockdowns in the courtroom, but <PERSON> Tunney </PERSON> won a clear verdict over <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> from a historical judge on Wednesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces are due in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> this weekend to begin overseeing the nation's transition to independence after 74 years of South African rule. Commissioner <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police unit that will monitor <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s national police force, was to arrive today in that country, said <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Fanning is to hold weekend talks with Namibian police officials, <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said Thursday. Namibian police, which includes some South African officers, will remain responsible for civil order but will be supervised by 500 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police officers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> move into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> follows the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s unanimous adoption of a resolution Thursday authorizing <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, since it captured the territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War I. Early next week, Gen. <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON> <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON>, the commander of the military peacekeeping contingent, will arrive with more administrators, said <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> set April 1 was set as the date to begin the one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to an independent, black majority-ruled nation. They also approved a report by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that calls for sending 4,650 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military peacekeepers, 500 police supervisors and at least 1,000 civilian election monitors to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have not yet worked out which countries will provide personnel for the peacekeeping force, but for the first time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has offered to send up to 20 election monitors, said an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has estimated the effort will cost $ 416 million in its first year, making it the biggest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mission since the Belgian <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> operation of 1960-64, which cost more than $ 400 million and involved 19,828 soldiers at its peak. The General Assembly on Thursday approved funds for a 70-man team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers who will monitor the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> becomes independent. That group was budgeted at $ 9.2 million for this year, and a total of $ 19.4 million during its entire 31-month mandate of overseeing the Cuban withdrawal. In December, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed accords at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters pledging their cooperation with a southwest African peace plan that includes the Cuban pullout and Namibian independence. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused to relinquish control of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> without the withdrawal of the Cuban troops, saying their presence just over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern border could intimidate voters during the independence process. All Cuban troops are to be out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by July 1991. Cuban troops have been in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at that country's request since 1975 to defend it from attacks by South African troops and the U.S.-backed rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Liberation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narcotics committee's report on drug use says the problem will become even graver without greater international cooperation. Citing an increase in cocaine-related deaths last year, the report said, `` With the continued influx of cocaine into this country, the prospects for any change in this situation in the near future are not promising.'' The report by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> added that current estimates of the scope of drug abuse may understate the problem. `` Without a concerted international commitment, including a hemispheric drug summit, and without increased resources at home, the future picture is bleak,'' Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Thursday. The report said indicators showed an increase last year in coca and cocaine production and trafficking as well as greater opium and marijuana cultivation, despite reports of stepped up eradication efforts in some countries. The report catalogued a substantial haul of narcotics intercepted by federal agencies on their way into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but noted official estimates that the amount intercepted represents no more than 5 percent to 15 percent of what comes across the border. `` Despite the best efforts ... drugs continue to flood our borders because of bumper crops in producing countries,'' the report said. It said that `` the influx of drugs places a significant burden on federal, state and local law enforcement efforts.'' The panel also estimated that 6 million to 6.5 million Americans need drug abuse treatment and said there are 1.1 million to 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers. Currently, however, there are only about 250,000 treatment slots, according to the committee. It said about 148,000 are for intravenous abusers. `` Long waiting lists are common in many areas,'' it said. `` Moreover, there is no measure of those who are discouraged from even applying.'' The panel said hospital emergency rooms recorded 1,696 cocaine-related deaths last year, up from 604 such cases in 1984.

<HEAD>High-Rise Cats Survive Falls From Condos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One small step for a cat can turn into a giant leap when the feline lives in a high-rise, but a surprising number of the animals survive such falls, veterinarians say. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>'s fluffy brown Himalayan two years ago took the plunge _ a 300-foot fall down 24 floors at a condominium in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area _ and today is alive and well. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> suffered no fractures, according to <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenzer </PERSON>, who treated the feline for an internal injury. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> veterinarian, said split palates and broken jaws are common because the cats land on their feet and as their bodies hit, chins hit the ground. Their survival also seems to have a lot to do with heavy landscaping and the `` terminal velocity'' factor. Because of their weight and shape, cats fall at a top speed of 60 miles per hour. Humans fall as fast as 120 mph. `` They're pretty incredible creatures,'' <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON> said. Veterinarian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> says the cats often take a leap because of taunting by birds. `` The cat's out on the terrace,'' he said. `` There are birds out on the terrace. The cat leaps at the bird. The bird flies away. The cat keeps going. `` The cats are not that stupid,'' he added in their defense, `` but they are instinctive hunters.'' Studies have been done on cats with High Rise Syndrome. In a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> study of 132 fallings cats, a mixed breed named <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> took the record by surviving a 32-story fall to a concrete sidewalk. She chipped a tooth. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON>, who may have the local record in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, apparently was cushioned by trees when she fell. She was conscious and dazed, but quite alive, when her owner rushed downstairs. `` We decided the cat really may know how to fly,'' Ms. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators should `` unleash'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications companies in the world marketplace but keep a tight rein on the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Thursday that the Bell companies that were created in the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T are monopolies and should be regulated as such. To allow them into the long-distance and manufacturing arenas, as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the courts are considering, would turn back the clock on the post-1984 gains such as lower equipment prices, lower long-distance rates and more widespread use of telephones, he said. The Bell companies could potentially `` do a lot of damage to competitors'' in markets currently protected by the 1984 consent decree, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` If that happens,'' he said, `` the force of antitrust law will be blunted. Competition may wane and consumers may suffer.'' He said that under the decree, which prevented the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies from manufacturing equipment or providing long-distance or information services, `` suppliers have flourished, spurred by the knowledge that the -LRB- regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies -RRB- have no ` inside' manufacturer with an ` inside' track. Allowing them to manufacture would not improve the nation's trade deficit or create new jobs, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The regional companies would be inclined to go overseas to buy critical switches for phone equipment because of the high costs of developing their own, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` To get into this business would mean alliances between the -LRB- regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies -RRB- and switching companies in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> debates the regulation issue, foreign competitors are racing ahead, thanks to government subsidies. He said he was n't calling for subsidies but for the government to `` unleash the competitive information industry in this country.'' `` Regulators need to act, where they are clearly free to do so, to enhance rather than hinder the competitiveness of American business,'' he said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who assumed the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T chairmanship last April, said there should be less regulation in competitive marketplaces such as long-distance calling, where about 500 companies, including <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, are battling <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. `` In the competitive part of the industry, regulators have been slow to remove restraints. This has denied the nation the full benefit of all competitors being able to compete flat out. And this, in turn, penalizes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when it needs the very best technology to succeed in a time of intense international competition,'' he said. `` Divestiture worked,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup. `` It promised protection of consumers by driving a clean wedge between the monopoly markets and the competitive markets.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T now was just one of many communications networks in the nation. He said it was unfair that it be regulated in a competitive marketplace while leaders in other industries, such as computers, are not. `` One is overly restrained ... the other is not restrained at all,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A black firefighter who was airbrushed out of a photograph in a union's newsletter can sue the group for emotional distress, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge has ruled. The omission of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> from the August 1987 photo did not amount to a statement that was libelous or portrayed him in a false light, said Judge <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, dismissing those two counts of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s suit. But in the ruling Wednesday, <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could sue Firefighters Local 798 and two members involved in the newsletter for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which requires proof of `` outrageous'' conduct. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was one of several <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> firefighters honored for a rescue effort. The photograph in the union's newsletter, Mainline, was altered to remove <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the only black and only non-union member in the group. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firefighters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a separate organization. In his suit, he said the omission caused him humiliation and stress that kept him off the job. The incident happened within a few months of the discovery of a swastika in an office used by two minority firefighters, and the manhandling by whites of an officer involved in a department training program for women and minorities. Those episodes were cited by a federal judge who pronounced the Fire Department `` out of control'' in January 1988. Shortly afterward, Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON> resigned and was succeeded by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Postel </PERSON>. The union apologized to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> over the photograph but said he was omitted only because he was not a member of the union, which has some minority members. `` I have a hard time accepting the idea that a union or any other organization has a duty to publish pictures of non-members,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, a lawyer for Local 798. `` Even if the person does feel left out, there should be a privilege that says the organization is free to grant publicity to its members.'' He said the union would make another attempt to dismiss the emotional distress claim before trial. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the suit would be redrafted to try to reinstate the libel and `` false light'' claims.

<HEAD>Fungicide Forbidden on 42 Fruits and Vegetables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is forbidding use of the fungicide Captan on lemons, potatoes, soybeans and 39 other crops, but other favorites such as apples, grapes and onions are among the two-dozen foods exempt from the new rule. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in its announcement Thursday that it decided against an outright ban, such as it had proposed in 1985, because `` the benefits of some uses of Captan outweigh the risk from dietary exposure.'' Where it may continue to be used, the risk of a person getting cancer from such exposure is less than one in 1 million, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that about 10 million pounds of the chemical is used each year. Captan was classified by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> as probably causing cancer because exposure to the chemical had caused laboratory mice and rates to develop tumors. Some environmental groups have urged the government to ban the chemical altogether and expressed disappointment in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` We are now telling people to wash their fruit and write your congressman,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hind </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> began looking into the possible dangers of <LOCATION> Captan </LOCATION> in 1980 and suggested four years ago that the risk of cancer is significant enough that a ban might be warranted, But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s acting deputy administrator, said Thursday that studies since 1985 have shown the health risk to be considerably less than once thought. `` We are looking at theoretical lifetime cancer risks that are 100 to 1,000 times lower than we previously projected,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the agency's decision to allow continued use of <LOCATION> Captan </LOCATION> on some food products `` is based on data which are a more realistic reflection of the actual residues of this pesticide found in the diet.'' Officials said the exposure estimates used four years ago were based on an assumption that 100 percent of each crop received maximum exposure to the chemical.

<HEAD>Report: Sub Intrusions Continue Off Sweden</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign submarines probed waters off <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> last year as often as before, but appeared to back off after Swedish forces fired at a suspected intruder, the military said in its annual report. The eight-page report that was released Thursday said, `` In spite of a number of observations, technical indications and well-coordinated action by anti-submarine warfare units, we have no evidence of the nationality involved.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was singled out in a secret appendix to the report submitted to Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s government. The Soviets have denied sending submarines into Swedish territory since 1981 when a vessel washed onto the rocks outside a major Swedish naval base. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> called that incident a mistake. Supreme Commander Gen. <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON> told reporters the military had some ideas about the identity of the intruders, but not enough to warrant diplomatic action. Naval commander Vice Admiral <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuback </PERSON> told a military seminar last month there was little doubt the intruders were Soviet vessels. `` They ca n't come from anywhere but hidden bases in the Baltic, and we know Western countries have no such bases,'' he said. <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON> said there had been a drop in the number of intrusions since late last year when `` the one who is violating our territorial waters began to act more carefully'' after the government fired on the suspected intruding sub last June off the coast. <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON> said the live-fire response followed government-aprroved guidelines established in 1987 to prevent intruders from escaping.

 Community activists say they are heartened by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to strengthen enforcement of a 12-year-old law forbidding loan discrimination against neighborhoods. The reaction Thursday followed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of a request by the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 11th largest, to purchase a small <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> bank. It cited <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s lackluster record of serving poor neighborhoods as required by the Community Reinvestment Act The law, passed in 1977, is aimed at preventing `` redlining,'' the practice of denying loans to an entire neighborhood based on the predominant race or economic class of its residents. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had previously granted merger requests on the condition that the banks applying did a better job of community reinvestment in the future, it had never denied an application. `` We hope this is the beginning of a trend,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishbein </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based group concerned with housing and community development. `` For a board composed entirely of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appointees, this is an unprecedented step.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, director of regulatory affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> appears to be trying to head off action in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which last year considered several measures requiring regulators to more vigorously enforce anti-redlining laws. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is letting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> know that the existing law is more than strong enough for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to take action ... and that means you do n't have to go through a significant restructuring'' of the act, she said. However, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said members of his panel were still very interested in toughening the law. `` The interest here is still ... intense,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s isolated and late awakening has to be viewed in the light of its prior compliance or lack of compliance. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s 14-month-old petition to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday, with board members <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> opposed. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did not vote. `` We feel that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has finally put teeth into the law,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, an international representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which had lodged a formal complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s application. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> `` never has done a good job of lending to the low-income and minority community of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' He described Grand Canyon as a `` boutique bank'' catering to affluent customers in suburban <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theobald </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` astounded and outraged'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. `` We have an excellent and always improving record of community support,'' he said. The central bank's 10-page majority decision said, `` Given <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s size ... -LRB- the -RRB- bank's participation in community development and redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory.'' It noted the bank has since developed a plan that should `` make substantial contribution to correcting the past deficiencies,'' but added, `` The board does not believe that commitments by themselves can serve as a substitute for the established record of ... performance.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also voiced concern about the bank's plan to expand while still financed in part by and subject to the control of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as the result of a 1984 federal rescue.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights organization accuses the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> of resorting to atrocities against Cambodian refugees that are `` chillingly reminiscent'' of policies blamed for more than 1 million deaths in 1975-79. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch, a private monitoring group, said nearly 100,000 refugees are virtual prisoners in camps in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> but controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the Marxist group that ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 into 1979. It said the refugees are subjected to torture, summary executions, forced labor, denial of food and exposure to mines and shelling. In the camps, `` policies that have made them international pariahs'' are again pursued by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch said in a 45-page report based on recent interviews along the border and news dispatches. `` Systematic human rights abuses ... and the determination to keep refugees away from the ` contaminating' influence of Western and international aid agencies are chillingly reminiscent of the barbarous practices that characterized <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975-79,'' it said. Marked by purges, starvation and depopulation of cities, those years became known as `` The Killing Fields'' era, the title of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> motion picture on the period. `` The international community must now insist that refugees in Khmer Rouge-controlled camps be allowed to choose whether they wish to remain in those camps or be transferred elsewhere,'' it said. The report was issued Thursday, on the eve of weekend diplomatic talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, aimed at ending the 10-year Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that ended <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch said recent <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> activities suggest a coming bid to regain power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> should be persuaded to crack down against the group. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, numerous human rights organizations, and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> governments participating in the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks all have declared opposition to a return of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control. The report said there is a danger that protection of the Cambodian refugees will be overlooked during fast-paced diplomatic activity on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> involving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` A change in Thai government policy is the first step,'' <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch said. `` International pressure on <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to establish and enforce international access to all refugee camps is ... essential.'' The Thais, seeking to use the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` as a buffer between the Thai military and Vietnamese forces inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, have acquiesced in the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to let civilians who wish to do so leave camps under its control,'' it said. But a new phase of the conflict, with prospects for Vietnamese withdrawal and solution of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s external problems, no longer justifies this, it added. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> depend on <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for food, arms and other logistical support. `` Weapons supply to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the transfer of these weapons across the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> should be terminated immediately,'' it said. `` It is clear from ... its efforts to stockpile weapons inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is preparing for a protracted war.'' <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch described teen-agers and women forced to carry weapons and ammunition from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> across heavily mined frontier zones into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, with heavy casualties, denial of medical care and abandonment of the crippled. Between last June and November, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> attempted to shift 15,000 refugees to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from widely separated locations in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, it said, indicating `` they were part of a central policy'' probably ordered by leaders <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ieng </PERSON> <PERSON> Sary </PERSON> `` who observers believe continue to be the primary decision-makers.''

 A former mental patient who killed three co-workers this week before committing suicide showed no signs of being potentially violent when he was released from the hospital in 1986, doctors say. `` I have found nothing that would make me question the release decision made two years ago,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, acting director of <ORGANIZATION> Clifton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state mental hospital. <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>, 33, described by police as `` a disgruntled employee,'' shot four co-workers, three fatally, and then killed himself Wednesday afternoon in the seventh floor offices of <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. Just a week before the shooting, a therapist who met with <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> every two weeks reported that he was adhering to the terms of his conditional release from the mental institution, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> officials, aided by outside consultants, are reviewing the incident, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said. Authorities says they have not determined the motive for the shootings or how <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was able to obtain a gun. The three bank employees who were killed were identified as <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, Md.; <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Md.; and <PERSON> Mahasty </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha-Khan </PERSON>, 29, of Silver Spring, Md. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 22, who was shot in the jaw, survived the attack but was listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Suburban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had been hospitalized for depression five times in his life, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said, beginning in 1979 in his native <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The first four hospitalizations were brief. But a county circuit judge committed <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> to <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> in April 1984 after he threatened a police officer with a dull butter knife and begged him to kill him, according to <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> records. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>, who was declared not criminally responsible for the attack, was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar syndrome, which caused him to experience extreme bouts of depression, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said. If anything, said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was considered a threat to himself, but not to other people. `` He was in for a suicidal gesture, not violent behavior,'' said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. A treatment team evaluated <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> in 1986 and deemed him ready for conditional release, a decision supported by an outside mental health professional and by the judge who had committed him. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> remained on medication and lived in several transition houses before eventually moving into an apartment in Silver Spring, according to <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. The bank was not informed of <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s psychiatric history because of what hospital officials considered his right to privacy, said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, who pointed out that state law does not require such notification. He said one person in 20 suffers from some form of bi-polar syndrome, and 99 percent never become violent.

<TEXT>
 The Customs Service has ordered closer scrutiny of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags from a Taiwanese company that suggested that its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers replace `` Made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'' tags with `` Made in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' The order followed complaints from American flag manufacturers and several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, assistant commissioner in <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that `` an alert has been issued to all ports to closely examine inspections from this importer,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Ming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. In addition, `` Customs is initiating an investigation to determine if markings have been changed after importation,'' <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. The label-switching possibility was raised by <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh </PERSON> in a letter it wrote soliciting business from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. `` We can realize why you need to lift off this label ... to prevent the resistance in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to import flags,'' the letter said. `` If possible, we suggest you cut off this label after you receive the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags your own brand name and Made in <LOCATION> U.S.A </LOCATION>. signs.'' The solicitation added, `` We can offer the labels too.'' <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> was among the lawmakers who received a copy of the solicitation as part of a complaint campaign by domestic flag makers. The office of Rep. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Staggers </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> said it forwarded the same complaint to Customs back in June, but was told it is very difficult to enforce the country-of-origin marking laws after items have cleared Staggers was author of legislation seeking to ban all imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags. That legislation died at the end of the last session, but the lawmaker is preparing to reintroduce it. Customs also has forwarded a copy of the Taiwanese flag solicitation to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which, if evidence of label-switching is uncovered, could go to court to stop the practice. In addition, if any domestic manufacturer could show it lost business to a label-switching competitor, federal law would enable the company to recover the lost profit and legal costs. If a packaged flag, complete with trim, pole, etc., contains more than half American-made components, distributors can legally strip tags that say `` Made In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>,'' `` Made In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'' or the like. But `` they ca n't say ` Made in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>' unless it's made in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, a special assistant for enforcement in the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>.

 Share prices reversed an earlier trend to close the week at a record high Friday, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged lower as dealers waited in anticipation of an American trade report scheduled for release later in the day. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 65.90-point loser the previous day, won back 89.81 points, or 0.28 percent, for 32,173.39 by the end of the trading week. In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 125.72 yen, down 0.61 yen from Thursday's 126.33-yen finish. It traded in a tight range of 125.50-125 .90 yen during the day Dealers said the market's main economic barometer suffered a late morning slump when it shed a minor 1.36 points after jumping over 100 points shortly after the exchange opened. The index again picked up steam in the afternoon session before finishing the week at yet another high. The previous record was set Wednesday when the Nikkei closed at 32,149.48. Dealers said market participants were refraining from making strong moves ahead of American trade figures scheduled for release by the U.S <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> later Friday, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> time. They expect the December trade deficit to total $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion, slightly lower from November's $ 12.5 billion, the dealers added. `` The dollar is a lot weaker than I thought,'' said a dealer with a major securities firm. `` It came under selling pressure once it broke the 128.00-yen level,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` If the trade deficit is over $ 12 billion, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is likely to weaken even more.''

<HEAD>Global Aviation Group To Study Airline Anti-Terrorism Measures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A worldwide aviation agency will study ways to screen radios, tape players and other seemingly harmless devices that could be used to smuggle a terrorist bomb aboard an airplane. The 33-nation council of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ordered the study the same day British authorities in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, said the bomb that brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was hidden in a radio-cassette player. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British aviation authorities requested the two-day session that concluded Thursday in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> following the Dec. 21 bombing over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. The council ordered its staff to investigate what measures could be taken to prevent further terrorist sabotage aboard aircraft, and said it will make those recommendations in several months to the 160-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the air affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The council condemned `` all acts of unlawful interference against international civil aviation'' and urged member nations to intensify their air travel safeguards. `` A concrete plan of action was agreed to by the members of <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION>, which was our goal,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said at a closing news conference. British <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> described the meeting as marking `` a new era of international cooperation to combat the terrorist threat in civil aviation.'' A resolution adopted by the council commits the organization to review whether more intensive measures are needed to detect sabotage devices, especially explosives. It urges quicker research and development on detection of explosives and on security equipment. The organization's staff also will be considering whether new steps are needed to increase the matching of passengers and their bags as a security measure, to consider the security problem of cargo, mail and courier services using passenger aircraft, and the issue of controlling access to airports. The staff also will be looking at the security problems posed by radios, computers and other electronic equipment in which explosives or components can be hidden. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, speaking at an earlier news conference Thursday after the announcement of the latest findings in the Flight 103 investigation, said, `` This is further evidence of the extent of this serious problem.'' `` To ban radios altogether would be a very drastic step,'' the British official said. He said, however, it is a question that may have to be considered. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, the outgoing administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said new guidelines were issued Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> announcement. `` The guidance is more a sense of vigilance than anything else,'' he told reporters. `` To be extra vigilant, possibly X-ray in two dimension to look for hidden cavities.'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that while passengers can expect their electronic equipment to be checked more rigorously, an outright ban on carrying them is unlikely. `` I have not asked for any banning of electronic equipment nor have I heard it,'' he said. The organization's staff also will be considering whether comprehensive screening of checked baggage and the screening or passengers and hand baggage need new standards or recommendations. The organization's president, <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotai </PERSON>, said he hoped that most points could be handled this year. The organization's general meeting is in September. `` We have to strengthen further our preventive measures,'' <PERSON> Kotai </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Slightly, Stocks Hit Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> dealers took to the sidelines today as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar shed ground against the Japanese yen, while active buying propelled the market's main economic barometer to another record closing. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues started with more than a 100-point surge at the onset of trading, but fizzled out toward the end of the morning after profit-taking by investors. By the end of the early session, the index, a 65.90-point loser Thursday, had shed a marginal 1.36 points. Led by active buying of large-capital issues, the Nikkei regained momentum in the afternoon session and managed to win back 89.91 points, or 0.28 percent, during the two hours of trading. It closed the week at 32,173.39 points, a record finish. The previous high was set Wednesday when the index finished at 32,149.48 points. In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 125.72 yen, down 0.61 yen from Thursday's 126.33-yen finish. It was traded in a tight range of 125.50-125 .90 yen during the day The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had opened at a lower 125.90 yen following losses in overseas markets, and one dealer said the dollar came under strong selling pressure after it broke the 125.80-yen level, which he described as `` a technical point.'' Speaking on condition of anonymity, the dealer added that movement of the dollar against the yen next week will depend on what the American trade deficit figure for December totals. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release the figure in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later today and many local economists have predicted it to be slightly lower than November's $ 12.5 billion. But `` if the trade deficit is over $ 12 billion, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is likely to weaken even more,'' the dealer said.

 The leaders of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> have signed a new alliance to improve economic ties. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, formed Thursday at a summit in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, `` yet another link in the chain of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> efforts toward integration,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> read the agreement aloud to a cheering crowd in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s Grand Festivals Square, the agency said. Also signing the 17-article accord were King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. Officials of the four nations have said the alliance is intended solely to improve economic ties and has no military or political purpose that would compete with the 22-member Arab League. They said it was similar to the six-nation <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and another bloc that may be formed in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>.

 A full-page newspaper advertisement calling on Episcopalians to take a stand against women priests gives a rallying point to people who are unhappy with changes in the church, one of the campaign's supporters says. `` We are letting people know that they do not have to go along with all this trendy stuff,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, rector of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> is a member of the Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> that gave a test-run Thursday to the ad in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. The ad was aimed at the diocese that last week consecrated Bishop <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the first woman bishop in the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION>'s 450-year history `` Episcopalians! Do Something,'' read the ad, which included a litany of demands, including the mission's belief that priests should be male. The ad asks readers to sign and return to the group a `` declaration of common faith and purpose,'' and encourages readers to attend a synod planned this June by the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based mission, a conservative Episcopal group. The ad was the latest note of discord sounded since <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was elected as bishop last September, a position that gave her entry into an apostolic succession that the church traces back to the time of Christ. At <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration as suffragan, or assistant bishop, two men spoke against the ordination, including one who termed it sacrilege. But the congregation of about 8,000 roared its approval when asked if their will was that she be ordained. The 58-year-old Episcopal priest from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has generated controversy because of her gender, her lack of formal seminary degrees, her divorced status and her tenure as former publisher of the distinctly liberal <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> publication, The Witness. Many church leaders saw Thursday's ad as no threat to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' position `` In one sense it's good copy and is a way for them to fly their flag,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, director of development at the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. Architects of the campaign say the ads will run elsewhere in the country this spring. <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brien </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> of the Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> said it is unlikely the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will reverse its 10-year policy of allowing women into the priesthood. But he said the June synod is intended to `` find a way to allow ourselves to live and breathe within the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Whether the official channels of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will tolerate that, I think that's really a great question right now.'' Officials of the 96,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> said they had no comment on the ad. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Solheim </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was aware of the ad and had no comment. At a news conference after her election had been formally approved by Episcopal bishops around the country, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> acknowledged that some church members would have difficulty with her position, but said she doubted a schism would result.

 Tens of thousands of Moroccans welcomed the leaders of five North African nations who are holding a summit to create a common market known as the Great Magreb. `` This union is only the first stage toward a union of all Arab countries,'' <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told leaders of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> at the opening session Thursday. They proposed to finalize their treaty today following prayers in <LOCATION> Marrakech </LOCATION>'s nearly 1,000-year-old Kotoubia Mosque. The outlines of the future union remain general, but summit sources said the leaders want the new union to enable their countries to hold their own in dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Thursday said the nations are realizing `` a dream that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> have had for generations.'' Outside the meeting in <LOCATION> Marrakech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, more than 20,000 people cheered the leaders. Col. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> announced that a second summit conference of what is being called the `` Arab Union of the Great Maghreb'' would take place in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, on Sept. 1. The day is also the 20th anniversary of the coup that brought him to power. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also hoped that someday `` other African countries, particularly <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'' would join the union. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has proposed integrating the defense forces of the five countries, but none of the other four summit nations has shown an interest in the move. Within the union, all goods would move freely, and there would be separate agreements on the free movement of their citizens, unification of currencies, and economic relations with the outside world. But each country would retain its national sovereignty. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the leaders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> signed an accord Thursday also to create an economic alliance, an official Iraqi report said. Their alliance, called the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, is designed to boost <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Government Acknowledges Stroessner's Police Had Torture Chambers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The new interior minister acknowledged that police under ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Strossner </PERSON> had torture chambers, but he said they would be dismantled soon, a newspaper reported. The comments by Gen. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> followed accusations in recent years by <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and human rights organizations that Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> used torture to repress political opposition. In an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> was quoted as saying his ministry would crack down on rights violations by police. `` We are going to eliminate torture chambers in police stations since they do nothing for the image of the country and are degrading to the human condition,'' he was quoted as saying. The interior minister declined to give details of the `` torture chambers'' but said they will be shut down, probably `` within a month.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was deposed Feb. 3 in a coup by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who named himself provisional president, appointed a new Cabinet, and accepted the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement for president in elections set for May 1. About 50 people were killed in the coup, the government said. Human rights groups said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s forces frequently used torture. After he consolidated power following a 1954 coup, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> eased up on the most blatant human rights violations, replacing murder and torture with harassment, detentions and expulsions, the rights groups charged. <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said members of the investigative police agency, which long has been accused of torturing political and criminal prisoners, will be prosecuted if formal complaints are lodged. `` We will investigate all the irregularities committed by employees of this ministry,'' he was quoted as saying. `` We're not going to cover up for anybody. ... Our mission is to clean up the image of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as being a repressive organ of the government.'' In a separate development, a judge ordered the release of a Chilean convicted of being an accomplice in the September 1980 assassination of exiled Nicaraguan president <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> was arrested in October 1980, 47 days after <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s car was blasted by a bazooka in a residential neighborhood of this capital city. `` I'm emphatic in saying I had no participation in that. I was a scapegoat of authorities in charge of the custody of <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> told reporters. `` The investigative police tortured me for almost seven months. They even tortured my pregnant wife in my presence, causing a miscarriage,'' he said. <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> was scheduled to be released in 1986 after being convicted and sentenced to six years in prison, but prison officials accused him of participating in a prison riot that January. Judge <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> decreed his release after a witness testified <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> was not involved.

<TEXT>
 Opponents of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benezir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> may be trying to undermine her goverment by using the rage of a novel that allegedly blasphemes Islam. The furor over `` The Satanic Verses'' caused the most violent demonstration in the Pakistani capital in a decade and occurred while Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on her first official trip abroad as prime minister. `` If the real purpose of the demonstration was only to protest the book, it came at an odd time and an odd place,'' said a retired bureaucrat who served under both Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, and President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, who overthrew <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in 1977. On Sunday, young Moslems following religious leaders and political opponents of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> marched on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a close ally of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, ban the book. A rock-throwing mob smashed windows, tore down the American flag and started small fires in the building. Police responded with tear gas and gunfire. Six people were shot to death and more than 80 were injured. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said the violence appeared to be the work of her political rivals and accused them of trying to whip up sentiment against the 2-month-old government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> already had joined <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in banning the novel. An editorial in The <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language newspaper that often supports the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> party, declared: `` The path of confrontation ... is being followed by people who either do not accept the democratic way of life or are not happy with the results of the general elections and now wish to destabilize the popularly elected government.'' Organizers of the protest said the timing had nothing to do with Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s absence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but was prompted by reviews of the book that appeared in international news magazines a few days earlier. A government official said privately: `` The reviews had the first details anyone had about the book. Nobody here has read the book.'' A religious issue could bring together followers of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who won the support of Moslem fundamentalist parties by espousing Islamic law for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The program had made little headway by the time <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was killed in a plane crash in August. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s political heirs ran in November's elections as the eight-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, with adoption of Islamic law as a major part of their platform. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has shunned Islamization as a relic of the <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> years. Her party, founded by her father, won the popular vote nearly 2-1 in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first free elections since the 1977 coup. It fell short of a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, however, and she formed a coalition with small parties and independents. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s lack of a majority has led to several confrontations with the conservatives, the most notable over her attempt to repeal a constitutional amendment <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> enacted giving the president broad discretionary powers. Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' offends their faith by satirizing the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as fallible and implying that Islam is not the only true religion. Author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen who was born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to Moslem parents, says the work is not blasphemous.

 A fire in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION> destroyed 3,900 buildings and left 22,000 residents homeless, official sources said today. There was no report on casualties or the cause of Thursday's inferno, which sources said caused an estimated $ 50 million damage Among the structures destroyed were two schools, three movie theaters, a section of a hospital and a government office building. The blaze broke out at 3 p.m. and lasted until midnight. <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION>, 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, is a prosperous business center with a wealthy Chinese-Burmese community. Several large fires have swept through <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s provincial centers in recent years, in part because many buildings are wooden.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has made a religious mistake in sending death squads after the author of `` The Satanic Verses,'' a leading Islamic theologian said. Executing <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> would be `` virtually impossible'' under the tenets of Islam and such a death order is `` a wrong ruling'' from a theological point of view, said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Al-Azhar </ORGANIZATION> institute. <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON> said Thursday that the book should be banned and burned, but that nobody has been executed in <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,350-year history as an apostate, which he interpreted as the crime <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> invoked in his death sentence. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said the Indian-born author deserved to die for insulting Islam. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born into a wealthy Moslem family in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, says he does not believe in `` supernatural entities'' but insists his book is not slanderous. The 1,013-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Al-Azhar </ORGANIZATION> is considered the Moslem world's center of theology, combining a university and mosque whose officials are appointed by the government <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s execution order and unrest in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the book's publication make `` Islam seem brutal and bloodthirsty,'' said <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON>. He said there are four steps to follow with someone suspected of being an apostate before passing a death sentence: _ A formal court questions the defendant on his motivation and whether his alleged offense was meant to signify rejection of Islam. _ Once held to be an apostate, the defendant is given a week to repent. _ Barring repentance, he is sentenced to death. The only authority enabled to pass such a sentence, however, is a Moslem ruler with jurisdiction over the defendant. _ Finally, if the defendant changes his mind and eventually repents at any time before his execution _ even the second before death _ he is absolved and released. `` So you see, it's really impossible to execute an apostate because the defendant will always repent,'' <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON> said. `` Whoever understands <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> will realize that the penalty for apostacy can not be implemented. In the history of Islam, there has never been any individual case of executing an apostate, only wars against them.'' He said he has not read the book but that <ORGANIZATION> Al-Azhar </ORGANIZATION> officials have received reports and excerpts from Moslem clerics in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Three years ago, anti-apartheid leaders launched a campaign to promote black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as `` the mother of the nation'' and a symbol of resistance to government repression. Since then, her image has been tarnished by controversies over her lifestyle, public statements and involvement with a group of youths who have been accused of crimes. In recent weeks, the wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been linked with alleged beatings of black activists, disappearances and the death of a 14-year-old boy. On Thursday, black leaders of major anti-apartheid organizations publicly abandoned and condemned her. They told of many attempts to reconcile the conflict between Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the black community, and said they were outraged by her `` complicity'' in abductions and assault. The government, which isolated and banned her for nearly 23 years, has run several TV news programs on her troubles. As far as the government is concerned, the most effective way of discrediting Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> may have been its 1986 decision to lift the ban on quoting her and remove all restrictions on her activities. The government has exploited Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s foibles in its propaganda war against her husband. But in many cases, she has provided the ammunition. Public reports of battles between her bodyguards and other <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> youth groups go back to January, 1987 when police questioned her about the death of one of the young men who congregate at her home under the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer team. She formed the team in 1986, saying the youths were getting into trouble and she wanted to get them off the streets. They have played few soccer games. For two years her name has been popping up in court cases involving charges of assault, murder and robbery by people alleged to have stayed at her house or used her car and van. Police occasionally have announced they were investigating charges against her, but have never brought her to court. Anti-apartheid newspapers sometimes delayed for weeks printing negative stories about her or her bodyguards for fear of being used in an anti-Winnie Mandela propaganda campaign. But journalists have grown increasingly uneasy about Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s refusal to comment on the events and her continued support of the unpopular <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, whose members have threatened reporters and photographers as well as residents of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. For years she was known as the courageous, stubborn wife of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, fighting small battles in the conservative farming town of <LOCATION> Brandfort </LOCATION> where she was banished. She received a steady stream of international visitors and issued statements on <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> that could not be published in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Her prominence soared in late 1985 after her <LOCATION> Brandfort </LOCATION> house was burned and she challenged the government directly by moving back to <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the largest black township. She had not been quoted in South African papers since 1975, but suddenly she was at almost every major rally, wearing <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colors, her fist raised, supporting the anti-government protests and making radical statements. The government, without explaining why, lifted the ban on quoting her shortly after she made one of the most controversial pronouncements of her life. At a rally in the township of <LOCATION> Kagiso </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said, `` With our boxes of matches, and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country.'' The exiled leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> disassociated itself from the statement. But her declaration was seen by the government as proof the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> supported the `` necklace,'' a burning tire around the neck that was used on suspected black collaborators. The <ORGANIZATION> Mandelas </ORGANIZATION> married in 1958, when she was a 24-year-old social worker and he was a 40-year-old executive member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. After the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was banned in 1960 and her husband went underground, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> spent 17 years under banning orders, in solitary confinement, on trial or under house arrest, while raising two daughters. In 1977, she was banished to <LOCATION> Brandfort </LOCATION>, where she started a clinic and day-care center. She returned to <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> amid the national uprising in black townships, breaking her bans on public appearances and speeches. She said she spoke for the nation's jailed black leaders and for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. Friends suggested police did not act against her because of the growing world focus on the <ORGANIZATION> Mandelas </ORGANIZATION> as a symbol of black resistance to apartheid. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said last week that police were careful not to be seen as vindictive toward Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. But he also said it was hard to get a case against her because witnesses who were willing to testify later changed their minds or disappeared. She has not been charged with a crime since December 1985 when she was accused of violating her banishment order. She was widely criticized for building a mansion on a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> hill, which she said was for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> when he left prison. Sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> sent word he would never live in the house, and it has not been occupied. She never spoke publicly about the burning of her house in July. Through his attorney, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said no retaliation should be taken against local high school students who had torched the house in a fight with her soccer team. Black leaders in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> formed a crisis committee after the arson to defuse tension and act as a conduit for complaints about the soccer team. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> became more isolated when she broke off contact with long-time family lawyers, argued with the committee and remained surrounded by her bodyguards. In September 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern about statements made by Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, noting she held no position in the organization. Celebrating the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s 75th anniversary, the organization issued a list of `` Heroines of the Struggle.'' <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was not on it.

<HEAD>Embattled Navajo Chairman Takes Leave of Absence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Navajo tribal chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has taken a leave of absence amid allegations that he accepted kickbacks, but it was unclear today who will lead the nation's largest Indian tribe <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s decision Thursday came a week after witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> demanded trips, gifts and other favors as a part of awarding contracts and other tribal business. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> real estate agent <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> testified on Feb. 7 that he helped arrange a Navajo ranch purchase in July 1987 for $ 33.4 million from an oilman who had paid $ 26.2 million for the ranch hours earlier. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who has been granted immunity from prosecution, said he gave <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> $ 75,000 and a luxury car as his share of the profit. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who acknowledges accepting gifts but denies wrongdoing, announced his intention to step down during an emotional speech to the 88-member Tribal Council. He appealed for tribal unity and asked for access to records to defend himself against `` slurs and slanders.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, 60, the flamboyant former aerospace engineer serving his fourth four-year term as chairman, failed to get the council to approve his chosen successor, Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The council then elected <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> as temporary chairman. Tribal lawyers were trying to determine today whether the council acted within the law in bypassing <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Standingbear </PERSON>, an attorney in the chairman's office, said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> should become acting chairman automatically under the tribal code. Council members gave the <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> a standing ovation as he left the meeting Thursday night. Earlier, people could be heard cheering outside the building when <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> agreed to take a leave. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has refused to answer a subpoena from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, which has denied him immunity from prosecution, or to discuss the allegations with non-Indians. In a Navajo radio broadcast, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> claimed the committee targeted him for his advocacy of Indian rights. He also said the committee is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty. `` We want to look back with pride with what we have done, and I ask you to let me leave and that you allow me to have retain effective legal representation. But I leave that to your wisdom,'' he said. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> also asked to be treated fairly. `` In the end, we come to the same circle and love each other because there is no way we can walk away from our clans,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and his running-mate <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> won office in November 1986 by a plurality of about 750 votes of more than 60,000 cast. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> had been out of office for four years and served three earlier terms. In 1977, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury failed to reach a verdict against <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on fraud and income tax evasion charges. An estimated 170,000 of the nation's 200,000 Navajos live on a 25,000-square-mile reservation that covers much of northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and extends into northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Working Group Agrees On Means to Legalize Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> praised a tentative accord that would legalize the banned trade union movement if it reaches agreement with communist authorities on other political and economic reforms. Government and Solidarity negotiators, in part of broad talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future, agreed in principle Thursday to amend the labor law so Solidarity can be registered immediately if the two sides agree on other reforms. `` That's a lot. That's a lot. That's great,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Solidarity has demanded a return to legal status after being banned in 1982. Later, Solidarity activist <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON> was allowed to appeal on television for people to start Solidarity organizing committees `` so there is a basis for legal existence of Solidarity later, because now we know it will happen.'' Officials announced the agreement after a session of a working group devoted to trade unions. Negotiators decided the union could be registered nationwide in one step under an amended labor law to be passed by the parliament. A resolution passed by the working group also said the new Solidarity would have freedom to create its own organizational structures, but would have to negotiate jointly with other existing unions during talks with management. Negotiators in a working group on youth problems said the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also should be legalized. It was the campus equivalent of Solidarity and was also banned in 1982. Government spokesmen have said since the talks began Feb. 6 that legalization of Solidarity must be part of a `` package deal'' with the opposition. Authorities also require agreement on a program of economic and political reforms and on `` non-confrontational'' elections this year, after which members of the opposition would assume a minority role in parliament. Solidarity had wanted to be legalized under a new act and not be bound by the 1982 labor law, which restricted how quickly a nationwide union could form. `` We agree together that the procedure of registration will be opened by a single legal act registering the nationwide trade union. That is such as Solidarity demanded,'' said journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who led the opposition delegation to Thursday's discussions The government side has stressed it is not agreeing to make legal again the old Solidarity, which it blames for causing social discord in 1981 that led to its banning following a martial-law crackdown. The government has said it will legalize a new union under the same name that would function differently. The broad-based talks with Solidarity has received unprecedented coverage in an official media in recent months. In another development, an official newspaper for the first time published evidence that implicates the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the massacre of thousands of Polish officers during World War II. The bodies of 4,000 Polish army officers deported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were uncovered by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army in spring 1943. Official Soviet and Polish histories had maintained the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed the officers in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians blame the Soviets. A confidential June 1943 report by the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> that appeared Wednesday in the weekly Odrodzenie -LRB- Rebirth -RRB- said: `` Judging by the papers found with the corpses, the murder took place in the months of March and April 1940.'' Because the site, 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, was at that time in possession of the Soviets, the report implied Soviet responsibility for the crime.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim To Capture Town Near Southern Provincial Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sudanese guerrillas today claimed they captured a heavily defended southern town, killing or wounding hundreds of government troops. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> said it had repelled a rebel attack in the area. A <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leader, <LOCATION> Lam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Akol </LOCATION>, refused to list rebel casualties in the battle Tuesday in <LOCATION> Liria </LOCATION>, near the southern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akol </PERSON> said `` about 75 percent'' of the 1,000 government troops defending <PERSON> Liria </PERSON> were killed or wounded. On Wednesday, the Sudanese army command reported a rebel attack on a military convoy on a highway heading northwest of town. The army statement said the rebels killed five soldiers and injured 14, but it claimed the army `` was able to inflict heavy losses on the rebels, who were forced to flee.'' There was no independent verification of the claims. <PERSON> Liria </PERSON> is about 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, which is a prime rebel target. Between <PERSON> Liria </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION> is the government-held town of <LOCATION> Ngalangala </LOCATION> and the White Nile river. `` We control 95 percent of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. We are interested in capturing the other 5 percent,'' <PERSON> Akol </PERSON> said. Rebels late last month captured the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nasir </LOCATION> after months of siege. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> is 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and 20 miles from the Ethiopian border. The rebel radio, believed to broadcast from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said the main rebel leader, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, led the attack on <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> was a Sudanese army colonel before he organized the rebel group in 1983. He launched the rebellion against the Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government to press for greater autonomy and economic reforms in the largely Christian and animist southern provinces of <LOCATION> Bahr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Ghazal </LOCATION>, Upper Nile and <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION>. In November, the rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> negotiated a peace agreement that was later rejected by Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government. The November agreement called on <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to lift the state of emergency, suspend application of Islamic law and convene a constitutional conference by Dec. 31. The rebels agreed to a ceasefire. At the time of the negotiations, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was a coalition partner in <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government. However, the party left the coalition after the government rejected the agreement. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> then reorganized his Cabinet, giving greater power to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which advocates Islamic law and opposes any agreement with the rebels. The reported fall of <PERSON> Liria </PERSON> came while a three-man <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegation was meeting with rebel officials in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` We were exploring the best ways of bringing about the agreement,'' <PERSON> Akol </PERSON> said. `` Ways to mobilize the people to force the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government to implement the agreement.'' <PERSON> Akol </PERSON> said the two parties did not discuss recent calls for a cease-fire by <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.

 A group of right-wing academics who believe black majority rule is inevitable have proposed creating an all-white, Afrikaner nation in a thinly populated section of western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, outlined details of the proposed nation Thursday that he said would include the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastline starting about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and extend 300 miles inland. The area contains no major cities, and much of it is desert. <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON>'s as-yet-nameless nation also would include the southern half of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but that South African-ruled territory is due to gain independence by early next year. His proposal contrasts sharply with the demand of a nationwide extremist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, for creation of a whites-only state consisting of <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, two of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s four provinces. Both provinces have vast farming areas and numerous gold mines, and <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> includes the major cities of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON> is a theologian and a former chairman of the Broederbond, a secretive society of influential Afrikaners. He is the son-in-law of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Verwoerd </PERSON>, who designed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system in the 1950s. <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON>'s proposal represents a reversal of the ideology of <PERSON> Verwoerd </PERSON>, who sought to relocate blacks in nominally independent rural homelands while whites controlled the bulk of the country, including the industrial centers, gold mines, ports and best farmland. <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON> contends establishment of a small, whites-only nation is the only way of ensuring the survival of the Afrikaners, the mainly Dutch-descended whites who make up about 60 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites. In a controversial policy document last year, <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON> said Afrikaners should abandon hope of dominating the entire country, where the 26 million blacks outnumber whites more than 5-to-1. `` Minority domination as currently practiced in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is morally unjustifiable,'' he wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government rejects the idea of a white homeland. It is struggling to find support for its concept of racial power-sharing, in which blacks would be brought into central government but would not be allowed to overrule white interests. <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON> said he envisioned a transitional period in which Afrikaners would move to the proposed white nation while it remained under South African control. He said infrastructure would be improved with government grants similar to those extended to black homelands. <PERSON> Boshoff </PERSON> acknowledged the area is dry, but suggested that the region along the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa-Namibia </LOCATION> border, could be developed for agriculture. `` A move to the area would change the lifestyle of people as they know it now, but they have a choice of staying in the fat of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and melting away or move toward a new beginning,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the first black man to serve as mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has announced his candidacy for another term in the office he left in 1981, although he concedes that victory could be costly. `` We're about to take one big reduction in income,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday as he announced his candidacy with his wife, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>, from the steps of City Hall. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Democrat, has been working as a partner in a Chicago-based law firm since he left office. Financially, he said, running for mayor is `` the single most irrational move of my life.'' Right now, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s only opponent is <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who has said he would n't keep all of the $ 100,000 salary approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> currently earns $ 65,000 per year. Young was elected mayor in 1981 when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was barred by the city charter from seeking a third consecutive term. Young is required to leave office under the same charter provision. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was first elected mayor in October 1973, defeating incumbent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Massell </PERSON> with 60 percent of the vote. In a brief campaign speech, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he committed himself to public service in 1968 because he wanted a `` more prosperous <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for all Atlantans.'' He identified the issues of his latest campaign as drugs, crime and assistance for elderly citizens. `` I have listened carefully over the years ... and people are asking for help,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` That's why I'm running for mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. I promise you help is on the way.''

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has joined a prominent law firm but kept open a possible mayoral candidacy, saying he is carefully considering running and is encouraged by the support he has found.

Still, he insisted at a luncheon with reporters that he was undecided about entering the race and viewed it as his responsibility to move with care. He said he was holding discussions to gauge if he had sufficient support. `` I'm continuing to explore the possibility of running for mayor,'' he said, adding that it was prudence, not indecision, that has led to his long courtship with the prospect. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a Republican, would face <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, former ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and heir to the <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> cosmetics fortune, in his party's primary. If he ran, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said, he would accept the city's voluntary spending limit of $ 3 million each for the primary and general election. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> has said he would not accept that limit and the public financing that comes with it. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> would have the power of his public profile as a successful prosecutor to counter <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>'s cash advantage.

<TEXT>
 Pan Am Flight 103 was downed over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> by a bomb concealed within a radio-cassette player that investigators believe was placed aboard the plane in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a British detective said. Investigators believe the explosive that shattered the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 on Dec. 21 was put aboard the aircraft in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the flight began, Chief Superintendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said Thursday. It apparently had been placed in the hold of aircraft as checked baggage. `` New positive lines of inquiry are unfolding,'' he told a news conference in this southwestern Scottish town where the jumbo jet crashed, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. `` While there is insufficient evidence at this stage to establish the identity of the person or group responsible for this dreadful crime, the progress made and the evidence obtained has been substantial,'' said <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, an investigator from <LOCATION> Strathclyde </LOCATION> police, a Scottish regional police force. Asked whether the investigation would point to a specific country, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said: `` It may.'' On Feb. 8, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported the bomb that destroyed the jet was hidden in a radio-cassette recorder and was traced to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. That report quoted unidentified investigators as saying the device was similar, but not identical, to one found earlier in the possession of members of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s extremist <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The group has denied involvement. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said the brand name of the radio-cassette player had not been established and would not say whether it was a pocket-sized device or a larger model. Nor did he say whether investigators had located the detonator. Anti-terrorist experts have said the explosive most likely used was Semtex, an odorless, highly malleable substance made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and known to be used by terrorist organizations. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said he was `` aware of some aspects of the explosive that was used'' but declined to elaborate. The discovery of the bomb's hiding place followed painstaking reconstruction of a baggage container from pieces _ some no larger than a table knife _ strewn over 40 miles of Scottish countryside. `` The reconstruction of the baggage container suggests that the explosive device may have been among the baggage from the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> flight,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. `` The particular bag which contained the device has not been identified at this stage, but there is the most detailed work under way with forensic assistance to achieve this identification. I believe this can be done,'' he said. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said the belief that <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> was the origin of the bomb was based on `` a balance of probabilities.'' Most of the 1,500 pounds of baggage in the container in which the bomb was located was checked in at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, and the rest was `` interline'' baggage from other points. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. At <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the New York-bound flight was changed to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor's office, which is coordinating the West German investigation into the crash, said of <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s statement on the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> connection: `` We have no knowledge about that.'' The most persistent claim of responsibility has come from an anonymous caller who has repeatedly told international news agencies it was the work of the Guardians of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian group. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported this month that <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> was the principal architect of the bombing. Last month, the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s organization was involved. In <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the 33-member council of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is meeting to discuss ways to better airline security in the wake of the bombing. A draft resolution co-sponsored by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> calls for improving technology of bomb-detection devices so they can detect plastic explosives. The resolution questions whether computers, radios and other electronic devices should be allowed aboard aircraft since X-ray scanners can not distinguish between concealed explosives and components of the devices.

 The West German government today expressed deep consternation over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and ordered its top diplomat back to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, the owner of the German-language rights to `` The Satanic Verses'' said today it would not publish the controversial book out of concern for the safety of the company's employees. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostafavi </PERSON>, was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today and warned that the death threat poses `` an encumbrance for German-Iranian relations.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s biggest trading partner and has more than 100 businesses with representatives in the Islamic republic. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government's warning was delivered to the Iranian envoy by foreign affairs secretary <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudhoff </PERSON> at the instruction of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> told reporters at a press conference. `` The deep consternation of the federal government over the death threat against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was conveyed,'' <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has also ordered the charge d'affairs in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. Foreign Ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plan to meet in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss the execution order issued by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> against the Indian-born British author of `` The Satanic Verses.'' The book has set off a furor in the much of the Moslem world, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has offered a bounty of up to $ 5.2 million for the murder of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Many Moslems claim that the book's portrayal of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, founder of the Islamic faith, as a philandering businessman is blasphemous. In a statement distributed to the news media, the prestigious Kiepenheuer und <ORGANIZATION> Witsch </ORGANIZATION> publishing company today explained its reasons for refusing to publish the book. `` We have decided not to publish the novel ` The Satanic Verses,' in order to not endanger the life and limb of the employees in the current situation,'' the statement said. The publishing firm owns the German-language rights to the book, and the decision means that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s work will not be available to readers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in their own language.

 A homeless man who read erudite publications by street lights and reportedly never asked for handouts was found dead on an <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> street, carrying $ 2,000 in his pocket. `` We all figured he was n't broke, he was just a broken man,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> DaVanzo </PERSON>, an electrician at a construction site near where <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON>, 46, was found dead early Thursday. <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON> had lived on East 66th Street in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for at least a year, storing his belongings inside a church, while his mother, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON>, who lives about 10 miles away in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, tried desperately to find him. Mrs. <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON> told a local newspaper she had hired a private detective at one point to try to track down her son, whom she said was a veteran receiving disability payments. She said she did not know he had been homeless until late Thursday, when police traced her through an identification card her son was carrying. When asked how she and her son, whom she had n't seen since 1986, became estranged, she said, `` It's a long story.'' <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON> had a bank account with $ 638 dollars in it at the time of his death, which apparently was due to natural causes, said <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. `` He also had $ 2,000 cash on his person,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said, adding that his source of income was unclear. He was known to area residents and merchants as `` Charlie'' and `` Philip,'' and stayed mostly on East 66th Street between <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and First avenues. `` He was a peaceful man. No one ever felt threatened by him,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, a resident of the block. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlian </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nepomucene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON> kept his belongings near a confessional and spent much of his time during the day inside the church. Only on extremely cold nights would he sleep in the church basement. Ms. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said that she and other neighbors tried repeatedly to get <LOCATION> Damattia </LOCATION> to go to a homeless shelter, but he always said he preferred life on the street. <PERSON> Tabassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Qureshi </PERSON>, who owns two newsstands on First Avenue near 66th Street, said <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON> was a regular customer who bought The Christian Science Monitor and The Wall Street Journal. `` I do n't know, maybe he had a share in something,'' <PERSON> Qureshi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DaVanzo </PERSON> said he sometimes saw <PERSON> DeMattia </PERSON>, who said he was an electronics engineer, read The Nation or Scientific American as he lay beneath his quilts. `` His shoes were always shined,'' he said. `` I guess there was something in his life he could n't deal with _ and it broke him.''

 The leader of the smallest faction fighting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> today said he dismissed his guerrilla commander and other senior officers for lack of discipline and disloyalty. The leader of the smallest rebel faction, <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, said he was taking over the military command of his <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. It was the latest in a series of internal disputes that have seriously weakened his force in recent years. He made the announcement to reporters covering the preparations for the second round of talks aimed at settling the war between <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas and Vietnamese troops who invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> 10 years ago. He said he dismissed Gen. <PERSON> Sak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutsakhan </PERSON>, the chief of the general staff and other officers after field commanders accused them of lacking loyalty and discipline. In <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will `` do its utmost'' to make the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks a success. But it quoted the unidentified spokesman as saying Thursday that the guerrillas demanded the dissolution of the pro-Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` in disregard of the realities.'' The guerrillas `` have no foothold'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and `` are losing support from the outside,'' the Vietnamese spokesman claimed, according to the dispatch. Conflicts already had surfaced in Thursday's preparatory discussions in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> for weekend talks that include <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the government it installed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The full talks to begin Sunday will bring together the leaders or foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the four warring Cambodian factions, and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. All parties involved say they agree that a future <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> should be independent and neutral. All endorse a government consisting of the four Cambodian factions and led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, a resistance leader. They disagree over who would supervise a general election. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> refused today to say how many troops his faction had, but Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> put the figure at 13,000. The group has been torn by internal power struggles and a weakened military position since a 1984-85 Vietnamese offensive wiped out all its major bases along the Thai-Cambodian border. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s group and that of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, with an estimated 19,000 fighters, are allied in the resistance coalition with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which has 30,000-40 ,000 fighters Some 60,000-70 ,000 Vietnamese troops remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ended a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime under which about 2 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from executions, famine and civil unrest. Many nations are concerned the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> may try to reseize power. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has promised to pull out by 1990, or by September if a political solution is reached.

 The Education Department's civil rights office strayed far from its mission of fighting racial discrimination during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, say Democratic investigators for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. A report by the majority staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adds that the prospects for revived enforcement under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are not yet clear. `` Whether the <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- accepts its responsibility and begins to execute the laws as originally intended will depend greatly upon the commitment of the incoming administration to civil rights enforcement,'' it said. The authors said they hoped the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would undertake a comprehensive review of the issues they raise in the report. Under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, they conclude, <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> was `` stymied by an administration which actively opposed the laws which were entrusted to it and took efforts to minimize the agency's potential impact.'' The current director of the agency, <PERSON> LeGree </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, is a holdover from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and it is not known whether she will stay on. In a letter published with the report, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> denounced it as `` replete with inaccuracies and misconceptions of <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION>'s role.'' OCR is in charge of enforcing statutes barring discrimination on the basis of race, gender, handicap, age and national origin in all federally funded education activities and programs. Democratic committee aides visited six of the 10 <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> regional offices between January and March 1988. They reported finding widespread mismanagement, a decimated staff and confusion stemming from lack of policy direction from the top. Specifically, they noted the following: _ <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> initiated 9,768 complaint investigations between fiscal 1981 and 1988, most of them related to handicap discrimination Only 15 percent involved racial discrimination _ `` a violation of its mandate'' since the office was created in connection with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. `` There was a clear perception among the regional office staff that certain issues were ` off limits' and could not be investigated. Most of the issues involved race discrimination,'' the report said. The report noted these developments: _ The number of full-time equivalent employees at <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> has dropped from 1,099 in fiscal 1981 to 820 in fiscal 1988 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget requests for the agency declined from $ 51 million in 1982 to $ 41 million in 1989. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decision, since reversed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, prompted <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> to close in whole or in part 674 complaint investigations and 88 compliance reviews The decision said only specific activities or programs receiving federal money were subject to federal penalties for discrimination. The problem was aggravated because the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no reliable way to trace money it had given to institutions or school districts. _ The administration forced <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> to process state higher education desegregation cases under court oversight in 105 days rather than the 195 days recommended by the federal court Cases were withdrawn or narrowed to accomplish this. _ Regional staff trying to cite schools for civil rights violations often were stymied by headquarters Of 112 draft `` letters of finding'' of violations submitted from January 1987 to June 1988, only seven were approved while 92 were resolved with a `` violation corrected.'' _ In many cases the `` violation corrected'' designation meant only that corrective action had been promised Little follow-up monitoring was done to assure actual compliance by school districts and universities. The committee staff said formerly segregated higher education systems `` must not be evaluated by a ` good faith'' standard, but must be held responsible for totally eliminating the vestiges of discrimination, ` root and branch.''' It recommended that <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> conduct more broad compliance reviews of systemic discrimination issues, particularly regarding race. And it urged the agency to submit expanded staff, computer and equipment needs to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in time for fiscal 1990 budget consideration. In her rebuttal, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> accused the committee staff of misrepresenting her agency's investigative and enforcement procedures, distorting statistical evidence and drawing unsubstantiated conclusions. She said <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION>'s emphasis on negotiations, as opposed to enforcement actions, has proven effective and averted the need for protracte proceedings in many cases.

 Can a middle-aged British housewife find happiness by fleeing her unresponsive husband, two self-centered, grown children and a dreary working-class existence in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>? That's the question `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'' attempts to answer in a surprisingly laugh-filled, two-hour monologue about the `` unused life'' of a woman who admits she has `` nowhere to go.'' The play by <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Booth Theater, is a deceptive little comedy Its sweetness and fun are readily apparent, primarily in the persona of its radiant star, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. But underneath the smiles lie a sadness and ache that give the play a special resonance. `` Why do we have all these feelings if we do n't use them?'' <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> asks. She does n't get much opportunity, particularly with her lout of a husband who does n't harass her as much as he ignores her. `` He likes everything the way it has been,'' says <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> about this man who wants his tea on the table at the same time every night. And she complies, even frying up an order of eggs and chips in front of the audience. For much of her life, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> has just accepted things as they are, particularly her relationships with her husband and children. `` Marriage is like the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' she philosophizes. `` There's no solution.'' Her good friend, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, offers her one, or at least an escape. It's a round-trip ticket to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> _ without her husband. Act 1 finds <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> debating whether she should go. Act 2 has her sitting on a Greek island and gazing at the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. In between, there are stories, homey ancedotes told with good humor and grace. She reminisces about her days in school when she hated everything, including herself, and about her reunion with an old school chum who has become a high-priced hooker. There are stories about her family, particularly her son who once played <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> in a Christmas pageant and improvised his way into a room at the inn. There are also stories about her affair with a Greek tavern owner, the man who finally makes her see her own worth. A lot of these ancedotes are funny, and director <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Callow </PERSON> lets the laughs build nicely. But the evening's chief pleasure consists of watching the ingratiating Miss <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> develop her character. The actress, best known to American audiences as the saucy maid <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> on public television's `` Upstairs, Downstairs,'' does n't just tell jokes; she uses them to build <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> into a credible human being who makes her sorrows as well as her silly behavior matter. British playwrights seem to be dealing lately with the unraveling of the female mind, manner and mores. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> plowed similiar territory in his `` Woman in Mind,'' seen last season off-Broadway with <PERSON> Stockard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> playing a hallucinating wife and mother. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did a similar turn recently on television's `` Masterpiece Theater.'' His `` Talking Heads: Bed Among the Lentils'' was a bitter, biting and achingly hilarious account of a provincial vicar's alcoholic wife, brilliantly played by <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'' is n't of that caliber. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> simply is not as complex a human being as <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s addled heroine or examined so unmercilessly as <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s forlorn subject. But because of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>'s tale of dreams deferred, of a life not acted upon until it is almost too late, arouses a lot of laughs, some sympathy and even a little regret. She makes you care for this woman who ca n't remember when her marriage stopped being good. In other reviews: <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> calls `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'': `` a one-person show that is actually a play ... a joyful, captivating piece of theater.'' In The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said, `` Audiences will adore <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> ... because she radiates the genuine, unpretentious vitality of a warm old friend giving us the real lowdown.'' However, he added, `` That Miss <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> captivates us with her honesty is all the more amazing given how frequently her vehicle seems contrived.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> wrote that, `` The play is more fantasy than realism ... and always <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> is a shade too cute to be true. Yet <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> has a way with a phrase. ... `` This is among the most entertaining evenings in town _ and both funny and touching as an added bonus.''

 The seizure of a Roman Catholic church by dissident Polish parishioners reflects a growing cultural clash between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church and a new wave of <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> official says. About 100 parishioners began occupying <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday because they want the Rev. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON> to remain. The priest, part of an exchange program begun with Polish church authorities, has been ordered to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The protesting parishioners claim their new pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON>, engineered <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>'s ouster because the latter was too active in the Polish community. They said <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>, who has been in seclusion since his removal, brought enthusiasm to the church, knitted together the old and young parishioners, packed the Polish-language Masses and started a Polish-language class for their children. The drama in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> has played out at other Polish parishes in recent years. In August 1987, 1,000 parishioners at a church in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> took to the streets to protest the transfer of one of their priests. A month later, Polish immigrants in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, picketed outside their church demanding a Mass in their native language. One top church official attributed these and many less strident flare-ups across the country to attitudes brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Poles weaned on a more politicized church and the Solidarity movement. `` It's two different world views,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zendzian </PERSON>, who directs the office for pastoral care of immigrants and refugees for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` You have a lot of people who were Solidarity members and they were able ... to mobilize quickly and make their feelings known,'' he said Thursday. `` We're more used to getting a committee and studying things. Our processes usually take a little bit longer.'' The parishioners in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> are vowing to occupy the ornate, 89-year-old brick church in a largely Hispanic neighborhood until Bishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> diocese, agrees to meet with them. They have maintained their vigil in shifts, their numbers swelling each evening to as many as 200. Most sit quietly in the candle-lit sanctuary, singing hymns and chanting prayers in Polish. Some drift to the back of the church, kneeling before an icon of the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> of Czestochowa, who is revered by Polish Catholics. Nearby is another icon of the Rev. <PERSON> Maximilian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON>, the Polish priest martyred in a Nazi concentration camp. Frustrated by the bishop's refusal to meet with them, two of the dissidents began a hunger strike Wednesday night. They vowed to remain locked in a confessional until their demands were met. A three-hour meeting Thursday night between members of the group and diocesan officials failed to settle the dispute. <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>'s five-year contract was terminated in December by joint agreement between Franciscan officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, according to church officials. The priest was removed in December without explanation. Diocesan leaders, who have said <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON> has the right to appeal his transfer, did n't comment on the dispute after Thursday's meeting. The dissidents, many wearing Solidarity buttons and ribbons with the red-and-white colors of the Polish flag, have made no attempt to disrupt the daily Masses that continue to be celebrated in both English and Polish. The group includes a number of former Solidarity members who came to this country within the last five years, including <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Debski </PERSON>, one of the hunger strikers. `` This situation is not only for our church, it is everywhere there are Polish people,'' said <PERSON> Debski </PERSON>, who was jailed for about five months as a leader of Solidarity in the Polish city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. Ironically, the event that precipitated the rebellion reflects efforts by the American Roman Catholic church to accommodate the needs of <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants, who say they feel closer to Polish priests than to American priests. About 70,000 Poles have emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1977, according to the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The number of immigrants peaked in 1984 and 1985, when about 9,400 came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in each year. <PERSON> Zendzian </PERSON> said the church set up the exchange program about a year ago with church authorities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to bring Polish priests to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>, the priest at the center of the St. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s dispute, was brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under a similar program operated by the Franciscan order, which is responsible for assigning priests to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s

<HEAD>Toshiba Says It Supplied Equipment For Suspect Libyan Plant</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> provided electrical equipment for a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> factory that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government suspects of producing shells for chemical weapons, a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> official said today. But the official said <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> thought the factory was a desalination plant, and acted only as subcontractor for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Steel Works, a frequent <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> customer. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Steel Works ordered power transformers and switching equipment for the plant from <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> in June 1985, and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> delivered the equipment to the company in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in December of the same year. The equipment is a key component of electrical power systems in virtually all factories, he said. `` We had heard that the equipment would be taken to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but understood that it would be used in a desalination project,'' the official said. But he said such equipment is normally examined by company employees after it is installed, and said <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> was `` still examining'' what happened when <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> employees checked the suspect plant. The results of that examination should be known next week, he said. The Japanese government determined in spring 1987 that a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, violated international trade rules by selling sophisticated milling machines to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that were capable of manufacturing quieter propellors for Soviet submarines. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> said then that it was unaware of its subsidiary's activities. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Steel Works has denied it helped construct a chemical weapons plant or provided any weapons-making products to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and said it only exported desalinization equipment and maintenance machinery for the suspect factory in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, a desert area near <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Officials from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade and foreign ministries also have denied any Japanese involvement in production of a chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Biologists spent almost a day in a driving rain, watching sea lions circle a floating cage before two ventured inside and were caught for what is intended to be a permanent return to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Both are being taken today to the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, just north of the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where one nicknamed `` Blue Eye'' was released Thursday, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` He scurried off into the water and headed out to sea,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. A second sea lion that, like <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION>, was captured Wednesday in `` Operation Goodbye'' died in captivity later that night while coming out of anesthesia, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. A fish ladder at the locks, the sole passage for salmon and steelhead to reach <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and upstream spawning grounds, has become a favorite feeding spot for about 20 sea lions, which migrate through the area from southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The relocation program is the sixth effort in five years of attempts to stop the predation, which has endangered an already fragile steelhead run. The dead sea lion, found to have a .22 - caliber bullet wound in the neck and a severe infestation of lung worms, was anesthetized so scientists could attach a radio transmitter to monitor the 550-pound creature's `` Using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that went along with studying them,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON>, a marine mammal biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said `` Sickie,'' as the creature was dubbed, probably was shot near the locks, possibly by someone frustrated by the failure of previous efforts to chase the sea lions away. `` I'm afraid we're going to see more and more shootings,'' he said. The bullet wound and lung infestation however `` may have compromised his ability ... to withstand the anesthesia,'' <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeble </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, which has monitored efforts to rid the locks of the sea lions and given tentative approval, questioned whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals. He also said he would prefer relocating the animals and marking them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters to monitor their movements.

<HEAD>Union Files Lawsuit Over Worsening Conditions For Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police say the growing number of drug-related arrests in the city has led to longer waits in booking and arraigning suspects, with some officers complaining of spending more than 30 hours processing offenders. `` I'm not going to say it's the worst it's ever been, but there is a backlog everywhere in the system,'' Inspector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, commander of the Police Department's <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, conceded Thursday. `` It's simply a volume problem.'' Although the officers are paid overtime for their waiting, the Patrolmen's <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, claiming that conditions are `` dangerous, unsanitary and overcrowded'' for officers forced to wait for hours in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Criminal Courts Building, <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booking </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Central Booking at the Men's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit was filed last month in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. A hearing is scheduled next week. `` Sure we like the overtime, but to be dehumanized like this, it's like blood money,'' said one officer who said he had been waiting 30 hours. `` The criminals we bring in get three meals a day and a place to sleep,'' said another. One detective who had arrested a pickpocket in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and spent 39 hours waiting for the arrest to be processed said, `` If I had it to do again I'd let the guy walk away.'' The officers all declined to give their names. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> blamed the problem on a significant increase in arrests in the past year, largely because of drug-related crimes. Citywide arrests increased 30.4 percent last month over January 1988, from 18,671 to 24,352. He said the additional arrests meant that the District Attorney's office in each borough had more cases and that officers had to wait longer for interviews with prosecutors in areas with limited space <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>, head of the police union, said conditions had become intolerable over the past year and the lawsuit was a last resort.

 A man shot and slightly wounded an ex-soldier and a bystander today on a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> street, police said. The former soldier, a Protestant who served part-time in the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> until three years ago, was hit in the arm, police said. A woman was hit with a stray bullet in the leg, they said. The incident happened on the main street of <LOCATION> Ballynahinch </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The gunman escaped in a car that had been hijacked outside a house in <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, a stronghold of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> support, police said. The occupants of the house were held hostage overnight and then freed. On Thursday, gunmen burst into a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> barroom in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and shot and wounded five customers, one of them critically, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> offshoot, claimed responsibility, saying it was avenging the killing of Catholics in recent days by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists. These victims included an attorney specializing in defending <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects, a town councilor representing the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, and a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> glazier with no known political connections. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are fighting to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite the province and its Protestant majority with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic. The Protestant assailants come from shadowy illegal groups committed to keeping Northern Ireland British. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, issued a statement denouncing the latest `` vicious cycle of violence and counter violence.'' It called Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> gunmen `` an evil scourge of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'' and appealed to the public to reject them and support the security forces. `` Experience has shown that violence only begets more violence and produces more grief and misery for all,'' it said.

<HEAD>Government Said Agents Got Test Bomb Through Security</HEAD>

 Federal agents carried a test bomb, hand grenade and gun through <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> security at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1987, the government charges in a lawsuit against the airline. The lawsuit alleging 25 violations of federal regulations was filed Thursday by <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, the acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at its corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the lawsuit. The lawsuit said that on June 22, 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> inpsector went through the airline's X-ray system at the airport `` with a test pipe bomb and a hand grenade in his carry-on luggage.'' Another agent had a gun in an attache case, the lawsuit said, and `` the screener, who was not paying attention to the screen while the encapsulated weapon passed through the X-ray system, failed to detect the weapon.'' Test weapons are made of materials similar to real weapons and should look the same on X-ray machines, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said. On the same day the agents made the tests, a federal agent saw 22 passengers go through <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> security `` without the employee looking through the monitor,'' the lawsuit said. It also said only one employee was working the security gate that day. Airlines are required to have both a monitor for X-ray machines and a supervisor on duty at all times. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, who is handling the case, said that under <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> procedures, airlines are notified of security violations shortly after they are detected, and `` some are filed -LRB- as civil complaints -RRB-, and some are not.'' The lawsuit seeks the maximum $ 1,000 fine for each of the 25 alleged security violations. Last December, a bomb planted on a Pan American jet exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. `` Passengers have a right to expect that the airlines to which they are paying large amounts of money are taking their security obligation seriously and are paying attention to what they are doing,'' <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has `` very elaborate, very rigorous'' security at every airport it serves, he said, but acknowledged, `` I know nothing about our system at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> in particular.'' Workers at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> desk at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> declined to comment. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said the airline has been fined for security lapses in the past and that most airlines have some documented security violations.

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has proposed talks with elected Palestinians on forming a `` political entity,'' and offered to hold elections in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking Thursday on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Arabic television, promised he would bring his proposal to a Cabinet vote if Palestinians in the territories accepted it, even with reservations. He said army troops might be withdrawn from the occupied lands on voting days. `` We recognize in you a possibility of a political entity,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told Palestinians. `` Let us be partners for peace.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> did not elaborate on what he meant by a `` political entity,'' but his wording seemed to suggest he was expanding on the idea of limited <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule or autonomy once offered by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the occupied territories Thursday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed a 25-year-old Palestinian, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulbul </PERSON>, during a stone-throwing clash in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. Eight Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulbul </PERSON> `` intended to throw a large brick at a soldier'' when he was shot. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents staged a one-day general strike today to protest his death, which brought to 381 the number of Palestinians killed in the 14-month rebellion against Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis have also been killed. In clashes today, two Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed one casualty. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislators, including one from the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, caused new tensions in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition government when they met with a prominent Palestinian activist. Aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc said the recent dialogue between some Israelis and Palestinians linked to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could reignite violence in the occupied lands and only strengthened the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> expressed support for the meetings of his party members with Palestinians and indicated he would join at a later stage despite the opposition of party hawks. `` I support meetings with the representatives of Palestinians from the territories who are not involved in terrorism,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` When I have time I'll meet them too.'' Two widely publicized meetings took place earlier this week in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> involving three prominent pro-PLO figures and leading Labor members. On Thursday, <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>, head of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Shinui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and Labor legislator <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON> met <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> who is closely identified with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But a growing uproar over the meeting prompted two reserve army generals, <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yariv </PERSON>, to back out. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, 48, who has been held in detention during most of the uprising, said he joined in the talks to explain the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s positions to the Israelis. `` It's time to go and talk to these people, and let them see the monster face to face, and see he is not a monster,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Tax Pros Get Wrong Answers, Too</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifty professional tax-return preparers came up with 50 different answers when asked to calculate the federal taxes of a hypothetical family, Money magazine reported today. The professionals' answers ranged from $ 12,359 to $ 35,813 _ an even worse performance than a year ago. The accountant who designed the test said the correct tax was $ 23,393, but the law is so confusing that several correct answers were possible, Money said. Ten of the 50 preparers made no major mistakes but computed the family's taxes as high as $ 24,493. `` The abundance of mistakes our test turned up suggests that pros are nowhere near as knowledgeable about the tax law as they are supposed to be,'' Money said in its March issue. `` After all, we were samplying highly regarded preparers who willingly accepted our challenge to calculate the model return.'' The survey suggests that it is not only <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees who are not fully up to speed on provisions of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> survey released last week found that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> personnel whose job is to answer taxpayers' telephoned queries gave the correct answers to only 64 percent of selected test questions that were posed during the last filing season. The hypothetical family in the magazine survey was one with problems that, while possible among those with high incomes, are unlikely to be encountered by the typical taxpayer. The family had salaries of $ 56,400 but both spouses took lump-sum withdrawals from their pensions after quitting their jobs last year. The wife started her own business and the husband spent the second half of the year negotiating to buy his own company. They had a variety of investments, owned two homes and were willed a third home by the wife's mother, who died during the year. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> asked 50 professional return preparers to figure the taxes of a make-believe family. Then, too, they came up with 50 different answers and their bottom-line figures varied by as much as 50 percent. `` What's their excuse this year?'' the magazine asked. <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, office of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> accountants, who designed this year's test, said he was completedly surprised by the results. `` When the tax-reform law was new, you could understand the confusion, but now it's hard to explain all the mistakes about fundamental rules,'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. The survey found that some of the professionals failed to ask the right questions when they encontered something confusing about the hypothetical family's finances. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that same shortcoming was to blame for many of the mistakes made by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> people who answer telephoned questions. Money's survey involved 30 certified public accountants, 12 preparers from franchise tax-preparation operations, three CPAs from national accounting firms and five enrolled agents, who are IRS-licensed tax-return preparers. Returns free of major mistakes were prepared by five CPAs not affiliated with national companies, one enrolled agent, three preparers from franchise outlets, and <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, the CPA who devised the test. Money noted that the survey was conducted before much of the computer software widely used in the business was ready for this year's returns. `` In all probability, the computers would have performed somewhat better than the preparers' pencils and calculators, although <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> maintains that software would not have caught the most common mistakes,'' the magazine said. Although the hypothetical family had financial situations that most Americans are not likely to encounter, the professional tax preparers made mistakes in areas that are far more common. For example, 16 of the 50 failed to note that the family's 13-year-old son would be required to file a return because he earned $ 600 mowing lawns.

<HEAD>Three Die In Forest Fire North Of French Riviera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of firefighters battled a blaze in a forest north of Nice today that has left three men dead and scorched more than 500 acres of trees, the French news agency reported. About 300 firemen fought to contain the fire that began Sunday in the forest that was a tinderbox as a result of the unusually dry weather, <ORGANIZATION> Agence-France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was not known exactly what sparked the fire near the village of <LOCATION> Saint-Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vesubie </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of Nice. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has been experiencing the driest winter in more than a quarter century and no rain has fallen in the area north of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> since Dec. 1. By mid-January an average of eight-tenths of an inch of rain had fallen nationwide instead of the usual 2.4 inches. `` The fire smolders under the trees and springs up in the least gust of wind,'' an unidentified fireman told AFP. On Thursday afternoon, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> worker died after rocks and branches fell on him while he was fighting the fire, <ORGANIZATION> AFP </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Djouari </PERSON>, a 50-year-old father of eight children, died from injuries to his head after being pushed by the debris into a 165-foot-deep ravine. Two men with Djouari were struck by falling rocks and were evacuated by helicopter, the news agency reported. Also on Thursday, an ambulance carrying an injured firefighter, <PERSON> Sebastien </PERSON> <PERSON> Antraygues </PERSON>, slid off the road and into a ravine, killing him. <PERSON> Angraygues </PERSON>, 21, had been working in the forest since Sunday. The driver of the ambulance was seriously injured in the accident. A number of other firefighters suffered minor injuries. On Tuesday, fireman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brutus </PERSON>, 50, was found dead from unknown causes in an area where he had been working.

<TEXT>
 Gravediggers ordered to exhume the corpse of a man who may have been murdered apparently dug up the wrong body twice and are n't sure where to dig next, a cemetery owner says. The <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> state's attorney's office ordered the exhumation of the Rev. <PERSON> Rayfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>, 77, who died last year two weeks after marrying a woman subsequently charged with killing four other people for their life insurance benefits. Detectives want an autopsy to see if he, too, was slain. The first body, removed in December from a pauper's grave at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Landsdowne </LOCATION> just south of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, was actually examined in an autopsy before someone noticed the identification tag on it. The body did n't even resemble <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>, said cemetery manager <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` The body was a real thin, skinny man,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON> was a heavy-set man with big, full face.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said his records wrongly indicated that <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>'s body was in row 83. After the mistake was discovered, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he realized <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON> actually should be in row 78. Several weeks later, another body was exhumed. But a detective at the grave found a toe tag with another man's name on it, so the body was reburied. `` The detective could n't make out the name on the tag. It was W-I-L something. So we put the body back,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he's not convinced the second body was n't <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>. `` The detective showed me a picture of Mr. <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>, and when we dug up the second coffin that guy looked exactly like Mr. <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Whoever embalmed him did a good job.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, who owns the cemetery, promised Thursday `` to do our best to find'' <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON>'s body. He blamed the erroneous burial records on inexperienced cemetery workers. Police say the woman <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON> married on Jan. 18, 1988, is <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>, 52, who is accused of orchestrating four slayings to collect the victims' insurance payments. <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON> died 15 days after the wedding, leaving his $ 440 a month in Social Security benefits, his home and about $ 1,000 to his wife. The death certificate said he died of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a type of heart disease. But the Rev. <PERSON> Alphonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who married the couple, said that <PERSON> Gilliard </PERSON> did n't have heart trouble as far as he knew Last summer, Ms. <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> was indicted and jailed, charged in four deaths and three attempts to kill a fifth person. Police seized 45 insurance policies from locked closets and safes at Ms. <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>'s home

 A Japanese balloonist will abandon his attempt to cross the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> alone because of unfavorable winds, and he plans to land his craft in the ocean, an official said today. Project spokesman <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> will bring his giant orange-and-blue balloon down Saturday after an airplane determines his exact location. Today the balloon was floating 4.4 miles above the ocean 1,450 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. A boat from the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> left <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> for the area today but was not likely to arrive until Sunday night, <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said, so <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> could end up bobbing in the sea in his tiny gondola for more than a day. When he took off early Wednesday, <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> hoped to travel 5,000 miles to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in about four days and become the first person to cross the ocean alone in a balloon. He planned to ride the jet stream _ high-speed, high-altitude winds that generally blow west to east _ but changed his mind when he discovered the jet stream would have pushed him north toward <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> initially stayed at a low altitude and traveled south in an attempt to catch the southernmost edge of the jet stream. He then jettisoned most of his ballast and rose in altitude, but missed the high-speed winds, said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, another project spokesman. `` The loss of the ballast means he no longer is able to maneuver up and down to find a good wind,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. The 38-year-old balloonist lifted off from <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, in the 6-foot-wide plastic gondola, which he designed himself. The capsule is pressurized and can float but has no navigational or heating equipment. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> relies on amateur radio reports based on satellite trackings to pinpoint his location. The temperature was 23 degrees inside the gondola this morning and minus 13 degrees outside, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. Battery-powered electric coils in <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>'s flying suit keep him warm. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to prepare for the flight. He said he planned to sleep during the day and stay awake at night. In 1981, four men crossed the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> by balloon for the first time, but no one has traveled the distance alone. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>, who has 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, estimated the flight would cost about $ 540,000, a sum he had hoped to regain by writing a book and lecturing about his experience.

 Authorities investigating a major stock scandal today raided the main offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and nine of its other facilities, and they arrested a former ministry official. <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kano </PERSON>, 55, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s employment service division, became the eighth suspect and the first former government official to be arrested in connection with the scandal. Since the scandal broke, 20 people, including three government ministers, have resigned their positions. <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION> resigned from his post in January after reports surfaced linking him to the stock scandal, in which selected politicians, bureaucrats and others were offered bargain-priced unlisted shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate subsidiary of the information-service conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Shareholders earned large profits after the stock was offered for over-the-counter trading, raising the issue of bribery and favor-granting on the part of those involved The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials charged <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION> played a major role in easing restrictions on employment information publishing, a move that would benefit <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which earns 60 percent of its income from publishing employment-related information. Recruit officials allegedly spent $ 10,000 wining and dining <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION> in return for his assistance in easing the restrictions, prosecutors claim. Following <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION>'s arrest, 15 investigators from the prosecutors office raided the main building of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, as well as nine other ministry-related facilities, to search for evidence against the former official, who resigned in January. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> described the raid on a public office as `` a very serious matter.'' He addressing legislators in a parliamentary committee but refused further comment on the latest development, saying he did n't yet have all the details. Public support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has been severely waning, a number of public opinion surveys have shown recently. A relative and an aide of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> were invited to purchase the Recruit-Cosmos shares, but the prime minister himself has denied knowledge of the transactions. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, another high-ranking involved in the scandal, said today that he regretted the arrest of a public official. `` From the standpoint of establishing strict descipline among public servants, it is regrettable that -LRB- the arrest -RRB- has in effect led to loss of public trust in the labor administration,'' <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said in a news conference. Also today, opposition parties stepped up demands in the Diet, or Japanese parliament, that former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> appear before a parliamentary committee for questioning on his own links to Recruit. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was one of 17 politicians who earned hefty profits in the transaction of unlisted shares. On Thursday, legislators raised questions regarding <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s role as then-prime minister in the purchase of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputers. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government telecommunications monopoly until its privatization in 1985, purchased two multi-million-dollar supercomputers from Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and resold them to Recruit in 1986. The supercomputers, operated by Recruit, have been kept on <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> premises until now and maintained by <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> technicians. Opposition lawmakers have charged Recruit is receiving favorable treatment and that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> played a role in arranging the purchase and maintenance setup. <PERSON> Naohiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Okubo </PERSON>, secretary general of the second-largest opposition party <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION>, called on <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> today to disclose the contents of the meeting between <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in May 1987 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, during which an agreement over the supercomputer purchase was reportedly reached. <PERSON> Okubo </PERSON> was addressing a nationally televised parliamentary committee session.

<HEAD>Woman With AIDS Virus Wins Fight Against Beauty Salons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state hearing examiner has ordered two beauty salons to serve a woman they turned away because she was infected with the AIDS virus. The consent order, coming two years after <PERSON> Tema </PERSON> <PERSON> Luft </PERSON>, 36, was turned away by the salons, preliminarily establishes the legal principle that people with AIDS-related illnesses are protected by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s anti-discrimination laws. `` This sends a message to businesses that are discriminating or might discriminate that if they do so, they are going to be charged with violating state law,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoshall </PERSON>, a lawyer for the state <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. Under the consent order approved Tuesday by a hearing examiner for the commission, the Nail Gallery in <LOCATION> Reisterstown </LOCATION> and All that Glitters in <LOCATION> Pikesville </LOCATION> agreed to serve Ms. <PERSON> Luft </PERSON> and others infected with the AIDS virus. The case marked the first time a hearing examiner ruled that a state law protecting handicapped people from discrimination applies to people infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The consent order averts a quasi-judicial hearing on the complaint. Ms. <PERSON> Luft </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employee who contracted the AIDS virus in 1985, said the settlement may not change attitudes toward the disease but will at least give infected individuals legal ammunition if they are faced with discrimination. She said she was unsure whether she would return to the salons for service. Both salons had served Ms. <PERSON> Luft </PERSON> until she made a televised appearance at an AIDS conference. `` My clients are naturally glad the case is over,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON>, attorney for the owners of All That Glitters. `` They hold no grudge about <PERSON> Tema </PERSON> and cetainly wish her well in dealing with her illness.'' A woman answering the phone at the Nail Gallery today said she was the owner but would not comment on the ruling or give her name.

 Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, abducted a year ago today while serving as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer, is alive despite his captors' statement that he was sentenced to death as a spy, a Shiite Moslem leader said. `` He'll be released eventually'' by the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists who seized him, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, political officer of the Amal militia in this ancient port 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, commanded a 76-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group monitoring the <LOCATION> Lebanon-Israel </LOCATION> border. He was kidnapped by gunmen who stopped his car on the highway south of Tyre 20 minutes after he had met with <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> would not say how he knew <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had not been killed by the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which claimed responsibility for the abduction. His militia claims to have undercover agents who track hostage developments. The moderate Shiite movement, backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, opposes the pro-Iranian fundamentalist Shiites who hold most of the 15 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be an umbrella group for those holding the hostages, were at war for months and nearly 600 people were killed. They reached a peace agreement in January that was mediated by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In an interview today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television's `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, said she held out hope that <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>'s comments about her husband being alive were true `` Of course we've seen many reports, some very much in conflict with that I hope it's true I hope we get better news and I hope we get him released soon,'' she said. Militia officials and other sources interviewed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> shed new light on <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction near Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988. His 44th birthday was Jan. 19. A security source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that members of Amal tried to rescue <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> three days after he was kidnapped, but were overwhelmed by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen in the village of <LOCATION> Jibcheet </LOCATION>. He said 15 Amal fighters `` infiltrated <PERSON> Jibcheet </PERSON> the night of Feb. 20 last year and surrounded the house where <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was being held. A dozen gunmen were guarding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> was determined to set him free. `` A few shots were fired, after which about 200 Hezbollahis surrounded the Amal men and disarmed them. A golden opportunity to release <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was lost.'' No independent confirmation of the report was available, but <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> did make a considerable effort to find <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Angered that he was kidnapped in territory it considered its turf, the militia created a dragnet and rounded up scores of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> activists. Reflecting on the meeting a year ago, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said: `` We talked about the hostages and several other things.'' Nine of the foreign captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are Americans, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, who has been held the longest. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' unit, since withdrawn, was attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Its 5,800 men from nine nations patrol a narrow strip of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> separating <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone'' from the rest of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> region. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the peacekeeping force, said: `` As a peacekeeper, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> did n't deserve such a treatment. We hope that one day the kidnappers will realize what a mistake they made and release him.'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, interviewed at the force's headquarters in the coastal village of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have `` no way of knowing'' whether the kidnappers carried out the threat to kill <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. They made it in a statement Dec. 12, the last received about the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government have denied allegations by the kidnappers that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a spy for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and was planning possible missions to rescue the other Americans. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harqous </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s security chief in Tyre, said `` the abduction was perfectly planned and carried out.'' He said the kidnappers `` drove <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in heavy rain through 10 villages and changed cars three times in the Tyre region before crossing the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on foot the night of Feb. 18.'' <PERSON> Harqous </PERSON> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> `` injured one of his legs during the rough hike'' northward and `` one of the kidnappers carried <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on his back across the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION>.'' He would not reveal his sources of information. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> then was taken to <PERSON> Jibcheet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harqous </PERSON> said, but he would not comment on the report of a rescue attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>. According to the security source, `` a few days after the confrontation'' his captors took <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> to a base on the slopes around <LOCATION> Louwaizeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, near the western flank of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security zone `` <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was held in <LOCATION> Louwaizeh </LOCATION> for about 40 days ... within a five-minute drive of the security zone,'' the source said. `` Early last April, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was moved in a car fitted with diplomatic license plates from <LOCATION> Louwaizeh </LOCATION> to south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and he's been held there ever since.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> controls nearly all the Shiite slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and most of the foreign captives are believed to be held there.

 A sniper fired more than 20 shots at a city attorney and a video crew re-enacting a controversial fatal police shooting of a retarded boy who had pointed a toy gun at officers, police said. Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiley </PERSON> and about a dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers were not injured in the incident Thursday, said police Officer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoshinsky </PERSON>. About eight shots were fired at the film crew from an abandoned unit at the <LOCATION> Potrero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> housing complex, <PERSON> Thoshinsky </PERSON> said. The sniper, using a semiautomatic weapon, then fired another 15 rounds. Police searched the area but did not find the gun or a suspect. The crew left after the shooting and did not complete the taping, which is to be used in a civil case against the Police Department by survivors of 13-year-old <PERSON> Silivelio </PERSON> `` Tony'' Grohse. The boy died last year after two officers mistook his toy pistol for a real weapon and shot him.

<TEXT>
 A controversial exhibition of avant-garde art reopened today under tight security, two days after police closed it because of a bomb threat. The show was also closed on opening day, Feb. 5, for five days when artists defied a ban on performance art and one fired two BBs into her sculpture. Uniformed guards patrolled the three floors of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery today as crowds of mainly young people gathered in front of the paintings and sculptures. Guards were posted at the main gate of the museum, and no bags or large packages were allowed inside. Police closed the show Wednesday after a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> newspaper received a letter saying bombs would be planted in the gallery if the show was not shut for good. Organizers said they believe an artist was responsible for the threat, which they view as a hoax. `` It seems to be another kind of performance art,'' said one organizer. `` We think the artist is trying to show art's relationship with Chinese society. On Feb. 5, a series of performance art pieces culminating in the shooting of a telephone booth sculpture by the artist led authorities to close the show. The artist and her boyfriend were detained for three days and then released. The show is the largest avant-garde show in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s history, filling five large halls of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery with more than 250 works. It is the first large-scale exhibition of Chinese modern art to be held in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since 1981.

<HEAD>Courthouse Toilets Explode When Compressor Connected to Water Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About two dozens toilets and urinals in the King County Courthouse exploded when they were flushed after an air compressor was mistakenly connected to a water line, officials said. `` We think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets,'' building services manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Thursday. `` The porcelain is actually cracked.'' Each time the pressurized privies were flushed in restrooms throughout the 72-year-old building, plumbing started popping, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. Instead of the usual swirl and gurgle of water, geysers erupted. Officials eventually traced the problem to an erroneous compressor hookup by a construction worker on a nearby $ 430 million bus tunnel project. `` They started blowing at about 11:30 -LRB- a.m. -RRB- and it took us a while to figure it out,'' he recounted. `` We knew it had to be air in the system, but the -LRB- city -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that was impossible.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said there were no reports of injuries, although several people apparently were soaked. After the incident, all courthouse restrooms were closed for the day, and employees and others had to walk across the street to toilets in the county Administration Building. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said most courthouse toilets would be back in operation today. Damage has yet to be determined.

<TEXT>
 The leaders of five North African nations today signed a treaty creating a common market and joining their countries in a union to compete with a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The chiefs of state of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> signed the document creating the `` Union of the Arab Great Maghreb'' in <LOCATION> Marrakech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> at the end of a three-day summit. `` Maghreb'' is the Arab word for `` west'' and is generally used to designate the Arab countries west of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s last minute proposal to expand the treaty to include <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> was quietly dropped. Instead, the leaders inserted a line in the text leaving the treaty open to include `` other Arab or African countries'' at a later date. The treaty would not have been possible without the recent reconciliation of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. The two countries had been on the brink of war for 15 years over <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s support for the Polisario guerrilla movement in the Moroccan-annexed <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> claims the former <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> territory. With <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> help, the quarrel was resolved. Immediately after the signing ceremony, the leaders went to the 1,000-year-old Koutoubia Mosque to pray. The main body of the union is a council made up of the five chiefs of state. It will meet at least once a year to make decisions and set policy on a variety of economic issues. All decisions must be reached unanimously with any single nation having the right to veto. A commission of prime ministers and foreign ministers will handle day-to-day affairs. The goal is for individuals and goods to be able someday to move freely through the 2-million-square-mile North African region. In addition, trade agreements with foreign states or groups of states will be negotiated jointly. The leaders also plan to institute a single identity card for all citizens of the new union. The Arab leaders found motivation for their treaty in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without borders. Under a plan by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, the arrangement would be in place after 1992 and would permit the free flow of goods and people throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 A serial killer is preying on prostitutes in the same crime-infested area that gave rise to the <LOCATION> Southside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slayer </LOCATION>, and may have killed as many as 12 women, authorities said. `` I will confirm that an investigation is currently being conducted on female victims who were engaged in prostitution for drugs,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, a department spokesman. Police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON>, who is coordinating the latest investigation, said Thursday that at least nine of the most recent victims were killed with the same weapon. `` There's one gun. They have one weapon used over and over,'' <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON> said. `` It's a small handgun. This type and caliber of handgun has been targeted by the department.'' `` You do n't know there's one killer until several deaths occur,'' <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON> said. `` Once they make the connection and see the same gun, they realize they have the same suspect.'' Television station <ORGANIZATION> KABC </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that as many as 12 prostitutes have been found shot to death in the area since August 1985. <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON> also headed the task force that investigated the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Southside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, whose victims were found strangled in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> between September 1983 and July 1986. Most of them had been stabbed, and all but a few had arrest records for prostitution. One man has been convicted of one of the slayings and two others were charged separately in seven of the killings. <ORGANIZATION> KABC </ORGANIZATION> said police have been quietly investigating the latest string of killings for a year, which drew criticism from community activist <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescod </PERSON>, who called such a low-profile approach outrageous. `` It feels as though history is repeating itself,'' she said. `` Eleven women were already murdered before they called the press conference to tell us about the Southside Slayer.'' <ORGANIZATION> KABC </ORGANIZATION> said the investigation had been kept quiet because of fears that publicity would bring protests from residents, but <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> denied that was the case. `` Our reluctance to publicize the killings has nothing to do with a fear of any major demonstrations,'' he said. Police added they are warning women who fit the profile of those murdered to be cautious. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said the victims are called `` strawberries'' in street jargon because they sell sex for drugs, but declined to give further background on them.

 <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, who abandoned dreams of a medical career to become one of the world's most popular fashion designers, died today following a long battle with intestinal cancer, a company spokesman said. He was 65. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> died at his home in a fashionable <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood at about 1 a.m. surrounded by his family and friends, said <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Caboche </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> SA. During the last showing of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> haute couture, <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> won the prestigious Golden Thimble award for the season's most beautiful clothes. It was the second time he had won the prize. The designer was greeted with enthusiastic applause when he appeared on stage with his models Jan. 25. He looked gaunt, and many fashion insiders speculated the show would be his last. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> once said `` eccentricity is not the synonym for elegance,'' and during his long career his strength was in knowing how to seize a fashion mood and translate it into clothes that would attract attention without shocking. His style was young and elegant, known for luscious fabrics and vibrant colors. The designer's clientele included film star <PERSON> Mireille </PERSON> <PERSON> Darc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> and former Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouclier </PERSON>, executive president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chambre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Couture </ORGANIZATION>, the professional association of the couture industry, called <PERSON> Larouche </PERSON> `` courageous'' for working nearly up to the time of his death. `` He was truly a friend and a great man _ simple, unaffected. He never acted like a star,'' <PERSON> Mouclier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, born July 16, 1921, was the son of a hotel owner in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>. He planned a career in medicine but became fascinated by clothes at the age of 19, when a friend took him to see a fashion show. `` Dazzled by the clothes, I then began to sketch myself,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> showed some of his sketches to the couturier <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Desses </PERSON> and became his assistant in 1949. He spent a few months in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> studying manufacturing methods, becoming inspired by Dior, <PERSON> Balenciaga </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fath </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Balmain </LOCATION>. In 1957, <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> opened his own couture house and two years later, <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s awarded him its prize for outstanding creation. In 1961, <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> launched a ready-to-wear line, which soon earned renown among discriminating women as the most reasonably priced outfits sold by any big name French house. He introduced a line of menswear in 1967. In the 1970s, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douvier </PERSON> took over designing ready-to-wear under <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>'s supervision, and the number of <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>'s boutiques swelled to 250 worldwide, including shops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He also created perfumes. In July 1985, the modest couturier was awarded the Golden Thimble prize for excellence for his autumn-winter couture collection. By 1987, the <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> operation boasted a global turnover of about $ 270 million. In April 1987, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> awarded <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> the <PERSON> Chevalier </PERSON> of the Legion of Honor, citing his contributions to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, including `` maintaining a certain image of our country with which we closely identify _ that of taste and elegance.'' Funeral arrangements were not announced.

Of particular concern is Tower's 16-month stint in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> as head of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation that met with the Soviets to discuss mutual cuts in long-range nuclear missiles. The former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was there from January 1985 to April 1986. According to a report in today's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, details on Tower's sexual activities in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> would come out in a closed hearing of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating allegations of security violations by another member of the delegation. The newspaper reported that an investigator from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> were to arrive Saturday from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The investigators are to appear at a session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee headed by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D.-Mich. The Times report, which deals with a hearing on allegations against retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moser </PERSON>, says allegations about Tower arose in an <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> review on <PERSON> Moser </PERSON>'s request for a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> security clearance. The review said Tower kept both his secretaries in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> as mistresses, the newspaper reported. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel claimed there were 14 separate liaisons involving members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. In another published report, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said today that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report summarizing the bureau's findings has uncovered no evidence linking him to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal or illegal campaign contributions. But the newspaper quoted one source as saying the report would contain `` a wealth of allegations about the guy's personal conduct.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who wrote the report, told the newspaper the report will contain new information on Tower that has not been made public. Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and philandering. Many senators also have voiced concern whether Tower could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than $ 1 million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is reviewing the nomination, has said that an investigation of Tower's actions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> found no security breaches Additionally, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, that if members of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bring up questions about Tower's personal life the lawmakers may be forced to meet behind closed doors. `` I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor by senators who are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deliberations should the nomination clear his panel. `` I emphasize that the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will make this decision, not the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or its chairman,'' he said. A closed session of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is highly unusual, occurring on average about once a year and usually relating to national security issues. The last closed session occurred on March 29, 1988, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met to discuss the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Tower's conduct in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> also drew criticism this week from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's former arms control chief, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>. Although impressed with Tower's performance as a strategic arms negotiator, <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's `` lack of discretion proved troublesome then, as before and since.'' Tower's private behavior did n't directly affect his conduct of official business at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said Tower's conduct should be a factor in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation deliberations because `` a <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary has no private life.'' <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview published Thursday and in a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> column on Wednesday, provided no details on what activities proved `` troublesome.''

 A four-alarm fire broke out early today in a downtown hotel, killing at least four people and forcing some residents to slide down makeshift ropes of blankets and sheets in freezing weather, officials said. Fire officials said arson was suspected. At least 52 people were sent to hospitals. Four police officers trying to evacuate the residential hotel were among the injured. The fire was discovered at 3:12 a.m. at the Billinghurst Hotel by police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, who was on routine patrol, police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. Buck said <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> got one resident out of the building, called the fire department, then went back in to alert other residents. Temperatures were in the teens while some residents tied sheets and blankets together to slide from their windows down the five-story building's walls. <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, 25, said he was awakened in his second-story room by the smell of smoke. `` Then I opened the door and I could n't breathe,'' he said. `` I went to the window, tied sheets -LRB- together -RRB-, grabbed my credentials and climbed out.'' `` There were quite a few jumpers, as you can see these sheets hanging out of windows,'' said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Finazzo </PERSON>. Authorities suspect an arsonist started the blaze on the hotel's first floor, <PERSON> Finazzo </PERSON> said, but he refused to elaborate Residents and fire officials estimated 130 to 200 people, most welfare recipients, lived in the brick hotel. The building had no sprinkler system, but some residents said they heard smoke alarms sounding. Buck said the identities and cause of death of the four dead people were unconfirmed. The injured were taken to four hospitals. Buck said at least three of the hurt, some of whom were injured while jumping out of windows, were in critical condition. The injured officers suffered from smoke inhalation, broken bones and other injuries. Their conditions were unknown.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has sent messages to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other world leaders asking for help in ending the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official announced today. The Soviets pulled the last of more than 100,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday. However, U.S.-backed insurgents there have pledged to keep fighting until they overthrow the pro-Moscow government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>, the Soviet first deputy foreign minister, said today that his country appealed on Thursday to many nations and world organizations to take a part in stabilizing the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He told a government news briefing the appeals called for economic and humanitarian assistance. <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> declined to disclose the contents of the letter <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The leaders of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also received messages from the Soviets, the minister said.

In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue helping guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> despite the Soviet army's withdrawal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he was concerned that departing Soviet forces may have stockpiled weapons for the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another. They stayed on to fight the anti-government insurgency. The Soviets pulled out under a U.N.-brokered agreement reached last April in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said today the nation's war could end in a negotiated settlement within weeks and that representatives of his Marxist government have talked with Moslem guerrillas The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent messages to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other world leaders asking for help in ending the war. The main highway connecting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which Soviet troops used to withdraw, remained open, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said more than 100 trucks carrying Soviet food and supplies were bound for the Afghan capital. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also said he had sent emissaries to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to talk with former Afghan King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> and that his government had been in contact with the Moslem guerrilla resistance. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, Soviet deputy foreign minister, gave a similar report at a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, where he met with government officials in talks aimed at ending the war between the Afghan government and the guerrillas. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said some guerrilla groups were in contact with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, despite their public vows against any negotiations with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. `` Some dealing exists already _ clandestinely,'' he said without elaborating. When <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was asked by Western reporters whether there could be peace in days or months, he replied: `` Maybe weeks.'' But he has repeatedly insisted that any political settlement must include the governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Some Western officials believe the Moslem guerrillas will soon capture key <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> cities now that the Soviet troops are gone. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>, the Soviet First Deputy foreign minister, told reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today that his country appealed on Thursday to many nations and world organizations to take a part in stabilizing the Afghan situation. He said the appeals called for economic and humanitarian assistance, but he declined to describe the contents of the message <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We believe that all countries should respond to the emerging opportunity to put an end to the drawn-out conflict by promoting the complete and fast settlement of the situation,'' the Soviet official said.

<HEAD>Report: Urban Rebels Plan To Kill Five People A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist guerrillas operating in the nation's cities say they plan to kill five people a month in their fight against the government, according to a report published today. Also today, the military reported that 21 people were killed Thursday in clashes between government troops and communist rebels. The tabloid <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonight </ORGANIZATION> today reproduced a crudely scribbled note the newspaper said it received Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> Alex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boncayao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION>, the urban assassination unit of the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` Five officials a month is our quota,'' said the note, which was signed `` ABB-Jomar Squad.'' An accompanying article said that shortly before the note was delivered, a man claiming to be a rebel spokesman telephoned the newspaper's office with the same message. On Wednesday, four men gunned down a constabulary intelligence officer in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Malabon </LOCATION> and left a note signed `` A.B.B.-Jomar Squad.'' A military officer and an enlisted man were shot to death Monday on <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s outskirts by suspected rebels. One of the assailants also was killed in the gunfire. The <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Boncayao </PERSON> Brigade claimed responsibility. In one of the military attacks Thursday, 10 soldiers and a civilian cook were killed when 200 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rebels fired on two army trucks packed with troops in <LOCATION> Misamis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Occidental </LOCATION> province, the military said. The soldiers were disembarking from their trucks in <LOCATION> Calamba </LOCATION> municipality, 450 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, when the rebels opened fire, the report said. It said scores of people were injured and that the bodies of eight guerrillas were found after a firefight of several hours. Also Thursday, rebels sprayed a constabulary patrol car with bullets in the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pampanga </LOCATION> province, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and killed one soldier, another military report said. A rebel also was killed in the attack, the report said.

 Flood waters began to recede in parts of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> but the mighty <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and other rivers rose today after a week of unrelenting rain flooded homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents. A central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town became an island when swirling, muddy water encapsuled it Thursday. The only way out was by boat or helicopter. Three people were killed and a child was missing after their car was swept away in a rain-swollen creek near <LOCATION> Mineral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to designate eight middle <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> counties as flood disaster areas. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> officials said they would seek similar federal relief. `` We hope the worst of it is over,'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said after touring some of the hardest-hit areas of his state. Although the rain let up Thursday, <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, an operations officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said today that forecasters were watching a storm in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> expected to move into the state. `` It appears to be headed toward us. ... Either <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> will get a lot of moisture. We just do n't know who it's going to be,'' he said A week's worth of rainfall, measuring more than 10 inches in some places, flooded roads, forced schools to close and claimed at least three lives. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> officials estimated that at least 1,000 people were forced from their homes by rising waters in most of the river systems in the western two-thirds of the state. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> crested today at 44.2 feet _ more than 13 feet above flood stage _ at <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and several other rivers and streams also began receding, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. However, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> rivers were still rising slightly and could force some river levels higher again, said forecaster <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, officials said Valentine's Day flooding in <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> damaged 66 businesses and 28 homes around the city of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, causing an estimated $ 1.9 million in damage. The rain-swollen <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> burst through a levee in rural <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> early Thursday, sending a three-foot wall of water through the towns of <PERSON> Rives </PERSON> and Obion, forcing 377 people from their homes, officials said. At least 43 homes, seven mobile homes, two churches and a fire station were saturated with water after the levee burst, said <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>. `` A lot of the homes had up to 50 percent damage,'' he said. `` It could be quite a while before they get back into them.'' <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said the river had begun receding and damage assessment would begin today. Flood waters turned the riverside community of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, population 400, into an island. The Rolling Fork of the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> neared a crest of 52 feet today, three-tenths of a foot over its previous record high. Conditions in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> wo n't improve significantly until the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> crests at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, 23 miles north, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said today. `` We're locked in,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 35. `` It's the nearest thing to suffocating.'' All roads were blocked and residents could n't even walk out. On Thursday, people strolled in the sunshine _ the first break from rain in four days _ and picked up supplies at the town's only open store, all the while warily eying the waters that were still rising. `` We've got plenty of food. As long as nobody gets sick, we're all right,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandiver </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for 32 years Disaster officials in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> said they hoped to have enough information compiled today to make a preliminary request for federal aid. Assistance could include low-interest loans and special attention from federal relief programs. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Division of Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said firm figures on the actual damage caused by the flooding will not be available until the waters recede.

 Five hand grenades were tossed at a group of black police officers, killing one and injuring nine, officials said today. Police said the attack occurred Thursday night in <LOCATION> Kathlehong </LOCATION>, a black township east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>, 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, blacks were considering a boycott of white businesses in response to beatings of blacks who venture out after dark, according to a report published today. In the bombing incident, 10 special constables _ blacks assigned to police duty in townships after shorter-than-normal training periods _ were standing in a railway yard when one or more assailants hurled five hand grenades, police said. Constable W.S. <PERSON> Tladi </PERSON> was killed and nine officers were injured, two seriously, police said. A similar attack occurred in <LOCATION> Kathlehong </LOCATION> Jan. 5, when one black police officer was killed and 31 injured by a grenade thrown while they were on parade. There was no claim of responsibility for either attack. Police have blamed the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement for virtually all of the numerous attacks on black officers, who are viewed by many black activists as collaborators with the white government. The country's largest-circulation black newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, reported that blacks in the mining town of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> planned a consumer boycott to protest beatings by whites of blacks seen on local streets after dark. The town council is controlled by the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and has proposed a curfew that would bar blacks from the town center at night. A decision on the proposal is expected by the end of the month. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said black activists would meet Sunday to discuss a boycott.

<HEAD>Two Anti-Apartheid Publications Banned for Three Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today banned two anti-apartheid publications for three months after accusing them of repeatedly publishing subversive material. The publications, based in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and affiliated with each other, are Grassroots, a monthly tabloid newspaper, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Era </ORGANIZATION>, a quarterly magazine. Three other anti-apartheid publications were banned for varying periods last year under state-of-emergency regulations which give broad censorship powers to Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. He said Grassroots and New Era had carried articles `` promoting revolution, stirring up hatred towards the security forces, and promoting the public esteem of unlawful organizations, such as the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the leading group fighting the South African system of apartheid, which enshrines control by 5 million whites over a country with 26 million blacks. Grassroots was established in 1980 and distributes 50,000 copies throughout the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> region. New Era, a younger publication, circulates 5,000 copies nationwide. In a statement responding to the banning, the staff of Grassroots said: `` Today is a tragic one for the people of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>.'' `` Our fate has been predetermined by an individual minister whose subjective opinion can not be challenged in a court of law,'' it said. `` On May 17, we will back, and we will be continuing to publish the truth.''

<HEAD>Racial Slurs Sent Via Police Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police officers in at least four departments have used the mobile computer terminals in their patrol cars to transmit racial and other slurs, authorities said. Police Chief <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonebraker </PERSON> said three officers in his department were disciplined for two incidents that have occurred since 1986, and a third incident last weekend was still under investigation. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, executive director of the police communications center that recorded the exchanges, said Thursday that officers at the three other police departments the center serves _ <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gardena </PERSON> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION> _ have transmitted similar messages over their computers in the last several years. The first incident reported in <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION> came to light earlier this week when computer printouts kept at the communications center were leaked to television station <ORGANIZATION> KCBS </ORGANIZATION>. They showed officers transmitting racial, anti-homosexual and anti-Semitic jokes. `` They're inappropriate. There's no way to justify them,'' <PERSON> Stonebraker </PERSON> said. But he added he does n't believe the three incidents represent a festering problem within the department. Officers are told during training that computer printouts are routinely kept of their computer exchanges, <PERSON> Stonebraker </PERSON> said. None of the officers has been identified. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, western regional manager of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, called the incident `` extremely troubling.'' `` The messages tell us blacks are not welcome in that community,'' he said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is on a stress-disability leave from the <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> department that he says was brought on by racial discrimination, declined to comment on the messages. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is black, recently set up a videotaped sting operation against <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police he said was designed to see if charges of racism within that department were true. The videotape, broadcast nationally, shows a white officer apparently slamming <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s head through a plate glass window during a traffic stop.

 More than 100 detainees in a Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> prison ended a 3-week-old hunger strike today after being told of a government promise to free some blacks being held without charge. The decision by 105 detainees at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> was announced by attorney <PERSON> Kobus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>. It followed a decision Thursday by 170 detainees at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> prision to end their hunger strike. An undetermined number of other detainees continued their strike at other prisons around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Prominent anti-apartheid detainees, including some who have been hospitalized from the effects of the strike, were freed while attorneys met with the minister of law and order aimed at more releases. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area, was freed from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, his lawyer's office said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> had not been part of the hunger strike that began at Diepkloof prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on Jan. 23 and spread to other prisons and jails in the country. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> had been detained since October. He previously had been detained from August 1986 through July 1988. When <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> was freed in July, he was ordered not to talk to journalists, criticize the government, or participate in any activities of the now-banned <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION>, which was the nation's largest anti-apartheid group. It was not immediately known if any restrictions were placed on <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> in connection with his release today. The minister of law and order, <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, said Thursday a `` substantial number'' of the estimated 1,000 blacks in custody without charge would be released within two weeks, but he said some would be placed under restrictions.

<HEAD>Researchers Did Not Uncover Arctic Ozone Hole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers said today the atmosphere over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region `` is primed for a very large destruction of ozone'' but a six-week study did not uncover a vast ozone `` hole'' as had been found over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>. Scientists who led the recently concluded international research effort into Arctic ozone depletion said there are clear chemical signs that significant ozone destruction could occur over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region, possibly within the next few weeks. However, `` there is no large ozone hole in the Arctic,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientists and one of the research project leaders, told a news conference. A Canadian scientist recently suggested in a study that an ozone hole may be developing over the Arctic because of atmospheric pollution. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said the latest research could not make that conclusion. But he and Dr. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, another project scientist, said the research effort found `` strong evidence'' of an abundance of chemically active chlorine compounds and other conditions in the Arctic region that are key to the destruction of the ozone layer. An international team of scientists began the research effort in early January and concluded it recently. Scientists are concerned about the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere because it provides a protective layer against ultraviolet rays of the sun. Overexposure to such rays has been linked to skin cancer. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said it has been estimated that a 1 percent depletion of ozone causes a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet radiation. A primary cause of ozone depletion is the release of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, into the stratosphere. An international treaty has called for the reduction of CFCs _ used as a refrigerant and as a foam-blowing agent _ by 50 percent over the next decade because of its harm to the ozone layer. The Arctic research effort, which involved scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, began Jan. 1 from a base in <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. It included 28 flights over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region aboard an instrument-laden DC-8 and a high-altitude ER-2 surveillance aircraft to gather data. The researchers focused on a large `` vortex'' of westerly winds over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region. They reported finding the stratosphere 12 or more miles above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> `` highly perturbed'' because of chemical reactions, including the presence of high levels of man-made, ozone-depleting chlorine oxide gasses. Furthermore, said the scientists, they confirmed an abundance of high-level clouds formed by tiny particles of ice. These so-called `` polar stratospheric clouds'' intensify the chemical reaction that destroys ozone because they provide a surface chlorine molecules. The researchers said the six-week study found no direct evidence of <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> ozone loss, but they concluded that `` a considerable portion of the vortex air was primed for zone destruction'' and if the amount of sunlight increases ozone could be destroyed `` at a significant rate'' possibly as much as 1 percent a day while the conditions exist. But they said the research provided no solid evidence as to how much ozone destruction might occur over the Arctic. Scientists previously have estimated that based on data collected from baloons about 6 percent of the Arctic ozone may have been destroyed since l970. The scientists said the degree of actual Arctic ozone destruction in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including future weather conditions, amount of sunlight and how long the wind patterns remain in place. Nevertheless, said Tuck, `` the atmosphere -LRB- over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> -RRB- is primed for a very large destruction of ozone'' although scientists do not foresee the degree of ozone destruction over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> as has been found over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. `` We're not dealing with a 50 percent -LRB- ozone -RRB- loss situation here,'' said <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, a scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal judge today ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> can reinstate a policy that confines refugees to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while their applications for political asylum are considered. The decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> denied an injunction sought by attorneys for refugees who sued the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> over the no-travel policy. The regulation was blamed for a backup of hundreds of homeless Central Americans at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The judge on Jan. 9 temporarily ordered the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to allow refugees to travel to their intended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations while he reviewed the request for a permanent lifting of the no-travel policy. Many refugees then boarded buses for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. A report Thursday indicated Central American refugees might be detained in a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tent city while their applications for political asylum are processed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, says the facility would meet basic human necessities of adequate housing, food and sanitary conditions. There would not be a fence. `` We think that's going to create a multitude of problems here in the -LRB- Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> -RRB- </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, one of the attorneys who sued the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> over the matter, said after learning of the judge's decision. The attorneys quickly appealed <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>'s order. Attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanez </PERSON> said she filed the appeal in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and asked for an injunction against the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> pending that appeal. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> said they would comment on the ruling later today. More than 100,000 Central Americans are expected to pour into the area this year, after crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> illegally near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials last spring reported a large increase in the number of Central Americans seeking political asylum in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The agency had stamped asylum-seekers documents and allowed them to travel to their declared <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations until Dec. 15, when faced with huge case backlogs in cities such as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, it started requiring people to pursue their cases in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. Hundreds of immigrants started camping in squalid conditions in makeshift tents and condemned buildings in the area, prompting a local public outcry. Attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, contending it failed to seek public comment before making the change, as required by federal law. The suit prompted Judge <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> to issue the temporary restraining order that expires Monday. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> today agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> that public comment was not required for the travel restriction because it merely constituted `` general statements of agency organization, procedure, or practice,'' and did not remove the opportunity to apply for asylum. The changes were `` procedural, rather than substantive,'' <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said. `` The changes merely alter the location of adjudication of the asylum applications,'' he wrote. Asylum is granted to those fleeing various forms of persecution. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> contends, however, that most of those seeking asylum come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only for economic reasons, and therefore do not qualify for asylum. Those suing the agency contend that the asylum-seekers should be able to travel to cities where they have families and friends and better access to legal representation while pursuing their cases.

 A Colombian who ran a major money-laundering operation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for some of the world's biggest cocaine traffickers has been sentenced to 40 years in prison. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, who claims he was engaged in the legitimate business of currency exchange, said after sentencing Thursday he would appeal his conviction. <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> and three other men sentenced with him in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court were arrested in June 1987 after a three-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover investigation. About 100 people around the country turned over $ 200 million in drug money to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as money launderers, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> was convicted in November of 66 counts, including multiple violations of the federal Money Laundering and Travel acts, racketeering and conspiracy. He was found to have moved about $ 13 million in cocaine proceeds through a dummy corporation set up by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> between September 1986 and June 1987. Prosecutors also presented evidence that he laundered about $ 7 million through operations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Assistant U.S. Attorneys <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON> told the court that the money laundered by <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> would purchase more than 2 -LCB- tons of cocaine in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Also Thursday Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> was a lieutenant in an enterprise that laundered money for the organization of <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, the government said. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lora </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 35, Colombians who had been living in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, received 16-year prison sentences. Prosecutors said they served as brokers in the money-laundering business. Three men described as couriers for <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> were sentenced Wednesday. One received a four-year sentence while the others were placed on probation. <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> was the only defendant convicted in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> who did not plead guilty.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> evacuated some of its personnel from the embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, this morning, using a routine helicopter supply flight to move the workers to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, defense officials said.

 The commander of the Christian-controlled army said today the nation faces an `` apocalypse'' if fighting flares up again between his forces and a rival Christian militia. Army leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government, told a news conference: `` We are responsible for the state, and they want a mini-state ... Those who do not abide by the law, I'll crush their heads.'' A cease-fire between the army and the Lebanese Forces militia was reached Wednesday after fierce clashes earlier in the week around Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> left 69 people dead and 197 wounded, according to police count. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was being caught in the crossfire, and today some personnel were evacuated. Defense officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who requested anonymity, said between 13 and 16 diplomatic workers were withdrawn on Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, leaving about 25 others still at work at the embassy. The helicopters are based on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to provide logistical support to the embassy because of the uncertainty of access to the war-torn nation. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said today he accepted the cease-fire mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> and hopes efforts to reach a peaceful settlement will succeed. `` Otherwise, it will be total destruction,'' he said. `` This time it will be apocalypse,'' he said at his heavily-guarded headquarters in the <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> suburb, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> demanded the rival Christian force withdraw from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and accused it of starting this week's fighting. The battles have deepened divisions in the Christian community in this nation already rent by years of civil war between Christians and Moslems, who control a rival government. The army commander said his forces thwarted an attack by the Lebanese Forces on his home in a wealthy section of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He was away in <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> at the time. During the battles this week, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army captured militia positions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountains. It also broke through some militia strongholds in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but the militia remained in most residential districts here.

<HEAD>50 Experts Calculate Mythical Family's Taxes, Give 50 Different Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you're still confused about the new federal tax law, you're in good company. Fifty professionals who advertise themselves as experts calculated a mythical family's taxes and came up with 50 different answers. Even worse, according to a survey by Money magazine, the experts' figure for the family's tax bill varied from $ 12,539 to $ 35,813 The correct answer, according to the accountant who devised the test, was $ 23,393. `` The abundance of mistakes our test turned up suggests that pros are nowhere near as knowledgeable about the tax law as they are supposed to be,'' Money writes in its March issue. `` After all, we were sampling highly regarded preparers who willingly accepted our challenge to calculate the model return.'' The experts actually did worse than in a similar Money test a year ago, when taxpayers were facing effects of the landmark 1986 tax law for the first time. In last year's survey, the professionals also came up with 50 different answers but the gap between the highest and lowest was about 50 percent; this year, the highest was almost 300 percent of the lowest. `` I was completely surprised by the results,'' said <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, office of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> accountants, who made up this year's test. `` When the tax-reform law was new, you could understand the confusion, but now it's hard to explain all the mistakes about fundamental rules,'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. The hypothetical family's tax return was tackled by 30 independent certified public accountants, 12 representatives of franchise return-preparation outlets, three CPAs from national accounting companies and five enrolled agents, who are tested and licensed by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Their fees range from $ 325 to $ 2,500. According to Money, the only preparers who made no major goofs were five independent CPAs, one enrolled agent, four franchised preparers and <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, who devised the test. For the test, <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> conjured up a three-member family whose tax problems are unlikely to be faced by most taxpayers. However, <PERSON> Money </PERSON> said, the experts made mistakes on basic tax provisions that could affect taxpayers at almost any income level. For example, the family's 13-year-old son earned $ 600 mowing lawns but 16 of the professionals failed to note that he would have to file a return. Twelve of the experts made the wrong choice on the tax treatment of inherited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds, raising the family's taxes by $ 3,300 The family had salaries of $ 56,400 but both spouses quit their jobs during the year and took big lump-sum withdrawals from their pensions. The wife set up her own business; the husband was negotiating to buy his own company. The couple had several investments, owned two homes and inherited a third from the wife's mother The biggest problem for the experts _ although it had a relatively minor impact on the family's taxes _ was calculating the deduction for interest. The 1986 law made major changes on this deduction. Ten preparers were wrong in claiming the husband's mother, who lived with the family all year, as a dependent. Nineteen experts claimed three times too much depreciation on equipment used in the wife's new business. However, Money reported, some errors can not be blamed on the new law. The magazine said 14 professional preparers made the wrong calculation on a loss on the sale of stock _ an area of law that dates back to 1921. Money noted that the survey was conducted before much of the computer software widely used in the business was ready for this year's returns. With computers, the results would have been better, the magazine said, although <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said computers would not have prevented the most common goofs. It is not just professional return preparers who are having trouble with the new law. Two weeks ago a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> personnel whose job is to answer telephoned queries from taxpayers gave the right response to test questions only 64 percent of the time during the last filing season.

 A fast-moving five-alarm fire gutted a prominent art gallery, destroying a collection valued by the artist at more than $ 1 million and sending off flames that were visible throughout most of the city. No injuries were reported, but about 1,100 people attending a concert at the <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>, adjacent to the <LOCATION> Duquette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>, were evacuated, authorities said. `` The interior is all gone,'' Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said at the scene of the blaze. The blaze was controlled at 2:44 a.m., more than five hours after it was reported. Firefighters were still trying to determine its cause but Fire Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said it was believed to have started in a caretaker's apartment in the six - to seven-story building, formerly a synagogue Arson investigator <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> said there was nothing suspicious about the fire. `` There were flames like I've never seen before,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, 18, who lives a few blocks from the gallery, which features the work of artist and owner <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Duquette </PERSON>. The fire was visible from most of the city and acrid smoke blanketed the Western Addition district and surrounding neighborhoods. Buildings adjacent to the gallery, including the famous Fillmore and the former Peoples Temple run by the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, were not damaged by flames but may have suffered water damage, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. About 140 firefighters battled the fire, which quickly climbed to the roof of the stately buff brick building. <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said the structure's large open interior space and wooden ceiling supported by trusses instead of columns made it difficult to fight the blaze. A shaken <PERSON> Duquette </PERSON> watched as firefighters directed cascades of water into the building through the shattered stained glass window and the remains of a metal starburst sculpture that partly covered it. The artist said the collection was valued at more than more $ 1 million but was too distraught to provide other details. The collection, which had been featured in Time and other publications, included tapestries and sculptures, much of it dedicated to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>, the saint for whom <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is named.

 About two dozen toilets and urinals in the King County Courthouse exploded when they were flushed because an air compressor had been erroneously connected to a water line, officials said. `` We think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets,'' said building services manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` The porcelain is actually cracked.'' `` We knew it had to be air in the system, but the -LRB- city -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that was impossible,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. Officials eventually traced Thursday's problem in the 72-year-old building to an compressor hooked up by a construction worker at a nearby $ 430 million bus tunnel project. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said no injuries were reported, although several people apparently were soaked. All courthouse restrooms were closed for the rest of the day, and people had to cross the street to toilets in the county Administration Building. Damages had not yet been determined.

<TEXT>
 With less than a week to go before the state funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, riot police already have taken up positions along the procession route from the Imperial Palace to the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Gardens. Other preparations for the Feb. 24 funeral are entering the final stages. Bulldozers, cranes and construction workers have clearly left their mark on the normally serene, parklike grounds of the gardens, where the funeral will be held. A main funeral hall with a curved roof in the traditional style of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s indigenous religion has been built, along with a reception area for mourners and a prefabricated shelter for the media. Dominating the gardens are two white tents more than 330 feet long where the imperial family, government leaders, foreign dignitaries and other guests will be seated. Foreign Ministry officials, who gave foreign reporters their first look at the site Friday, said 5,000 people will be seated in each tent. Guests unable to see the main hall will be able to view the proceedings on seven high-definition TV screens. Representatives of 154 nations are expected to attend. Among the dignitaries will be President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Foreign Ministry officials have been overwhelmed by more than 1,000 foreign journalists seeking credentials. Security at the gardens is tight, with armored police vehicles and road blocks securing entrances. Officers scan the surrounding area from perches atop a large greenhouse. Since <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death from cancer on Jan. 7, his body has lain in state at the main ceremonial hall of the palace. Riot police, sometimes stationed only hundreds of yards apart, have begun a 24-hour watch on the four-mile route along which the emperor's body will travel from the palace to the gardens. The 40-minute procession route winds through mostly business and government districts, passing by the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> buildings. Several facilities built for the 1964 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Olympics also are along the way. Clad in dark blue helmets and uniforms and wielding silver shields and nightsticks, the thousands of riot police along downtown streets are the most conspicuous evidence of the government's determination to maintain security A high-ranking official with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The situation requires security on an unprecedented scale.'' The government has $ 19 million to security, a quarter of the funeral budget. Police will undertake random searches of vehicles in areas around the gardens and palace, and check and reseal manholes. Frogmen will patrol the waters around one of the airports where dignitaries will arrive. The police official said about 26,000 police had been assigned to funeral security and that would be increased to 32,000 on the day of the funeral. There are about 220,000 police in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Security requirements have forced police to bring in officers from all over the country, but the official said 10,000 areas designated as possible terrorist targets are being given `` sufficient attention.'' `` We may suffer a blow, but not a knockout,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Newspapers have kept readers updated on what to expect when the day arrives, running reports on everything on traffic to the 253 temporary toilets along the funeral procession route.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful new Titan 4 rocket will carry a huge new missile-warning satellite when it blasts off on its maiden flight next month, an industry magazine reported Friday. Aviation Week & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> said the 5,200-pound satellite is the third generation of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Support Program payloads designed to give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instant alert of a missile attack. The magazine said in a report to be published in its Feb. 20 issue that nine of the new <ORGANIZATION> DSP </ORGANIZATION> satellites, costing $ 180 million each, will be launched over the next several years. It said the satellite has an advanced infrared telescope to detect the heat exhaust of a missile rising after launch from land or sea. While missile warning is the payload's primary role, <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> said the satellite also will provide intelligence on routine Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and space launches. It also is expected to be able to detect the heat from military aircraft when they fly with their afterburners on for higher speed. The magazine said the satellite has new survivability features, including a system to protect it from ground-based lasers. Thirteen early model <ORGANIZATION> DSP </ORGANIZATION> satellites have been launched by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> since 1971. The Titan 4, the largest of three rocket systems the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ordered to lessen its dependency on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s space shuttle after the 1986 Challenger explosion, is scheduled for launch in mid-March.

<TEXT>
 A $ 21.75 million jury award to <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover is `` clearly excessive'' and `` catastrophic,'' critics said, but others praised the verdict for sending a message about responsibility to those with AIDS Some lawyers were aghast at the size of the award to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, and one homosexual rights activist said he was concerned that the decision would wrongly free lovers of their responsibility to protect themselves against AIDS. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> was <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s homosexual lover before the actor died of AIDS on Oct. 5, 1985. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate and personal secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, saying they had caused him emotional anguish by failing to warn him that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had the fatal disease. Jurors found <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> engaged in `` outrageous conduct'' by failing to tell <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s diagnosis. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the case `` sends a dangerous message. It tells people that if they continue to bury their heads in the sand by engaging in unsafe sex and become infected, it's entirely their partner's fault and they do n't bear any responsibility.'' `` While we understand the jury's sympathy for the plaintiff, the precedent their award establishes is catastrophic,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>. `` What the jury's done is award damages for fear, whether it's rational fear or not. Christian consistently has tested negative for infection with the AIDS virus. His lawyer said that's no guarantee he wo n't eventually develop AIDS because of his sexual liaisons with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, the issue is irrelevant, said attorney <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, author of `` Lovers, Doctors & amp; the Law,'' and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, legal director for the Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` In -LRB- many -RRB- other jurisdictions, you have to show physical injury as well as emotional injury,'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, if you can prove ... emotional distress, you do not have to prove a tangible injury.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said the jury was right to side with Christian, but added: `` The damages seem a bit high ... when you compare it with someone who may be paralyzed for life and may get a lot less money.'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the `` larger-than-anticipated'' award `` sends a really serious symbolic message to all lovers. The person who is going to mislead a sexual partner is really going to think twice before they tell a lie.'' <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said he was concerned that the case `` opens the door to a variety of spurious lawsuits'' by angry lovers. Dr. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schram </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS task force, called the award `` clearly excessive'' since Christian apparently was n't infected, and put the blame for <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s actions on `` <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was required all his life to be sexually dishonest in order to be successful,'' <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said. `` He had to remain in the closet. As long as society continues to tell people to hate themselves for their sexuality, then it's hard to expect them to respect their sexual partners and be honest.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the heart of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, home of fantastic foie gras and sublime sauces, Americans can satisfy an urge for pumpkin pie, peanut butter, creamed corn and even Cheerios. But The General Store is more than just a kitchen away from home for expatriates. Its operators, <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON>, say it is increasingly popular with the French, who are developing a taste for American food. <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON> is French and his wife is from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, but they know a lot about cranberry sauce, chocolate chip cookies, taco shells and molasses. They got hooked on American fare when <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> was a commodities trader in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1976 to 1984. `` The European idea of American food is built on preconceived notions and prejudices, mostly developed from lack of knowledge and being exposed to the fast-food craze,'' <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON>, 46, said recently as he served customers. `` There is more to American food than burgers and hot dogs.'' When the <PERSON> Bourbeillons </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, they made a list of foods, `` a good representative idea of what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has to offer, regional products like maple syrup and clam chowder from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and Tex-Mex from the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. They opened the store three years ago, and their clientele is split evenly between Americans and the French. `` There has always been a love-hate relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The French have always had a tremendous fascination with anything American,'' <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON> said. A French woman, <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, entered the store on a narrow Left Bank street for a look around, and bought a bottle of bleu cheese salad dressing and a jar of blueberry chutney. `` I'm curious about the tastes of other countries,'' she said. `` Today, I'm concentrating on typical American tastes. I'm here looking for sauces.'' Many customers come for the fresh brownies, cookies and pies <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> bakes daily. `` In the beginning, we got a lot of press like we were some oddball operation, selling <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wine to the French,'' <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON> said. `` But the French have moved from a kind of amused interest to a genuine liking for American food. `` And there are other trends. The French are taking to brunches and are starting to like making pancakes, or having a chili dinner for 20. It's becoming an accepted thing to do, at least in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.'' Said Mrs. <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON>: `` It is a change in attitude and a new way of life. I do n't think it's a passing trend. It is an evolution.'' The General Store is busiest at Thanksgiving. `` Last year we discovered we were becoming famous,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON> said. `` The year before we did turkey for the first time, with all the fixings, plus pastry, pumpkin and pecan pies. This year we produced literally hundreds'' of meals. Demand was so great that they joined forces with a poultry dealer down the street. Mrs. <PERSON> Bourbeillon </PERSON> furnished a sage stuffing recipe and a neighbor cooked the turkeys while she baked the pies. `` He kept running up here with pans of it for tasting sessions,'' she said. `` For the French we had to tell them what to do with the yams and cranberry sauce. We gave out little recipes. It was a lot of fun,'' she said.

 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swayed, sang and won legions of young fans Friday as she participated in an elementary school assembly celebrating Black History Month. `` When I get home I'm going to scream and tell my mommy,'' said <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 8, a glee club member at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` We liked her very much. We want her to come back,'' said <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON>, 10. `` We hope she'll come back again with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, serving a low-income neighborhood dotted with dilapidated houses, empty lots and convenience stores, is part of a matching grant enrichment program for needy schools sponsored by the private <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has belonged to the group for six years. `` We know you are our friend,'' school principal <PERSON> Harriette </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, citing her service in the parent group `` long before you became Mrs. President. We are honored and we hope you will return to our school many times.'' Added the principal: `` For 11 years I have told the boys and girls that what they do will someday be seen and heard around the world. This is the beginning.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to the school was kept secret until right before the assembly. Students were not told in advance in order to keep scores of parents and neighbors from cramming the small auditorium and also `` to cut down on the tension,'' said glee club director <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. The first lady, dressed in her trademark royal blue and triple strand of pearls, drew cheers and a standing ovation from the 500 students as she entered the auditorium. From a third-row seat between two little girls, she watched attentively as students using a white wig, a cane, a stethoscope, a lab coat and a cleric's robe discuss the contributions of black Americans ranging from <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> brought down the house with a ringing excerpt from <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s `` I Have a Dream'' speech. Other parts of the program featured poetry, an autoharp rendition of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>'s `` Entertainer'' rag, a dance to the song `` A Change is Going To Come,'' and two spirituals performed by the school glee club Kindergarten student <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGriff </PERSON>, speaking in a nervous monotone, asked Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to come up to the stage and presented her with gifts _ a book by children involved in the `` Writing to Read'' program and a bright green T-shirt, bookbag and pencils with the school's name. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held the T-shirt up to her chest and complimented all of the performers, then gave <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> a book for the school library _ `` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Could </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fly </ORGANIZATION>, An American Black Folk Tale.'' `` If you work hard, if you try very hard, all of us can fly,'' said the first lady, a longtime advocate of literacy programs such as `` Writing to Read.'' At the end of the assembly, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained onstage and sang six verses of `` We Shall Overcome,'' holding hands and swaying with members of the glee club beneath a sign that said `` Believe It ... Achieve It.'' As she left she shook some outstretched hands and waved to others.

 The federal government authorized an attempt Friday to rescue a bottlenose dolphin from the chilly waters of <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> because the young mammal has been losing weight, officials said. A seven-member team from <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, planned to try to trap the dolphin in a net during low tide and move it by truck or plane to Sea World for rehabilitation. `` This is for the animal's best health and welfare at this time,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` He may well be able to survive the rest of the winter, I do n't know. But our fear is that he may not and we may have a real sick dolphin on our hands at a later date.'' The service decided the animal, nicknamed Rascal, should be rescued before it develops pneumonia or other ailments, he said. The dolphin, which weighs about 250 pounds and is about 6 feet long, stayed in <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> months after other dolphins migrated south. The animal eluded rescue efforts in December. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, curator of mammals at <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected the dolphin would be easier to capture now because it has become familiar with humans who have visited daily to check on its condition.

 The nation's largest bookseller, Waldenbooks, ordered `` The Satanic Verses'' off store shelves for fear that threats of violence against the book's author and publisher might extend to its employees. But the book was missing from many bookstore shelves today for another reason: Sales were booming. `` This is not a freedom of speech issue _ the sole reason is the protection of our employees,'' <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Predd </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Waldenbooks </ORGANIZATION>, said after the chain ordered its copies removed from display Thursday. `` Waldenbooks has fought long and hard against censorship, but when it comes to the safety of Waldenbooks employees and our customers, we must act responsibly in their interests,'' said a statement read today by <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castricone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waldenbooks </ORGANIZATION>' marketing department. Telephone calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to Waldenbooks stores nationwide Thursday night found that the <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> novel _ which provoked the Iranian leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, to call for the author's death _ was available for sale on request in a few stores, but was not on display. Employees answering the telephone at most stores said they had been instructed by corporate headquarters to say `` No comment'' to any questions about the book. A woman in the president's office at <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Waldenbooks </ORGANIZATION> said today that the decision to pull the book from public display was made Wednesday night `` when our store managers received some threats.'' The woman said she would n't give her name, adding, `` Everybody here is concerned about their safety.'' In <LOCATION> Forestville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a Waldenbooks store reported receiving a telephone bomb threat from an unidentified man who wanted it to stop selling the book, authorities said. The threat was made against the <ORGANIZATION> Waldenbooks </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> on Thursday, said <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. The store received the call from a man with a foreign accent who said a bomb would be detonated later that day if the store did n't pull the book from its shelves But store officials said they never had the novel in stock. Other bookstores said they could n't keep up with demand for `` The Satanic Verses,'' which was selling poorly before the death threat. `` We had a display of it for three weeks and it just sat there,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON>, manager of Bookstop in <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't remember selling one off it. Then, like that, they were gone.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Weese </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Encore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, Pa.-based chain of 47 stores in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said several of his outlets have sold out their allotment. `` The fist-shaking is happening elsewhere, thank God,'' <PERSON> Weese </PERSON> said. `` The ironic thing is that it's working against what <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and others want to accomplish. It's piqued everyone's interest and sparked the sales, rather than forcing people to remove it and not sell it.'' Seven people died this week in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during riotous protests against the book, which some Moslems say blasphemes the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. The book has been banned in several countries with mostly Moslem populations. Today was to be the start of an 11-city promotional tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, but the book's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penguin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, canceled the tour because of the threats. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, was reported to be in hiding. Viking Penguin executives were wearing bulletproof vests at the office, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reported today, citing unidentified sources. And Thursday the company received its ninth bomb threat since December. Workers were sent home and told to stay there today, too. The novel, published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September, has been available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for several weeks. About 10,000 copies of the book were distributed to Waldenbooks stores in 660 cities nationwide, <PERSON> Predd </PERSON> said. A memorandum authorized by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, president of the company, was sent to all the stores ordering the book off the shelves, she said. Viking Penguin began a second printing of the book last week, according to a company spokesman. The first run was 50,000 copies. `` We're printing to meet demand,'' the spokesman said Thursday. He asked that his name not be used, citing the bomb threats at the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. He said the $ 19.95 hardcover has hit four regional best-seller lists _ in this week's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and next week's <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. A fast-selling book usually gets special treatment from retailers _ window displays, a separate table or a prominent place on shelves. Some booksellers said the uproar would n't deter them. `` No book should be banned from sale for the ideas it contains,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bills </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. He said an unidentified group called him Tuesday to urge that an `` offensive'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> display be removed from the shop window, but he refused. Of five large midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bookstores, only a <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Noble outlet on Fifth Avenue had copies left Thursday. `` I do n't have it in the window, but I have it prominently displayed on both floors,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrowsky </PERSON>, the store's assistant manager `` There's some concern, but it's not stopping any kind of merchandising.'' <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON>, manager of the Classic Book Shop a block away, said she scrounged up 15 copies of the book Wednesday morning but they were sold in hours. `` Everybody's talking about it, everyone wants to read it,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 1 million to repair the USS Spruance, a destroyer that ran aground on a coral reef in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> last month, officials said. Repairs began this week at <ORGANIZATION> Ingalls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and should be completed this month, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>. The ship's propellers and propeller hubs will be repaired, as well as the mast, which was damaged due to windy weather and high seas during the grounding, <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Say Alcohol Labeling Rules Too Lax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer groups say temporary regulations governing the size and placement of warning labels to be printed on alcoholic beverage containers are too lax to ensure that people will notice them. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday published the rules on the warning labels, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year voted to require on alcoholic beverages sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> starting next November. The regulations say the print in the labels must be at least 2 millimeters high for containers larger than 8 ounces, and at least 1 millimeter for smaller containers. The warnings must be placed on the brand label, a separate front label or on a back or side label. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, of the private, non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the regulations serve `` the interests of the booze industry _ not the public.'' `` It's ridiculous to allow companies who fought labeling requirements for the past 20 years to print labels in tiny script any which way on the back or side of a bottle,'' she said. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubinski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> said the bureau had `` missed another opportunity to promote the public's health. The public has 45 days to comment on the temporary regulations, after which final rules will be published. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the labeling requirement in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` if the final regulations allow industry members to place minuscule labels in difficult-to-find places on the containers, the purpose of the law has been defeated.'' The labels warn that women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects, and caution that drinking alcoholic beverages impairs the ability to drive a car or operate machinery and can cause health problems.

<TEXT>
 A jury today awarded $ 7.25 million in additional damages to <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover, who had already received an award of $ 14.5 million because the movie star failed to reveal he had AIDS. The jury's decision on punitive and exemplary damages found that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s secretary and confidant, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, acted `` with malice'' and intended to cause injury to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> when he failed to tell <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had the deadly disease. `` If <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had told me he had AIDS, none of us would be here today,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said as he left the courtroom. Christian has not been diagnosed with AIDS. He said he believes that times have changed and gay men do not now keep the kind of secrets that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> kept from him. `` This is 1989 and everybody has to take precautions for themselves,'' he said. `` I hope that no one will be as naive as I was in 1983.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, called the size of the award `` outrageous'' and said he would file a motion to have it thrown out or reduced. He said it was `` a good bet'' he would appeal. Some legal experts denounced the $ 14.5 million in compensatory damages _ $ 3.5 million more than the lawsuit asked for _ as excessive, but a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> had urged jurors Thursday to add another $ 14.5 million to the judgment in punitive and exemplary damages. The jury today awarded him half of that amount, for a total of $ 21.75 million. The jury answered three questions in its verdict, all of them `` yes.'' The questions asked whether they found that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> intended to injure <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, that he acted with a `` willful and conscious'' disregard for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s safety and whether <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s fraudulent conduct deprived Christian of a legal right or any other injury. The jury decided Wednesday that <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were guilty of `` outrageous conduct'' by deliberately hiding <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s AIDS diagnosis from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> while <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> continued to have unprotected sex. The jury returned Thursday to begin the next phase in the two-month trial: <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s request for punitive and exemplary damages from <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Only <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is named because state law prohibits such damages being awarded from an estate. `` You have the opportunity to save the lives of untold millions. You must surely be blessed,'' Christian's lawyer, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, told the jury. But Banks, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s attorney, told jurors to be cautious and `` go slowly'' in deciding. Banks urged the panel not to vent anger at <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> by penalizing <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 63, the secretary who also served as <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s friend and confidante for 35 years. `` He's not the person who had sex with <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. `` If you're angry at <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, I ask you to set all the feelings about <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> aside and consider <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. There is no need to hit <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> again.'' Christian, 35, said he did n't find out about <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s disease until it was announced to the world in July 1985. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> died three months later at age 58. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> sued the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> estate and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for $ 11 million, claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress and an `` enhanced fear'' that he too will die of AIDS. Those who disagreed with the jury's decision to award Christian $ 3.5 million more than he had asked for said it could set a dangerous precedent. `` I'm delighted with the message and I'm appalled at the size of the award,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freehling </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, called the verdict an `` awful decision.'' `` While we understand the jury's sympathy for the plaintiff, the precedent their award establishes is catastrophic,'' <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said. `` They've awarded for an injury that has n't yet occurred. ... What the jury's done is award damages for fear, whether it's rational fear or not.'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> told jurors that doubling the damages would send a message to the world that lovers ca n't keep secrets about AIDS without risking legal consequences. `` If you bring in a verdict like the one you brought in yesterday, you know the world is going to know about it,'' he told the jury. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s lawyer countered that the message already was sent. `` It's echoed around the world,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. `` Now please exercise caution.''

 Japanese balloonist <PERSON> Fumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> is giving up his attempt to cross the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> alone because of uncooperative winds, and he plans to bring his craft down on the sea, officials said Friday. Project spokesman <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said an airplane would determine <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>'s location early Saturday, and that <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> then planned to bring his giant orange-and-blue balloon down to wait for a ship to pick him up. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> lifted off early Wednesday from his hometown of <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> with the goal of becoming the first person to travel 5,000 miles across the ocean alone in a balloon. But the flight was frustrated from the start by winds that blew to the north rather than to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> had hoped to land on Sunday. On Friday, his craft floated 4.4 miles above the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> about 1,450 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said waves in the area were estimated at 20 feet in height, and that <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> might not be able to bring down the craft until they subsided. Although the six-foot plastic gondola carrying <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> can float, high waves would batter it and possibly hide it from rescuers, <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said. Japanese marine officials said no boats were in the area and that a coast guard ship would not arrive until Sunday night. If the high waves did subside and <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> brought down the balloon, he could be left bobbing in the ocean for more than a day. `` He should be able to survive for an extended period, but the gondola will rock a great deal,'' <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said. `` He's likely to become very seasick.'' <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>, an experienced balloonist, had hoped to travel to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in about four days with the help of high-speed, high-altitude winds that generally blow west to east. But after the launch, the winds shifted north toward <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> stayed at a low altitude initially in an attempt to travel south and then catch the southernmost edge of the jet stream, which might have landed him farther south in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He then jettisoned most of his ballast and rose in altitude, but missed the high-speed winds, said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, another project spokesman. `` The loss of the ballast means he no longer is able to maneuver up and down to find a good wind,'' <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>, 38, quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to prepare for the flight. He estimated the flight would cost about $ 540,000, a sum he hoped to recoup through a book and lectures about his experience. In 1981, four men successfully crossed the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> by balloon for the first time, but no one has traveled the distance alone.

 Authorities on Friday lifted a curfew called to quell ethnic violence after national elections gave the party of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> another majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of workers crowded the streets of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital, on their way to work Friday after the curfew ended at 5 a.m. It was called Thursday morning to forestall ethnic attacks during vote-counting from Wednesday's elections. Military officials said there had been no reports of major trouble during the curfew, which confined most people to their homes. At least 56 people were killed on election day. During the five-week campaign, more than 1,000 people were killed by Sinhalese extremists and Tamil separatists, police said. Both groups had vowed to disrupt the elections. Despite attacks and death threats, 63 percent of 9.3 million eligible voters turned out. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 125 of the 225 Parliament seats, called his election victory a `` decisive mandate'' for restoring law and order on this island off the southern tip of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> failed to gain the two-thirds majority he wanted to ensure passage of legislation to implement his anti-poverty program, which he considers a key element in ending the bloodshed. The minority Tamil rebels opposed the elections because they are fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government for a homeland. Their struggle has created a backlash among Sinhalese extremists, who say the government has given too much to the Tamils. Sinhalese account for 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and dominate the government and military. Tamils, who make up 18 percent, say they suffer discrimination in jobs and education.

 The Iran-Contra trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> has been set to begin Tuesday morning, officials at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse said today. Problems have been worked out over the use of classified material that <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to introduce in his defense, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is telling the jury to report at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. A jury of nine women and three men was chosen Feb. 9, the same day the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began trying to delay the trial. The department lifted its objections on Wednesday after receiving assurances from independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, whose office is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, that classified material would be protected. A stay of the trial granted last Sunday by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> was vacated Thursday. Meanwhile today, a closed-door courtroom fight continued over how the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's quid pro quo arrangements with third countries to provide aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels are to be presented at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers say the government is refusing to admit that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top administration officials hid a policy of offering inducements to third countries for their support of the Contras. In a court filing Wednesday that was made public today, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` fails _ for the fourth time _ to acknowledge'' that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other officials established a policy that `` the quid pro quo and other third-country arrangements would not be disclosed. The filing by lawyers <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> reflects the courtroom fight that was continuing today behind closed doors as <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers push for greater disclosures of arrangements which they have called the heart of the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has said he will accept an admission of fact from the government on the arrangements rather than allowing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to present the matter in detail in open court. The issue involves substantial amounts of classified material. In its proposed admission, the government on Tuesday suggested that `` North alone was responsible for devising a means of concealing a quid pro quo arrangement from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said They said the independent counsel's proposed submission on that point `` is grossly misleading and patently inadequate.'' `` If the defense must be satisfied with a cold admission on the quid pro quo issue _ and must give up its right to present the many documents and the extensive live testimony that would bring the issue to life for the jury _ then it must also have an admission on the non-disclosure policy,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. They insisted that information be included `` setting forth particular instances in which executive branch officials withheld information concerning quid pro quo and other third-country arrangements.'' North's attorneys also said they want to supplement the government's admission with specifics of inducements the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered third countries to persuade them to support the Contras. They also saidthe names of the Central American countries involved in the arrangements must be disclosed at trial. North's lawyers are opposing a plan in which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> would notify Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> any time particularly sensitive classified material is about to be disclosed. The defense says the procedure `` would impose intolerable burdens on the court, the witnesses and the jurors.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to stay out of the Iran-Contra case, saying it was up to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to prevent the introduction of classified information. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, in meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, then worked out the notification plan. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says his procedure implements the judge's order directing that the attorney general stay out of the case, but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has made no comment on it. Despite <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s rulings, the proposed plan gives the attorney general too much influence, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and fellow defense attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in a court brief. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the defense motion `` is based on a misconception.'' `` Independent counsel does not contemplate the trifling ` bits and pieces' activity by the attorney general'' which North `` professes to anticipate,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` The day-to-day conduct of this case will be by the independent counsel and only the independent counsel.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that he turns to the attorney general just as he turns on occasion to other government agencies and that as long as the agencies do n't attempt `` to intrude in the courtroom,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> has no basis for objection. The North trial was delayed this week because the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, fearful that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would spill government secrets in the courtroom, obtained a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> stay of the proceedings. The court vacated the stay Thursday, after <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said sufficient safeguards were in place to protect national security.

 The delayed criminal trial of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> will begin next Tuesday, court officials said Friday after final rules for disclosure of national secrets were ironed out. There was no word directly from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, but the officials said the last problems over guidelines for handling classified information were resolved in closed meetings Thursday and Friday. The officials spoke on condition that they not be identified. Details of the resolution were not immediately announced. Jury selection was begun on Jan. 31 and finished on Feb. 9, but that same day the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began efforts to delay the trial because of concerns that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s rules for national security materials were not tight enough. The department lifted its objections Wednesday after receiving assurances from independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, whose office is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, that undisclosable secrets will be protected. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> and chief defense lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will deliver their opening statements on Tuesday after the jury is sworn. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers argued Friday that the jury must hear evidence during the trial that he was under White House orders not to disclose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offers of favors to countries that helped arm the Nicaraguan Contras. Most of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, involve hiding from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general what the administration was doing to help the Contras. Because of national security secrets that swirl through material that may be made public during the trial, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has to decide in advance what can and what can not be presented to the jury. One of the stickiest of those matters concerns the deals that may have been struck with third countries for Contra aid. North's defense includes a contention that he was authorized to do everything he did in diverting profits from <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> arms sales to help the Contras fighting the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has said he will allow the government to make a general `` admission'' to the jury about the tit-for-tat arrangements rather than allowing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to present the matter in detail. The issue involves substantial amounts of classified material. `` An admission forces the defense to forgo the presentation of powerful evidence to the jury,'' North attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in a court filing. `` In return the defense is entitled to a full and candid concession of the basic facts that that evidence would prove, together with the inference to be drawn from those basic facts.'' The prosecution fails to acknowledge `` for the fourth time'' that former president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other officials established a policy that `` the quid pro quo and other third-country arrangements would not be disclosed,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. Quid pro quo means something-for-something, or an exchange of favors. In its proposed admission, the government on Tuesday suggested that in one instance `` North alone was responsible for devising a means of concealing a quid pro quo arrangement from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` If the defense must be satisfied with a cold admission on the quid pro quo issue _ and must give up its right to present the many documents and the extensive live testimony that would bring the issue to life for the jury _ then it must also have an admission on the non-disclosure policy,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> proposed that the prosecutor tell the jury in the first paragraph `` that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top administration officials'' established a do n't - He said also that the names of the Central American countries involved in the arrangements must be disclosed at trial. During the congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago, those countries were not publicly identified.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has appealed personally to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help bring peace to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> now that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has withdrawn, a top <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> diplomat said Friday. Both the diplomat and a Soviet general acknowleged at a news conference that the Soviets are worried about continued bloodshed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but rejected any parallels between their pullout and the 1973 withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` The Americans simply fled and abandoned everything when they left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varennikov </PERSON>, deputy defense minister and chief of Soviet ground forces. `` We did not abandon anything. We were not in a rush.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>, Soviet first deputy foreign minister, said an `` individual message'' from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seeks <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for Kremlin suggestions on how to achieve a political settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, including a halt in arms supplies to the U.S.-backed insurgents and the establishment of a broader-based government. `` We are proposing that we assist in a cease-fire,'' said <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON>, referring to the joint superpower action sought by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We consider that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can always play a positive role.'' In what appeared to be a wide-ranging <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> effort to prevent the violent overthrow of the pro-Moscow government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the Soviets also sent messages to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> asking them to give humanitarian and economic assistance to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> said. Messages were also sent to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which have given weapons and other support to the guerrillas. Western diplomats and the insurgents have predicted <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government will fall soon now that the Soviets are gone The last of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 115,000 soldiers that had been stationed there returned home Wednesday. <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> said the withdrawal had created an `` extraordinary opportunity'' to end <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s nearly 11-year-old civil war, sparked by the April 1978 coup in which the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> seized power The Soviets sent tanks and troops in the following year. `` We believe all countries should respond to the emerging opportunity to put an end to the drawn-out conflict by promoting the complete and fast settlement of the situation and the reinstatement of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as a prosperous, strong, independent, neutral and non-aligned nation,'' <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> said. The message to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was delivered to the White House on Friday by Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> at the time, did not have a chance to read the full letter, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the message from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` generally repeats their public position.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not want to be more specific about the contents, although he noted the Soviet message did reiterate `` their public positions about ending support for the rebels.'' `` We do n't have a detailed response. We just received the letter. But our concerns remain the same,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he hoped the pullout would ensure `` no more bloodbaths'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> call for an immediate cease-fire and an arms embargo. He said he could not endorse those measures because he was concerned that the retreating Soviets might have left behind a `` tremendous amount'' of weapons and ammunition for their Afghan allies. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, there was a massive stockpiling of weapons in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the Soviets recently, and they handed over to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s forces fighter aircraft and helicopters, dozens of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers and hundreds of transport vehicles. <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> seemed at pains to put the best possible cast on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements when he said the Soviets were encouraged by the president's omission of any mention of continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms supplies to the guerrillas. He said the Soviets would like to take <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s words `` at face value.'' Later Friday, a senior official on Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plane said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons shipments to Moslem guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be continued even if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ceased its support for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. `` As long as the mujahedeen are fighting for the right of self-determination, we should assist that effort,'' the official said. <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> also did not repeat Kremlin charges the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was violating the U.N.-brokered accords that led to the Soviet pullout by shipping weapons to the insurgents. The departure of Soviet soldiers at a time of political uncertainty has led some in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to see similarities with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where communist forces seized power in 1975, three years after the departure of the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops. `` There can be no parallels here,'' said <PERSON> Varennikov </PERSON>, who previously served as the representative of the Soviet military command in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Now that Soviet troops have gone, we have left behind an integral and free state which is unfortunately still engaged in a war against bands that are still aggressive.'' <PERSON> Varennikov </PERSON> also said 30 Soviet military advisers remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a bilateral Soviet-Afghan agreement. `` These are mostly Soviet military experts who will provide various kinds of needed assistance and ensure the landing of Soviet planes bringing food and other goods to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Varennikov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. He said the advisers were not attached to Afghan military units, but to its government.

<HEAD>Rivers Crest Across Kentucky, But Tennessee Gets Fifth Day Of Rain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One town was an island and unknown number of people were homeless Friday in flood-stricken <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where several swollen rivers crested and began to recede, and sodden areas of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> got a fifth consecutive day of rain. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> made another tour of flooded areas Friday and was expected to seek a federal disaster declaration to make the state eligible for federal assistance. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> asked for similar relief Thursday. The two states have gotten a week of rain, more than 10 inches in some places, that flooded roads, closed schools and some businesses and claimed at least three lives. While the region is part of the area affected by last summer's drought, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> farmers worried that the heavy rain could harm their winter wheat crops, planted last fall for harvest this year The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said several <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> streams had crested, although the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s northern border, and the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> continued rising. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a weather service hydrologist, said the broad <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> could force some river levels higher again when its high water backs up into lower streams. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s capital city, <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, got a break Friday when the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> finally stopped rising, cresting 13.2 feet above flood stage at 44.2 feet. <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said officials were still trying to determine how many people were left homeless by the flood, but there was no firm count because most evacuees moved in with friends or relatives. He said there was water in several hundred buildings in the city, but the state Capital complex was high and dry. The city's civic center was packed with evacuees' furniture and other belongings. The forecast was a chance of light snow or rain through Saturday, with temperatures dropping. Hardest hit in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> was the tiny town of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, about 23 miles south of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, which became an island Thursday when the last road into town was flooded. The Rolling Fork of the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reached a record-tying 51.7 feet, well above flood stage of 35 feet. Conditions in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> wo n't improve significantly until the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> crests at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, 23 miles north, and allows the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to begin draining, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said Friday. `` We've got plenty of food. As long as nobody gets sick, we're all right,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandiver </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for 32 years Rain fell Friday for the fifth straight day in much of western and central <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and more rain was forecast for Saturday. Since Monday in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> had received 5.29 inches of rain, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 5.24 inches and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> 5.30 inches. High water overloaded <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s sewage system and raw waste was flowing toward the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In flood-stricken <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s northwestern corner, the <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was receding after breaking a levee Thursday, unleashing 3 feet of water that forced 377 people from their homes in the towns of Obion and <PERSON> Rives </PERSON>. No injuries were reported, but at least 50 homes, two churches and a fire station were flooded and <ORGANIZATION> Rives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was closed. `` A lot of the houses that were damaged had as much as 3 feet of water in them, and state Highway 216 had to be closed because the pavement was uprooted by the water,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, an operations officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of the homes had up to 50 percent damage. It could be quite awhile before they get back into them.'' <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, along with neighboring <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> counties, account for a third of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s annual $ 73 million wheat crop, the state's fifth leading cash crop, state agriculture officials said. `` We'll experience some flooding in the wheat fields, but the loss wo n't be known until spring,'' he said. `` This could hurt the wheat crop if it continues. It needs to warm up and dry out.''

<HEAD>Militia Chief Withdraws Fighters After Threats From Army Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The commander of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main Christian militia ordered his fighters to withdraw from battle Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> chief threatened an `` apocalpyse'' to wipe them out. Lebanese Forces commander <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, who has been fighting for control of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> community, said he was willing to dissolve the militia if a conference of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> religious and political leaders asked him to. Intermittent duels with artillery and automatic weapons flared earlier in the Christian sector of the divided capital, despite a cease-fire signed Wednesday by <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the army chief. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said at least 13 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> were evacuated to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about 25 remained at the embassy, which the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says has been caught in a cross fire. The battles have deepened divisions in the Christian community in this nation already torn by 14 years of civil war between Christians and Moslems. In an effort to resolve the inter-Christian conflict peacefully, Maronite Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> held a conference attended by 21 leading Maronite leaders in <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> told reporters after the four-hour meeting: `` I am ordering all Lebanese Forces militiamen to withdraw from all fronts back to their barracks. Never again will we collide with the army.'' `` Whatever the general -LRB- <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> -RRB- wants, we'll do,'' <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said. Asked if he will be willing to dissolve the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said, `` If the <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> conferees say so, I will. But they have n't taken such a decision.'' He said he was prepared to pull his militia from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> if the Moslem sector was simultaneously brought under exclusive control of the Lebanese army. `` From now on, we and Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> are one hand,'' he declared. There was no immediate reaction from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who boycotted the meeting. A statement by the conferees said they had briefed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on the deliberations. The conferees resolved to consolidate the cease-fire, withdraw Lebanese Forces militiamen to their barracks and apply law and order across <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual Moslem-Christian government, told a news conference earlier the conditions that permitted the army to coexist with the militia no longer existed. `` We are responsible for the state, and they want a ministate ... Those who do not abide by the law, I'll crush their heads,'' said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, surrounded by senior officers of his 20,000-member predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he had accepted a cease-fire mediated by <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> on Wednesday only to allow political efforts to `` resolve the problem peacefully.'' `` Otherwise, it will be total destruction. This time it will be an apocalypse,'' he said. Shortly after the news conference, the army announced that 2nd Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> was killed by sniper fire from Lebanese Forces positions in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. That brought the death toll to 70 in fighting that broke out late Tuesday. At least 197 people were wounded. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the Lebanese Forces should compensate the people for the damage and casualties out of taxes the militia levies. He said the militia charges about $ 400,000 a day in illegal taxation of various businesses in the 310-square-mile enclave that houses 1 million Christians. The Lebanese Forces and the various Moslem and leftist militias have been collecting taxes in their respective areas of influence since the civil war broke out in 1975. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> accused the militia of starting the previous round of fighting, which involved an attack on his residence in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s posh suburb of <LOCATION> Rabieh </LOCATION> He said his forces `` confronted the attack,'' capturing five armored personnel carriers and their crews. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was named head of an interim military Cabinet by former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> minutes before <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired Sept. 22. Parliament has failed to elect a successor because Christians opposed the Syrian-backed candidates. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment violated an unwritten national covenant that gave the premiership to the Sunni Moslems, the presidency to the Maronites and the house speakership to the Shiite Moslems.

<HEAD>Bush, Congressional Leaders Set Face-to-Face Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday that fledgling talks with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on his $ 1.16 trillion spending plan are making progress and he will sit down with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders next week to push for `` a quick and early resolution to this budget crisis.'' The president said top Democrats and Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will come to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, the eve of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s departure on a five-day trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the session was intended to keep the momentum of budget talks going while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was out of the country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the conference with congressional leaders during a speech before students at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, his third address in a week on the budget. He got a warm reception in the university field house, though outside his motorcade encountered handfuls of demonstrators against his anti-abortion stance. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once again failed to offer a formula to produce the $ 9.6 billion to $ 11 billion in budget cuts needed to offset the cost of his commitments for new spending on domestic programs such as education, child care, the homeless and cleaning up the environment. `` There are certain priorities that demand attention,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Yes, we can afford to increase spending _ modestly, selectively but only after tough choices are made.'' Democrats have complained that the president is taking credit for expanding social spending while making <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take responsibility for finding ways to pay for it. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave an upbeat assessment of the budget talks, which are in their infancy, saying `` We are making progress.'' Suggesting he would share responsibility with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` Together, we've got to make the budget process work.'' `` I am committed to working closely with my friends on the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> to help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law for an April 15th budget resolution,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for a deficit in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 of no more than $ 100 billion _ down from an estimated $ 160 billion this year. Failure by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to meet the target could result in across-the-board cuts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted congressional leaders `` to come meet with me and in a spirit of bipartisanship get on with the nation's business of getting a quick and early resolution to this budget crisis.'' In his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also stressed volunteerism _ one of his favorite themes. `` My friends, from now on in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> any definition of a successful life must include serving others, in child-care center, in the corporate boardroom, at the Rotary, at Little League, or a tutoring program, and in a church or synagogue,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. As for a federal role, he said, `` I know we can have a government with a heart as well as a head.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> struck a decidely different tone from his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who portrayed the government almost as an enemy. `` The government's contribution is critical but by itself is insufficient to solve all of our national problems,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Yes, most Americans believe that our efforts must reach beyond government, to care about our communities and to assist our neighbors,'' the president said. `` But they also believe that government can be an important catalyst in that process of helping individuals, our communities and our nation.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said participants at Tuesday's budget meeting will include <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash.; Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and the senior Democrats and Republicans from the congressional budget, finance and Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, budget chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> also will take part. After the speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch with about two dozen people, including students, senior citizens and participants in the Special Olympics programs. The president would not respond to questions by reporters on a soon-to-be-released <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on the qualifications of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be defense secretary. `` We're not going to have any press questions. I'm not worried. I feel good today,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, congressional sources who requested anonymity said a review of a security clearance application by a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer included allegations about Tower's behavior as the head of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation to arms talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986. Among the allegations was one that Tower kept both his secretaries in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> as mistresses. On another subject, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> a letter to the president, delivered by Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, had arrived at the White House from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not had the opportunity to read the letter in full and that a response had not been prepared. The spokesman said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s message `` relates generally to the pullout of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It generally repeats their public position.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had sent messages to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other world leaders asking for help in ending the war between Afghan factions following the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pullout.

 The nation's largest bookseller, Waldenbooks, ordered `` The Satanic Verses'' off store shelves for fear that threats of violence against the book's author and publisher might extend to its employees. But the book was missing from many bookstore shelves today for another reason: Sales were booming. `` This is not a freedom of speech issue _ the sole reason is the protection of our employees,'' <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Predd </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Waldenbooks </ORGANIZATION>, said after the chain ordered its copies removed from display Thursday. `` We've fought long and hard against censorship,'' <PERSON> Predd </PERSON> was quoted as saying in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` But when it comes to the safety of our employees, one sometimes has to compromise.''

<HEAD>Dairy Herds Free Of Pesticide; Lost Dreams And Lawsuits Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAVE SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nature slowly cleansed their dairy herds of heptachlor, but a legacy of lost dreams and lawsuits endures for Ozarks farmers who unwittingly bought the banned pesticide in cheap livestock feed. `` Most have survived all this, but they are a lot worse off now financially than they were before,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who filed lawsuits for some farmers. `` I've sat at their kitchen tables and seen them cry.'' A settlement involving 48 farmers expected this month would close out a saga of deceit, confusion and fear that began in the mid-1980s when heptachlor-treated seed was fermented to make gasohol and the resulting mash was illegally sold as feed. The government recalled milk and quarantined farms. `` We are in the final throes of the final settlement with the final defendants,'' said attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Siloam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. None of the attorneys for farmers will disclose details of any settlements, but <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON> said this final one would `` come pretty darn close'' to adequately compensating his clients. `` Some of these farmers were in their 50s and 60s, and dairies had been their entire livelihood,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hignight </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` Then, all of a sudden, you've still got all your expenses and you've got nothing coming in and everything's going out.'' <PERSON> Hignight </PERSON> had advised against buying the mash that was sold by J.E.W. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, not because of contamination _ knowledge of that did n't come until later _ but because its high water content cut cost-effectiveness. But to farmers who bought the mash in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the price seemed right. Tons were consumed here in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' top dairy county. Farmers' delight at finding an inexpensive feed source turned to shock, then helplessness, in March 1986 when tests showed their dairy products were tainted with the suspected carcinogen banned in 1983 for general use. Authorities recalled dairy products in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and warned nursing mothers not to drink milk. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> quarantined more than 130 dairy herds in the three states where the feed was sold. `` I had to be more of a listening ear than anything else, offering a couch for people to talk,'' said <PERSON> Hignight </PERSON>. `` A lot of times with these producers, all you could do was spend a little time with them.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> in this town between <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, lost $ 90,000 in sales when one quarantined dairyman turned to the turkey business. He is grateful more dairies were n't shut down. Many dairies were heptachlor-free, and the quarantine eventually was lifted for all but 137 herds in the three states. Most herds were declared clear of contamination within 18 months. But with nature's slow flushing of the heptachlor, a few herds emerged from the ban only last fall. Heptachlor settles in fatty tissues, and the only way to purge it from cattle is milking _ a frustrating task for farmers who poured the frothy fresh product onto pastures. `` For well over a year and a half, that's all they did _ milk and dump, because they were unable to do anything else,'' <PERSON> Hignight </PERSON> said. As the farmers searched for answers, `` we had folks come in with black magic and everything else that would cure you out in two weeks, and really sold them a bill of goods.'' One such `` cure'' proved to be charcoal, `` and they got people to buy it at a time when they already had their feet kicked out from under them,'' he said. `` All I remember is it was outrageous beyond reason.'' Diversification saved some families, and scores got low-interest loans from cooperatives that marketed their milk. They were repaid when farmers got loans from the federal Dairy Indemnity Fund. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paid more than $ 5.2 million to farmers in the three states _ $ 3.4 million to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, $ 1.3 million to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and $ 524,000 to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Court judgments to farmers allowed them to repay the fund about $ 480,000 by early this month, said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Domire </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON> said the repayments are closer to $ 700,000, and that the remaining reimbursement is a critical issue in settling his sweeping lawsuit _ the largest filed. Participating in the proposed settlement, <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON> said, would be J.E.W. and Valley Feeds; <ORGANIZATION> Velsicol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which made heptachlor; <ORGANIZATION> Ceiba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Funk </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sold tainted grain to the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> companies; and <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a seed broker. In addition, four J.E.W. officers were convicted or pleaded guilty to a variety of charges including wire fraud and adulterating feed. The farmers, most of whom have been involved in settlements, wo n't talk about the case or their problems, but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said justice prevailed. `` It's just like me coming up here and taking your car away from you, and going to your house and burning your house down, and you get fired for it and you knew it was beyond your control. Where are you going to turn? `` This whole community felt it and it was a bad situation. But they are fighting back. They're fighters and they're going to make it.'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> agreed: `` It can take the heart out of a family, but one thing about farmers in general is they are tough and they are survivors. And these farmers will come back.''

<HEAD>Mysterious Orthodox Group Terrorizes Secular Israelis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new group of Jewish radicals is trying to enforce ultra-Orthodox religious beliefs by painting swastikas on the tombstones of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s founders and bombing sex shops and newspaper stands. Police say the mysterious group of Jewish activists is called the `` Keshet'' -LRB- `` Keepers of the Torah'' -RRB- and uses army-issued explosives, either stolen from army bases or supplied to them by military sympathizers. Their campaign, a renewal of the long battle against Israeli secular society by Orthodox fundamentalists, has included the planting of more than a dozen bombs and the tossing of a grenade into a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> sex shop. No one has been hurt in the attacks, partly because anonymous phone calls often warn in advance that bombs have been planted. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON>, an expert on Jewish radical groups, says <PERSON> Keshet </PERSON>'s activities are not intended to kill but to terrorize secular Israelis `` The Orthodox can use violence and beatings. Somebody can get burned by accident. But killing a Jew is taboo for them,'' said <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist. `` It's the outer side of what happens inside the Jewish Orthodox society,'' he said. `` There is much violence inside that society.'' <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said police are worried by the Keshet campaign. `` We treat them very seriously. After all, it's an underground Jewish organization, a terror group,'' he said. The Keshet campaign is based in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bnei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shearim </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, both Orthodox areas where the group's ideas find some sympathy. While the group's methods are denounced by many ultra-Orthodox Jews, most support <PERSON> Keshet </PERSON>'s aims of enforcing public observance of the Jewish Sabbath, the biblical rest day from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, and other religious commandments. In early February police raided ghetto-like <LOCATION> Mea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shearim </LOCATION> and 10 members of leading Orthodox families were detained. Less than a week later, a caller saying he was from <PERSON> Keshet </PERSON> warned of another bomb in a working-class neighborhood bordering <LOCATION> Mea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shearim </LOCATION>. The bomb was safely dismantled. The Keshet campaign began in August 1986 when the tombstone of <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzl </PERSON>, a pioneer of the Zionist idea of founding a Jewish state in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was defaced with swastikas on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herzl </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. This kind of activitiy stems from the ultra-Orthodox belief that the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not come into being until the Messiah appears. Attacks continued this past August with bombs set off at three newsstands selling secular newspapers in <LOCATION> Bnei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION>. A series of 10 bombs then were planted at similar targets, but anonymous phone calls have warned of the explosives. Among other activities blamed on Keshet were incendiary bombs found and dismantled under a bridge on the <LOCATION> Jerusalem-Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> highway Dec. 31. On Jan. 8, an assailant believed to be Orthodox hurled a grenade into a sex shop in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, damaging the shop but injuring no one. The attackers usually leave police no doubt who is responsible. On Feb. 6, the tombstone of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON> was defaced with swastikas at the <LOCATION> Sde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boker </LOCATION> communal farm where <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first premier had lived. It was signed: `` Keshet: Search for us.'' <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON> said the name <PERSON> Keshet </PERSON> has been around since the 1960s and is associated with earlier campaigns to close movie theaters and restaurants on the Sabbath, to protest autopsies or to stop archaeological digs seen as desecrating ancient Jewish graves. `` In the Orthodox circles, it's an idea, a concept. But there is an organization behind the concept,'' he said. `` I estimate that <PERSON> Keshet </PERSON> is a small group that organizes on an ad hoc basis.'' <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshi-Zahav </PERSON>, 30, who was arrested and released in connection with the police investigation of <LOCATION> Keshet </LOCATION>, said in a newspaper interview he doubted police could stop the attacks. `` Police ... think we have an underground. Many years ago, when we fought against autopsies, the activists were called Keshet. Today, there is no such thing,'' he was quoted as saying. `` We do n't have a chief of staff and officers,'' he said. `` But to mobilize men for the action at any time is of no problem to us. We are all soldiers in the Almighty's army.''

 Two weeks of skiing, boating, fishing or hiking in an unspoiled forest of pine and birch. That's what <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> offers as a vacation for hardened criminals serving prison time. The vacationers at <LOCATION> Gruvberget </LOCATION>, a former logging camp 125 miles north of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, are convicted murderers, rapists, drug dealers and other felons serving long-term sentences. `` We have the lowest walls of any prison in the world, but they are also the thickest,'' said director <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON>, referring to the 12 miles of hilly woodland to the nearest farm. Up to 30 prisoners at a time stay at the mountain retreat for two weeks, many with their wives and children. Prison officials number three, and none have weapons. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has one of the world's most liberal corrections systems; prisoners are called `` clients,'' furloughs are frequent and the accent is on rehabilitation. `` We want to give clients the opportunity to meet their wives and children outside the walls of prison, and to give them new ideas about life,'' said <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON>. `` This is a great place,'' said an American doing time for selling drugs. `` I've been learning cross-country skiing. Yesterday we went walking seven or eight kilometers -LRB- four or five miles -RRB- in the woods and had a cookout _ hot dogs. `` It's like a real vacation. It's helping us re-cement our relationship,'' he added, nodding toward his Swedish wife. The 45-year-old former social worker refused to give his name. `` Just call me <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, OK?'' He said he was a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> deserter and has been in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for 20 years. After completing one-third of their terms, prisoners are eligible for furloughs of up to 48 hours as often as six times a year. Most prisons have conjugal rooms for visits from wives or girlfriends, and marriage is not a visiting requirement. The furlough system was curtailed for a time after the escape in October 1987 of one <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s most notorious spies, <PERSON> Stig </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergling </PERSON>, who apparently slipped out of the country while home on a weekend furlough. The prison service reported 287 cases of prisoners returning late or drunk from the 8,951 furloughs granted in 1987, the latest year for which statistics are available. About 15,000 people were sentenced to prison that year, 8,000 to sentences of less than two months, and 1,500 for more than one year. No one has ever tried to escape from <LOCATION> Gruvberget </LOCATION>. The guests are given train tickets at their home prison and make their own way to the village. Since most are nearing parole, <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> said, it would make little sense to jeopardize the release. One recent day, skis were propped against the wooden two-story cottages, which were built in the 1950s for woodcutters and their families. Four men in jeans or jogging suits were lazing in winter sunshine. Two were with their wives, and children were crashing through the nearby woods. They were waiting for a gray prison bus to take them to a public ski slope about a half-hour away. The Prisons Administration bought the village 27 miles from <LOCATION> Ockelbo </LOCATION>, the nearest town, in 1968. A full-sized basketball gym and a small dining hall were added to the 22 existing buildings, including the loggers' cabins. It took four years before the authorities could override the skeptics and invite the first group of prisoners, <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> said. Neighboring villages `` were a little worried when we started,'' <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> said. `` Over the years they got used to us.'' About 1,100 prisoners a year spend time at the vacation camp. About twice that number apply, <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> said. They are selected on the basis of good behavior and a clean record on previous furloughs. Each two-week session is built around an activity theme. One popular course is `` dance and exercise,'' in which the prisoners do physical training, aerobics and learn ballroom dances. <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> said religious classes are often requested by men convicted of murder or manslaughter. Other sessions feature seminars in family life or resisting drugs. `` Mainly we try to teach them basic things: to cook, to dance or to walk in the woods with their children, which they have never done,'' <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> said. For the prisoners, furloughs and the special experience of Gruvberget are lifelines to the world outside the walls. `` If I could n't see my wife on the weekends, be with the kids a couple or three hours a week, be able to touch them, I'd lose contact with life,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> the American. `` In the States, if you get six years you'll sit for four, five or maybe all six,'' he said. `` And conjugal visits? Forget it. But that's what holds families together. If you have that kind of contact, you can get back into life again.''

 Four years ago, art conservator <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> helped uncover more than two dozen forged paintings worth more than $ 200,000. Now he wants to educate art consumers to spot the forgeries themselves, using works falsely attributed to Hoosier impressionist artists T.C. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> to illustrate his points in an exhibit at the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Museum of Art. `` Every major collector has gotten a few fakes,'' he said in a recent interview. `` In fact, you could say you're not a major collector until you've gotten a bad one.'' About five years ago works by the `` Hoosier Group'' of artists gained new popularity from a rekindled interest in regional art. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and the others were landscape and figure painters who had flourished at the turn of the century. While their paintings were greatly distributed in schools and libraries across the state, little was widely known about their individual styles. Those were perfect conditions for the forgeries, some of them badly done, to enter the market. <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON>, chief conservator at the museum since 1975, spotted his first forged <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> that year while the staff was preparing a show in conjunction with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Bicentennial. `` Immediately the sky seemed odd to me,'' he said of the painting, a landscape with a woman carrying a red umbrella. However, he suspected it was merely a poor restoration rather than a forgery, until a collector brought in the original of the same work a week later. `` It's like the light bulb turns on _ maybe there's more than I was thinking about,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> did not paint any exact duplicates ... not in landscapes. We were shocked.'' Nine years later, more <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> forgeries and some works by <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> began turning up. Some were betrayed by the odor of fresh paint, others were detected only through painstaking tests. City and state police investigations eventually led to guilty pleas on different charges by two art dealers, an artist and a local attorney. The captured forgeries were turned over to the museum to be kept off the market and used as educational tools. They form the basis for <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON>'s first exhibit, `` Is it Genuine? <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> and Forgery in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' which runs through March 19. `` It's a much more technical exhibition than you normally see,'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> said. `` I wanted to follow the methods we used when we did the investigation.'' The exhibit opens by defining fakes and forgeries and their methods and proceeds to examine how a bogus work can be discovered. Canvases and the stretchers used to spread them are examined, as are more sophisticated tools such as comparisons with ultraviolet light and radiograms. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> originals are displayed alongside the forgeries, and the differences are striking. The forged version of <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>'s classic `` Pleasant Run,'' for instance, deletes the bridge from the original and instead inserts a cabin. `` Some of these, the fraudulent ones, were not very good,'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> said. The forgeries sold for as much as $ 8,000 when their actual worth might be only a tenth of that sum. The exhibit concludes with a test in which museum-goers can try to pick five originals from five forgeries. `` I would hope we've done a service to the public who will be out there purchasing paintings,'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> said. As recently as two months ago, a forged <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> seascape was traded at an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> art auction, he said. `` I am certain we did not find them all. There are still some out there,'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> said. `` One still has to be careful, not only with <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, but with any painting.''

<HEAD>Someday a Pay Raise, But Not Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Someday, somehow, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to raise its pay. But for now, political paralysis is keeping the salary lid on for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members _ and for judges and top administration officials, too. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave up its 51 percent pay raise for fear of a voter rebellion, the action also froze salaries for 1,100 federal judges, 834 appointed officials who manage Cabinet and similar agencies, 7,000 top civil servants, 12,000 foreign service employes and 155 generals and admirals. The salary commission that recommended a $ 45,500 raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also proposed increases for judges, Cabinet officers and other appointed positions. They were part of the package that would have become effective automatically Feb. 8 if it had not been vetoed by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It was. The other salaries are pegged to those at the top. As <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once said, `` I'm sorry to have taken so many nice fellows over the side with me.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, then attorney general, was joking about President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s announcement that no member of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> would be on the 1964 Democratic ticket as vice presidential nominee. With its rejection of this year's pay raise, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have effectively scuttled the system under which salaries were proposed, by an appointed panel insulated against voter punishment for unpopular increases. The recommendations went to presidents who could reject or revise them. Then they were to take effect in 30 days unless the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> both said no. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> linked judicial and executive branch salaries to its own as part of the same system of political insulation. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had supported the raise, and when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> turned it down he said judicial salaries should be increased separately if not as part of the pay package. He said he would make a pay recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later in the year. `` I believe that some level of pay increase is in order and I will be working with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership to achieve that end,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But first, a cooling off period. Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, battered by both sides on the pay issue, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be looking at new pay plans any time soon. Judicial salaries are a particular problem, given the high price of lawyers these days. Federal district judges get the same $ 89,500 a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gets, and increasing numbers have been resigning their lifetime appointments in favor of private practice. While judicial salaries have been increased six times during the last decade, the raises represent just over half the increase in the cost of living. Judges complain that their real buying power has declined by one-third in the past 20 years. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likes the package approach that ties their salary increases to those of judges and other officials, on the safety-in-numbers theory that did n't work this time. That leaves <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the entire government, back at square one on the salary problem. The Constitution says congressional compensation is `` to be ascertained by law,'' which means by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still shrinks from the risk of voting to ascertain that it merits a raise. Former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be institutionally incapable of setting its own salary. `` It is the grand daddy conflict of interest of all time,'' he told the salary commission. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has proposed what he says would be a way out. He calls it `` the sign-in system,'' and says it is based on the notion that congressmen should be honest about their salaries. He's introduced a bill under which members would determine their own salaries, within a range between the current salary and the $ 135,000 a year the commission recommended. Each member would pick a number, announce it and be judged on it by constituents in the next election. It is an idea whose time is not likely to come, given the fact that choosing a raise individually would be even riskier than voting for one on the floor. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, a 30-year man who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he'd sign up for the maximum because he's worth it.

<HEAD>Fear Lives Next Door to D.C. Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eighty years ago, federal officials told the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to build its new prison in the rolling <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> hills 20 miles away, near <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>. Today, like an unwanted neighbor who refuses to move, the prison complex, badly overcrowded and antiquated, is a source of fear to residents in the suburbs that grew up around it. District officials say they've been blocked at every turn in attempts to ease the problems at the <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> corrections complex and there's little they can do. `` We've lost control,'' concedes <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peelie </PERSON>, one of the guards charged with keeping order among the 8,600 inmates. `` It's just that there are too many people here. `` We live on a powder keg,'' says neighbor <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON>, hoping her alarm system and the heavy locks on her backyard gates will protect her the next time someone escapes. `` Everybody wants everybody locked up, but not in their neighborhood,'' says <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the district's mayor. `` We have to do something.'' But what? <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has proposed building a new prison in the city, while also expanding <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>. Preservationists are trying to stop the proposed facility in the district; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials, led by their congressman, are blocking any expansion of the present prison. All the while, conditions inside the 200-acre complex grow ever worse. The prison is 1,400 prisoners over capacity and is expected to add at least 4,000 more inmates by the turn of the century. Men stand in line for hours at mealtime. Showers and toilets are in short supply. Recreational facilities are so scarce that some men sit around for lack of anything better to do. Two men sleep in cells built for one. `` The inmates are very uncomfortable and tempers are short,'' says a prison chaplain, the Rev. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` There are men who are cursing for attention and ca n't get it.'' It was such an eruption in tempers that drew the nation's attention hours after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sworn in as president Jan. 20 One inmate was stabbed to death; fires set by free-running prisoners destroyed two buildings. No one escaped. Twelve men did last year. Three are still at large _ one who was convicted of manslaugher and two who were serving time for first-degree murders. Residents of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, some of whom live within a block or two of the prison, say they've seen escaped inmates walking around their neighborhood at night. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> frets when her 5-year-old son plays outside her backyard and owns a Doberman pinscher to fend off intruders. `` I have guns,'' she adds, `` and if I need to protect myself or my son, I'll do it.'' District officials say such fears are exaggerated. `` People in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are so scared. But we have never had an incident in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>.'' says <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswomen <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. The escapees `` almost always go back to Southeast -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB-. If you watch the homes of their family and friends long enough, you'll usually find them.'' Beyond the daily concern about escapes, residents of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of the wealthiest counties anywere, wonder about the prison's future. So does the <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> administration, which has proposed spending $ 350 million over a decade to modernize <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>, expand the district's halfway house program and build a second prison near the city jail in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In all, those efforts would add 3,525 beds to the 7,200 that are considered capacity at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>. Much of the district's program focuses on <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>, where only 200 of 2,000 acres are utilized. `` The most appropriate place'' for a new prison, says Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, `` would be to build it in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' Wrong, says Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman whose district includes <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>. `` The situation at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> reached crisis proportions a decade ago and it has continued to deteriorate,'' <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said after last month's uprising. Last October, he succeeded in having <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deny the city's request for $ 45 million to build an 800-bed facility at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> While the city operates the prison, it is owned by the federal government, which would have to pay for any improvements. `` It's the only penal institution in the nation that's located outside the political boundaries it's supposed to serve,'' <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> says. `` I think the penal requirements of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> are best served by the construction of a new and modern facility within the district. ... But, like a sewage plant or a dump or anything else, nobody wants it in their neighborhoods.'' At least not those near the city jail, who obtained a historic designation for the site of the proposed second prison, delaying officials' plans. Late last year, however, the city's <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rejected the community group's arguments. Officials now hope to begin construction this spring. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 50 million for a new prison three years ago. With the delays, says Ms. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, `` I'm sure it must cost more'' than that, even if construction began today, `` and the group of people who are going to suffer for this are the taxpayers _ and they're going to have to make up the difference.'' So acute is the district's need for prison space that about 500 inmates have been shipped, at a cost of $ 60 a day, to prisons in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Fifty inmates sent to the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, county jail were so disruptive that several had to be sent elsewhere and jail guards at one point threatened a strike unless security was tightened. Part of the problem of finding space for inmates, city officials say, is the district's burgeoning violent crime rate. Serious crime rose 19 percent in the first 11 months of 1988, compared to the same period in 1987, with homicides last year hitting a record 372. The homicide rate so far this year is running more than 50 percent ahead of last year's pace. But a lawyer for several <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> inmates disagrees. An increase in the prison population `` is something they should have anticipted many years ago,'' says <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliboe </PERSON>. `` I think that's just the weakest excuse.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you want to entice <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, dangle an exotic locale in front of him. That's what the Academy Award-winning actor said drew him to the television movie series `` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>,'' premiering tonight on `` The ABC Mystery Movie.'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> plays a brilliant anthropology professor who solves crimes that involve exotic cultures. <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> made the hit action film `` Iron Eagle'' in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the sci-fi drama `` Enemy Mine'' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and his new movie, `` The Punisher,'' was filmed in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Well, so the first two episodes of `` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'' were shot in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I'm from here, and the reception is very warm. Gets me through the cold winter day,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said during a break in shooting on location in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>. `` It's nice working with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> people. They're pretty real.'' Co-executive producer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> puts the cost per episode of `` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'' at about $ 3 million. Last month, the production moved to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for stories set in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. And if not for the writers' strike last summer that delayed the start of the season, <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said, the first episode would have been filmed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Maybe next season. And maybe <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, too. Wolf even hopes to shoot in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` That's exciting to me,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said. `` I've got some kids it would be wonderful to take with me, and it's an education that's just priceless. <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, 51, married soap opera star <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> in 1987. He has two sons, <PERSON> Satie </PERSON>, 14, from a previous marriage, and <PERSON> Sharron </PERSON>, 11, whose adoption just became final. <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, who grew up in the <LOCATION> Sheepshead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> _ `` I had to get a tongue transplant and a passport to get out of there,'' he laughed _ now lives in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I was n't happy until I saw the ocean again,'' he said. `` I felt quite stifled in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, because it's slow and plodding and you have to get in cars. Then I found <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. I went to a beach party, and I never left. It's that infinity. Something happens to you. What I needed was to be at the sea.'' `` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'' rotates with two other movie series, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s `` Columbo'' and `` B.L. <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'' comes from producers and writers whose credits include `` Hill Street Blues,'' `` Murder, She Wrote'' and `` Miami Vice.'' `` I said, now this is a challenge,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said. `` This is something I can do and not get bored with, with the repetition of. And they got the best of television to do it for me in -LRB- producers -RRB- <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackheim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. The best. If you ca n't do it with the best like that, I ca n't do it. As the crew set up across the street in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> stood around and entertained a cluster of fans. `` You the guy in ` Iron Eagle'?'' an eager youth asked. <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said yes. `` You really fly that plane?'' the young man asked. <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> allowed that no, he rode in the plane, but he did n't actually fly it. Though he's played Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, won his Oscar for a simmering portrayal of the drill sergeant in `` An Officer and a Gentleman,'' and is best-known on television for his role as Fiddler in `` Roots,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> has a huge following from his action movies. <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> is a karate expert who can take care of himself, but, said <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, `` if he gets hit, it's got to hurt, and if he hits somebody that's got to hurt his hand.'' `` What I'm trying to do is be careful with ` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>,' because it would be easy to do all action in these episodes,'' <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said. `` It leaves out his intelligence, his sense of humor, his caring, otherwise.'' `` The wonderful thing about the show is it is not easily categorized,'' said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. `` He's not a cop, he does n't carry a gun, he's not a private detective, he's not a coroner. He's a guy who understands subgroups because he's an anthropologist. `` As he says in the first show, he believes in the Socratic method, which is the acquisition of knowledge through the asking and answering of questions.'' The Nielsen ratings will answer the question of whether a not-easily categorized show can survive on network television, but <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> sees no end of possible stories. `` As long as there's man's inhumanity to man, as long as there's cultural deprivation, as long as there's conflict of some sort in this world _ and it does n't look like it's going to be over any time soon _ there's reason to have another episode,'' he said

<HEAD>Is The Quality of Service Improving?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the most cynical little intrusions into the quality of life today is the telephone solicitation at dinnertime from a bank promoting a credit card or a marketing firm conducting a survey. Most people would probably rank it as one of those nagging little mosquuito bites of life that must be endured, too small a matter to make an issue of, but certainly an irritant that their lives could do without. It is when the mosquitoes swarm that the minor peeves become unendurable, and no less an authority on the subject than `` The Quality Review'' has given recognition to the disturbing phenomenon. The review, published by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, usually concerns itself with momentous issues of product quality, especially as they relate to American competitiveness. In the past, for example, it has declaimed on such matters as <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s manufacturing problems, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s production efficiencies, and engineering and statistical strategies for maintaining high quality in goods production. Its descent into the more mundane world of pet peeves is provoked by the feeling that the mosquitoes are everywhere, and that all those little bites are leaving a welt on the quality of life equal to that of shoddy products. Judging from its list, the irritants are all the more irritating because as the country immerses itself deeper into the service economy _ as opposed to an economy of goods production _ it may be getting less service than ever before. First on its list is the unreturned telephone call. Making it especially frustrating is that the original call probably was received by a machine which, in its recorded voice, assured the caller that a response would be forthcoming. It may lead to telephone tag, with each party making successive fruitless attempts to return a call. The Review editors comment that `` this time-wasting endeavor is equivalent to rework in the manufacturing arena.'' Dinnertime sales or solicitation calls earned second place on the list, and provoked the suggestion that the way to deal with them is to screen your calls through an answering machine. Which, however, may be your friends' pet peeve. Hotel telephone operators who leave you holding the phone so long that you have to redial _ long-distance _ in order to leave a message, make the list. `` Indefinitely delayed'' notices at airports earn a place, along with the comment, `` If the airline ca n't bring itself to be upfront with the information that this flight may never leave the ground, maybe they could post the odds.'' Travelers who pre-empt overhead baggage compartments, sales clerks who turn their backs on customers to serve telephone customers instead, and servicemen or delivery men who keep you waiting all day are high on the Review's list. One of the more serious of its pet peeves _ one that seemingly could rank with some of the old-fashioned complaints that quality control people used to be concerned with _ is the service contract. Even customers who purchase these contracts think they are a bad idea, it says. It asks: `` Why should anyone need a five-year service contract on a water heater that is ` guaranteed' for 10 years?'' All pet peeve lists are likely to differ, especially if an attempt is made to limit them to a specific number. The Review, for example, feels that impenetrable packaging, ranging from cracker wrappings to appliance containers, and including envelopes that require tools to open, belong on many lists, if not theirs. But it suggests that the diversity of lists merely proves the point that there are so many of these little irritants swarming through our service society that they are serving to create a major problem.

<HEAD>Welcome to Washington, Murder Capital of the USA</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's the capital of the free world and the murder capital of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Just one night last week, three people were killed in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Typically, all were shootings and all, police said, could be drug-related. By Wednesday, 75 people had been killed this year in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, compared with 46 by the same time in 1988. Last year set a city record with 372 homicides _ virtually one a day and 145 more than in 1987. At the current rate, the city could log more than 600 murders this year. The pace of the killings in 1988 _ 59.4 for each 100,000 residents _ gave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a distinction it did n't want: Murder Capital <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, which held the title in 1987, had 58 murders per 100,000 residents. Why <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>? Police officers and experts agree: handguns and a sudden influx of cheap drugs. Both are easy to come by and both are increasingly finding their way into the hands of young Washingtonians, many of whom have become armed delivery people caught in wars between drug gangs. Ten of the 42 people killed in October were teen-agers. Seven more were in their early 20s. It was n't always so. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did n't become a target for the drug trade as early as other large cities did,'' said <PERSON> Gwynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Peirson </PERSON>, a retired criminology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who spent 23 years as a police officer in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It's a relatively recent phenomenon here because the population of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is n't the size of many other cities, so it was n't as attractive a market initially.'' That changed with the coming of crack, a highly potent and addictive _ but cheap to get hooked on _ form of cocaine that can be smoked. A typical dose of 100 milligrams, which a regular user might smoke a dozen or more times a day, sells on the street for about $ 10, said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. A 75-milligram `` starter'' dose often goes for $ 5. `` The average kid with an allowance can buy crack unimpeded,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` All he has to do is shake hands with his best buddy outside the school house.'' One expert said the very nature of crack has driven up the murder rate. `` There's something about the nature of crack that makes people crazy, makes them impulsive and likely to do irrational things,'' said <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a research organization. `` I've heard crack addicts say use of crack opens up every pleasure center in the body,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was a police officer for 24 years in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` The sensations are so high and also so short in terms of duration that almost after taking the first one, you need a second one because you're on a downer. So you have an ideal set of circumstances to create a huge market.'' Then there is the presence of guns. Ten to 20 years ago, high school students might have carried pen knives as protection. Today, said a city officer who requested anonymity, the protection is a handgun, often an automatic. `` We have people who are settling their arguments with guns,'' he said. Of the almost 1,600 weapons seized by police since late 1986 through Operation Clean Sweep, an undercover operation aimed at drug dealers, more than 1,200 have been handguns. To all that, add the high unemployment rate among the city's black teens In 1987, the last full year for which statistics are available, 22.4 percent had looked for legitimate work, but failed. `` It's an easy market with so many poor, unskilled black people willing to take the small risk,'' <PERSON> Peirson </PERSON> said. `` With people that are uneducated and unskilled, the idea of standing out on a street making $ 500 to $ 1,000 a night with the chances of getting caught relatively small, it's a small risk.'' Teen-agers and even younger children are being recruited to man the front lines on the drug battleground `` because the narco-traffickers know full well that we live in a society that treats children as children,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. `` They shield themselves by the children, who become targets of opportunity for other competitors. ... Most of the people being killed have barely begun to shave.'' Often these couriers work for one of the rival gangs of black Americans, Jamaicans, Nigerians and Latins battling for the same turf, said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. `` If there was something organized, maybe the -LRB- number of homicides -RRB- would be placated somewhat,'' he said. `` These are people who collect their bills one way or the other,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> added. `` They are very unforgiving for the slightest error or what seems to be betrayal. ... `` These people are presently jockeying for position, establishing areas of control, fighting for turf. They're very very violent. Get off my sand dune and stay off my sand dune.''

 What to do about the spiraling murder rate _ and the root problems of drugs and guns among the city's young _ has so far eluded officials. Operation Clean Sweep has resulted in close to 44,000 arrests, but one officer said, `` We're arresting the same people, over and over.'' Besides the arrests, officials say, the undercover effort has netted 458 seized vehicles, $ 2.15 million in cash and drugs with a street value of $ 16.7 million. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> cited budget problems when the program was reduced in November, but some police union officials say the effort has virtually ceased in the worst crime areas. <PERSON> Peirson </PERSON> contends merely arresting and sentencing street dealers wo n't do much good. `` They can do prison standing on their heads,'' he said, remembering a conversation with a prison warden in <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` She pointed out that 90 percent of them -LRB- the inmates -RRB- when they arrived had never seen a dentist, had never seen an eye doctor Now they had doctors, three meals a day, as much as they wanted. This is not the kind of punishment that's going to deter them.'' The mayor, himself involved in a federal investigation of his personal and professional life, said after last week's three-murder night that `` the only thing I can do is give people hope that I'm doing what I can -LRB- The people -RRB- want ideas. They want programs. They want action.'' Yet, his proposed budget would give the Police Department just 5 percent more in 1990. Rather than more money, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> thinks the department can do better with what it has. `` In the short run,'' said mayoral spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, `` he has asked the Police Department to study the way in which it has assigned its manpower so that more police officers will be on the street rather than inside on administrative duties. The mayor believes the size of the police force is sufficient, but there needs to be better allocation of resources than we have.'' Not everyone on the city council agrees with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s approach. `` People are outraged,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>. `` I'm telling him he does n't have it under control He ought to call for help.'' Winter would have President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declare a state of emergency and `` deploy every available resource,'' even the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, as part of the battle. For its part, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, through press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said last week that `` everyone in the country, including the president, is outraged by the homicides whether it be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or anywhere else.'' `` There are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind of problem,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The most obvious is for stepped-up law enforcement.'' Most of the drug-related shootings have been in the Southeast and Northeast quadrants of the city, where a majority of its poor, black residents live. But some have spilled over into largely affluent <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Less than 1 -LCB- miles from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, drug dealers peddle their wares along a corridor from 13th to 16th streets, NW. Diplomats at the Spanish Embassy on 15th Street, NW, are wary of their neighborhood. `` This area ... is well known for being a center strongly related to drugs and violence,'' said embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>. `` Consequently, the members of our embassy do not feel secure at all when entering or leaving the premises.'' So far, the violence has n't dissuaded tourists, who average about 19 million a year, from coming to town, said <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only people asking questions -LRB- about violence in the city -RRB- are reporters,'' <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Anti-Americanism: A Minority View Perhaps, But No Longer a Whisper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-American protesters are challenging <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s policies toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sparking more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism here than at any time in four decades. From student radicals yelling `` Yankee Go Home'' to farmers denouncing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture imports, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> are venting their frustration and anger at one of their oldest allies. When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> next Monday, he will find what one newspaper warns is a society `` quite different'' from the one he saw as vice president in April 1982. `` Do n't Come to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>!'' yell radical students, punctuating the words with raised, clenched fists. Criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is no longer relegated to private conversation. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags are torched and effigies of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are burned. Some 12,000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police with clubs and firebombs outside the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> this month and denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trying to force open <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s agricultural market Radical students staged a series of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities to demand an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence. They vowed to hold nationwide anti-government, anti-U.S. demonstrations to coincide with the president's visit. `` Arson, violence, destruction and lawlessness can not be tolerated,'' said President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> in demanding an end to protests. Every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president since the Korean War except <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> but none has come during a time of more public animosity against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policies. Businessmen, laborers, and students who have never thrown a firebomb are heard to complain that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is victimized by unfair trade pressures and rude, <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> arrogance. When asked their nationality by a Korean, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens rarely acknowledge that they are American. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing which labels them from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is no longer a sacred cow,'' said a western diplomat, requesting anonymity.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is no longer the patron saint of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has played roles in past dictatorial governments and we oppose the visit of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' claims a labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and human rights abuses of the past U.S.-supported authoritarian government. A few weeks ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it was considering closing its cultural center in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, because of repeated violent attacks and concern for the safety of its staff. <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> was the scene of a bloody nine-day civil uprising in 1980. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shared responsibility for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident by acquiescing in a military-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government plan to quell the uprising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied the charge. Although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact on relations and radicals have little public support, government leaders warn that growing anti-American sentiment could endanger <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s interests in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The government lost no time in apologizing publicly for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center attacks and appealed to radical students `` not to damage traditional Korea-U. friendship.'' The assistant foreign minister, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Suk-kyu </PERSON>, reflects the thinking of many when he says anti-Americanism `` is a minority view and a passing phenomenon, despite loud voices and anti-American activists.'' More than half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40 million people have been born since the Korean War ended 35 years ago, and long time observers link the intensity of anti-American feeling to the age of the participant. The younger the person, the more likely he or she is to feel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken its relationship with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for granted. The Korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist south and the communist north since the end of World War II in 1945. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fight the 1950-53 Korean War against the north and keeps 42,000 troops stationed in the south under a mutual defense pact. Radical students and dissidents feel the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stand in the way of unification talks with the north and have demanded the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. They also demand the halt to this year's joint <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> military exercises called `` Team Spirit.'' A more realistic relationship is needed between the two governments, say both protesters and some politicians, a relationship which recognizes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economic potential and place in global politics. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s leading trade partner. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sold <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> goods worth $ 8 billion more than it bought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Considerable pressure has been placed on the Koreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance the deficit. Anti-American comment became acceptable socially after last fall's Olympic Games when South Koreans of all ages had their frustration and resentment against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stoked by what they regarded as unruly behavior of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> athletes and biased coverage by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>.

 Here are brief sketches of some of the places that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit during his 5 -LCB- - day trip to three <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> capitals, beginning Wednesday
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TOKYO</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Okura Hotel</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend two nights in the hotel, most likely in the Imperial Suite used by then President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during the 1986 economic summit. The hilltop site of the 27-year-old hotel was owned by the noble <PERSON> Okura </PERSON> family, which had run one of the big pre-war industrial combines called zaibatsu. The 888-room hotel, across the street from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and ambassador's residence, just finished a three-year refurbishment last September. The management says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation is taking about 400 of the <PERSON> Okura </PERSON>'s rooms, and 13 other foreign delegations to the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> also will be housed there.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Akasaka Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The palace, where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> spent part of his young manhood and early married life before he ascended the throne in 1926, was completed in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence, and was such a grand building that the Meiji Emperor -LRB- 1868-1912 -RRB- was said to be unwilling to visit it. Modeled on the palace at <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Akasaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> is a grand example of architecture in the late Meiji period when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation, was trying to outdo the West. Most of the building materials and furnishings were imported. The palace, which sits in its own large park, was restored in the 1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and to hold major conferences, such as the 1986 economic summit. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will host a reception there following the <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> funeral.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Imperial Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The main ceremonial building within the moated, 284-acre palace grounds in the center of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the Imperial Palace was built in 1968 to replace a structure lost in a World War II firestorm caused by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing. The palace grounds include ponds, moats and forests as well as administrative buildings and the <LOCATION> Fukiage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> lived through his final illness. The moats, walls and some structures date from the 17th century, when the whole complex was called Edo Castle, the fortified headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokugawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shogunate </ORGANIZATION> that then ruled <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from Edo, the old name of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Shinjuku Imperial Gardens</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The site of the <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> funeral services, the park once served as the garden for the imperial household. In mid-April, it becomes one of the favorite places in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for people to picnic under what seem to be clouds of cherry blossoms. A sanctuary has been constructed for the funeral, as well as two tents 482 feet long to shelter 10,000 Japanese and foreign dignitaries from the February weather.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BEIJING</NOTE>
<NOTE>Great Hall</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 This cavernous, Soviet-style hall of beige-colored stone was built in less than a year for the celebration of the communist government's 10-year anniversary in 1959. It sits on the west side of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s broad Tienanmen Square in the traditional heart of the city, and is the site for all major gatherings, including <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conferences and legislative sessions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like other state visitors, will come here for his official red-carpet greeting, including cannon volleys and gifts of flowers from small children who jump up and down and shout in sing-song, `` Warm welcome.'' The president also will be toasted by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders at a Great Hall banquet. The central banquet hall, with a two-story-high ceiling, can sit 5,000 people and often does. But it is a long way from the basement kitchen, and food often arrives cold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Zhongnanhai</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Meaning `` the Central and South Seas,'' <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> is a 213-acre compound embracing two large lakes that used to be part of the imperial palace grounds. It now serves as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, and many visiting leaders, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, are taken behind its well-guarded vermillion walls to meet with party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. In the past, many top leaders also lived in <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, although the current leaders are believed to live most of the time in their own homes. A small portion of <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> is open to Chinese tourists as a park, but remains closed to foreigners.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Chongwenmen Christian Church</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to attend services at this Protestant church hidden behind high stone walls along a narrow hutong, or alley. The stone church built by missionaries with a round, dark-wood vaulted ceiling usually is filled to capacity on Sundays with about 1,500 people, making it one of the largest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s six Protestant churches. It was being used as a factory when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy. Like all other churches and temples, its religous functions were halted during the radical leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, when religion was banned. It reopened as a church in 1983. During the ban on religion, however, the pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqing </PERSON>, was ordered by the government to hold Sunday services for the small foreign community. The Bushes attended, and in 1975 Kan baptized their daughter, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, then 16.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Diaoyutai State Guesthouse</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese antiques, a king-sized bed, gold-plated plumbing and an electric massage chair are among the accommodations awaiting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in this elegant, high-security government hotel. <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>, `` the fishing terrace'' covering 100 acres of park, served as a retreat for emperors more than 800 years ago. The communist government built guest villas there in 1959 to accommodate the many foreign leaders visiting on the 10th anniversary of the communist takeover.

<NOTE>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Blue House</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The house and its auxiliary facilities have been used as the nation's presidential residence since the first Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was formed in 1948, and is now the home of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Built in 1927 by Japanese colonial rulers, the big two-story granite structure derives its name from its tiled roofs, which are painted blue. It is on a mountainside north of the city center, near the remaining royal palaces of the <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynasty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> kings </ORGANIZATION>, who ruled <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for five centuries. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military administration used the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as its headquarters for three years after <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided in 1945.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The National Assembly</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The National Assembly building, home of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s unicameral legislative body, is a domed six-story structure surrounded by granite columns said to symbolize the harmony of diverse opinions of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people. The assembly building was constructed in 1975 on an island in the <LOCATION> Han </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which runs through the capital city. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> during his visit in April 1982 as vice president.

<TEXT>
 Chinese artists and intellectuals are pushing back state-set limits on creativity and expression, setting off the widest debate on politics, art and culture in a decade. From a television program on the collapse of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s culture to an exhibition of avant-garde art to poetry readings in dingy dancehalls, intellectuals in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are diving through a small window of opportunity to call for political, social and economic change. `` None of us knows how long this will last,'' said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>, a self-described `` free'' artist. `` But it's a good time to be creating.'' Criticism of the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, long relegated to the privacy of one's home, has become more open. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in crisis _ political, economic and cultural,'' said <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON>, a leading Marxist theorist, during a talk at one of several study groups that have opened recently. `` We need to democratize this society to allow the people to supervise the party and the government.'' Many say the government is too preoccupied with its economic troubles to worry about the current foment in intellectual life. Inflation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has hit its highest level since the Communist took power in 1949, reaching an official rate of almost 20 percent. Economists say it is actually twice as high. Corruption is widespread and the state-run press has recently acknowledged increases in prostitution, strikes and drug smuggling. `` With all this chaos, the higher-ups do n't really have time to watch over us bookworms,'' said <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawei </PERSON>, an art critic at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. `` As long as we do n't ask for money, they do n't ask too many questions.'' Others say the authorities may not take the intellectuals' activities seriously or may believe they have n't become widespread enough to justify a crackdown Indeed, so far, only a small, but vocal, fraction of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s intellectuals are taking part. A minority views the relaxation as a ploy by conservatives to create more chaos in society and provide an excuse for new repression. But this perspective is not popular. `` It does n't take into account that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people have changed,'' said <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanru </PERSON>, a philosopher also at the fine arts academy. `` The people are n't listening to the government anymore. If it yells again, nobody will follow.'' It also does n't take into account the spontaneity of the change. Previous thaws were ordered or supported from above. The Hundred Flowers Movement of 1956 in which intellectuals were encouraged to criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was apparently masterminded by Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> to identify heretical thinkers. Many of those who spoke out during the brief thaw were purged from the party and arrested. The most recent period of relative intellectual freedom _ the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> movement of 1978 which called for political freedoms _ was allowed by Chinese leaders, including the newly emerged top leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, in an attempt to justify their plan for widespread political and economic reform. When the movement outlasted its utility its leaders were jailed. An early sign of the newest thaw came last summer when the six-part series `` River Die Young'' ran on national television twice to an audience of hundreds of millions. As it discussed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fascination with dragons, `` River Die Young'' criticized the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people's willingness to bow to authority. As it described the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which has changed its course many times in the past, killing millions of people, the program questioned Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s turbulent history. `` Watching ` River Die Young,' we discovered that what our teachers taught us was false,'' wrote one high-school viewer to screen writer <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaokang </PERSON>. `` You showed us <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s weaknesses.'' Another sign came in November in the small but well-respected journal `` Economic Research.'' Three economists from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> called for the abandonment of public ownership, the bedrock of the socialist system, and the institution of a private property system. `` Our goal is to liberate the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' said one of the theorists, <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheng </PERSON>. `` Social justice, the right of self-realization, is the essence of socialism, and that has nothing to do with state control.'' Neither has politics been immune. On Jan. 28, a group of political theorists gathered in the basement of a private bookstore to discuss a new periodical, `` New Enlightenment.'' In its first two editions, the booklet advocates political transformation. `` The time has come for intellectuals to form a pressure group to force the government to change,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident, told the meeting. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> has called for multiparty democracy and greater respect for human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Literature, especially poetry, has also blossomed in the form of small reading groups where authors and poets gather to share their works. One such meeting was held Jan. 29 in a run-down dancehall in eastern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. About 30 members of the group, `` Silent Night,'' gathered for an afternoon of poetry, discussion and music. `` Writing in this society is very lonely work,'' said one poet at the meeting. `` We meet like this to cut the pain.'' But like the current political debate, these poetry readings have yet to reach the ordinary man. Art, however, has. In December, the first exhibition of nude paintings, banned for decades under the puritanical policies of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION>, opened in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. About 200,000 people saw it. On Feb. 5, artists defied a ban on performance art during the first exhbition of avant-garde art at the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery, the nation's main museum. One artist fired two BBs into her sculpture _ a telephone booth. Another sold shrimp to protest `` the commercialization of art.'' Authorities closed the show for five days and allowed it to re-open on the condition that the artists would respect the ban. But despite the restrictions, many artists said things had changed for the better. `` In the past, we would n't have challenged the ban,'' said one of the `` performers.'' `` And once they closed the show, they would have closed it for good. Now we're pushing them.'' The new thaw raises questions for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rulers as artists and intellectuals continue to stretch the boundaries of what is permissible. Will the rulers continue to ignore the change and concentrate on the economy? Or is another crackdown coming? `` We are living in a contradiction,'' said one writer. `` As patriots we want the economy to be strong, but as intellectuals its weakness allows us to create.''

<TEXT>
 Trucks and barges pile 52 million pounds of paper, cans, plastic and other trash daily onto a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> dump, building the world's biggest mountain of garbage toward a height rivaling the skyscrapers across the bay in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Much of that could be recycled, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials have begun considering a plan to do so. Elsewhere, more and more communities are already recycling the trash their citizens throw out. They have little choice. While the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dump is planned to operate 11 more years, a third of the nation's 6,000 garbage dumps are expected to shut within five years, forcing communities to find new ways to dispose of their garbage. Every American man, woman and child generates 3.5 pounds of refuse a day _ adding 160 million tons to the nation's trash pile each year. That pile holds 42 percent paper, 23 percent food and yard waste, 9.4 percent glass, 9.2 percent metals, 6.5 percent plastics, and 9.4 percent other materials, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Ten states already require _ or soon will require _ residents to separate newspapers, glass jars, milk cartons, tin cans or other discarded items for recycling trucks or bins. Legislators in 33 states are expected to consider plans to increase recycling this year. `` People do n't want incinerators or dumps near them, so they are beginning to force their elected officials to start recycling programs,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, a senior researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization that studies environmental issues. Recycling is not new in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. During World War II, `` everybody recycled,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Commoner </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for the Biology of Natural Systems. `` People even recycled rubber bands and string.'' But the efforts to conserve mostly ended with the war. Now only 10 percent of the nation's garbage is recycled, compared to as much as 60 percent by some cities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be recycled, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has set a goal of recycling 25 percent in four years. The process of recycling is simple: separating usable products from the trash; processing them so they can be substituted for more expensive raw materials at manufacturing plants; and returning them to the marketplace as parts of new products. It has not been so easy to put into effect. Some communities have had trouble finding buyers for discarded newspapers, glass or plastic; recycling programs require start-up funds; and, perhaps most importantly, people's habits of throwing trash into only one can be difficult to change. Still, experts predict recycling will eventually become a part of the everyday infrastructure of cities and towns. `` Today, trash trucks dominate waste hauling,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grogan </PERSON>, director of material recovery for R.W. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which has helped dozens of communities start recycling programs. `` But by the year 2010, we're going to see as many recycling trucks as dump trucks, recycling centers as common as video shops ... and recycling introduced in lesson plans in schools across the country.'' Among the communities now making it easier for residents to recycle trash, several are considered international models: _ <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb, started a program in 1981 and now claims 98 percent of its 3,350 households participate `` Unless they want to eat their garbage, they better separate it or we wo n't pick it up,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kankolenski </PERSON>, a public works department employee She said 34 percent of the trash is recycled and nearly all the rest burned. _ <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> residents already recycled 24 percent of their garbage before the city started its program last year and the city is aiming for 60 percent in 10 years Even steel garbage cans are being recycled. _ <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, officials say a voluntary six-town program in southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> has 70 percent participation Started a decade ago, the program recycles 42 percent of the garbage brought to a center, burns 47 percent and buries 11 percent. Even more is possible. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s recycling director, feeds her food scraps to worms. `` They eat everything up,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said of the little red worms that are covered with peat moss in a basement box lined with plastic and newspapers. The worms' digestive system allows them to eat the food quickly and so far it has n't attracted cockroaches or mice. `` I've been very surprised at how well it works,'' she said. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, named Recycler of the Year in 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, does n't stop there. She recycles all her household waste except for some types of plastics, junk mail on high-grade paper and light bulbs. In a month, she throws out only two small bags. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Steyh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s administrator of garbage and recycling contracts, also goes to great lengths to recycle his trash. He lives on an island in Puget Sound, where he can recycle only tin cans. So, on his ferry rides to work he takes newspapers, glass, aluminum cans and other items. `` I bring them to my in-laws and they recycle it with their things,'' <PERSON> Steyh </PERSON> said. Solid waste management companies also are expanding into recycling, creating more markets for recycled materials. `` Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon,'' said <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, recycling director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 2,500 companies that handle half of the nation's household waste and 95 percent of its industrial waste. She said the industry approached recycling warily. `` They had a routine, a routine without a lot of regulations. Then all these -LRB- state -RRB- laws came,'' she said. `` What happened was that haulers nationwide were losing business to recycling.'' Now, industry seminars on the topic are full, she said. The recycling movement also has put in jeopardy some proposed trash-to-energy incinerators. Planned incinerators have been shelved in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Incinerators have been touted as a way to produce energy and reduce the amount of garbage, but questions persist about the affect on air quality and on the disposal of the byproduct of ash laced with toxins. In 1983, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> proposed what would be the world's largest trash-to-energy incineration system. The project, which still needs federal and state permits, faces stiff opposition from environmentalists and neighborhood groups. Environmentalists say the solution to the city's garbage crisis should be aggressive recycling. Their goals are 60 percent in 10 years, 90 percent in 20 years. Currently, the city recycles less than 1 percent of its trash. However, under legislation proposed earlier this month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, mandatory recycling would be phased in over five years. `` The debate has now changed from, ` What are we going to do about the garbage crisis?' to ` How much can we recycle?''' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonioli </PERSON>, a staff member with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Earth is not a dump.''

<HEAD>What to Do with 240 Million Thrown Away Tires</HEAD>

 Mountains of scrap tires are being eroded by entrepreneurs who are cutting them up for fuel, mixing them with asphalt to extend highway life and using them to soften airport runways. The pioneers are seeking profitable ways to recycle discarded tires and remove a huge trash problem. An estimated 240 million tires are added to the highly flammable heaps each year. Some tires are recycled the old-fashioned way, by retreading, but only 20 percent are suited for that use. A few get new life as buffers for marine and truck loading docks. Some end up in the backyard as tire swings. But most tires just piled up until business people and scientists recently stepped up efforts to find new uses. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, for instance, a company is experimenting with chopped up tires as a fuel additive in coal-fired boilers to see if they can reduce acid rain, and scrap tires are being used as components in septic tank systems. For some, finding new uses for scrap tires `` is like -LRB- hauling -RRB- garbage _ you get paid to take it in and get paid to make it into a fuel,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. His company uses scrap tires as a supplemental fuel at three wood-processing plants `` We compete against oil in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, against gas in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and, in the Southeast, we're competing against coal,'' <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON> said. Waste Recovery spent $ 2 million apiece on plants in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, each capable of burning 5 million tires a year, but the company is not making money yet, <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, former research director of <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION>, a tiremaker that is now part of <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, spent much of his career trying to build a better tire and now is working to retire the mountains of leftovers. `` It's very clear to me that a scrap tire can very well pay for its self-disposal,'' he contends. <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, a consultant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said much of his current research is confidential because he intends to seek patents. But he said one new use is adding chopped bits of tires to speed up the composting of sewage sludge. `` It's gathering a fair amount of momentum,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said, citing community programs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshipe </LOCATION> and research at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. If each of the 250 sludge composting sites in the nation used scrap tire chips instead of traditional wood chips to promote the process, a three-year supply of scrap tires would be needed, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. Another trend people in the business foresee is increasing state and city regulation of scrap tire disposal. <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON> said disposal costs range from 25 to 50 cents a tire depending on licensing and transportation costs. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, for instance, began a 50-cent surcharge on each new tire sale this year to finance disposal. The surcharge will double to $ 1 in 1990.

 Only days after arriving from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, 9-year-old <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocharian </PERSON> stood behind the grocery store cash register, his bandaged right hand, maimed in an earthquake, tucked in his jacket pocket. With his good hand he tried to help make change in unfamiliar dollars and cents. The boy, waiting to be treated for injuries he suffered when the quake last December shook down the walls of his school, smiled at everyone who entered <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annadid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohanian </PERSON>'s store. The couple, immigrants from the Soviet Unit the newspaper quoted one source as saying the report ould contain `` a wealth of allegations about the guy's personal conduct.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who wrote the report, told the newspaper the report will contain new information on Tower that has not been made public. Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and philandering. Many senators also have voiced concern about whether Tower could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than $ 1 million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, whose committee is reviewing the nomination, has said that an investigation of Tower's actions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> found no security breaches. He also said Wednesday that if members of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bring up questions about Tower's personal life the lawmakers may be forced to meet behind closed doors. `` I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor by senators who are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deliberations should the nomination clear his panel. `` I emphasize that the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will make this decision, not the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or its chairman,'' he said.

 This ramshackle jungle settlement has become a boom town in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s illicit cocaine trade, luring thousands from city shantytown or impoverished countryside with a promise of quick fortune from the coca leaf. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendieta </PERSON> came out of poverty in the village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libertad </LOCATION> three years ago, planted coca for awhile and now owns an electronics store. Ten-year-old <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> by his mother to shine shoes after his father died and now he earns enough money to live on and send home. `` How am I going to deny I cultivate coca if it's growing all around here as far as the eye can see,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttgenbach </PERSON>, a Peruvian of German descent who lost his job as a laborer when the lumber company he worked for went bankrupt. `` Coca is paying for my six children to study in good schools in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Without coca my family would go hungry.'' Landless peasants, the jobless from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, highland merchants, Colombian drug dealers _ all have streamed into <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>, swelling its population from 10,000 in 1981 to 25,000 today. `` When I was working four years ago in a poor neighborhood in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, you heard the name <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>. Kids were coming out here then to build airstrips for the drug traffickers,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>, a Canadian priest who now works in <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION>, 55 miles south of here. Operation Thunderbolt, a major police drive against cocaine trafficking in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> in late 1987, put a dent in the narcotics trade in <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>. It forced the town's cocaine boss, a gang leader known as `` The Vampire,'' to flee into the jungle and dried up the flow of drug dollars. Sales in shops fell to half their normal level. But the 250-man police force that seized control of <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> from an alliance of leftist guerrillas and cocaine smugglers has dwindled to about 50 troopers today, and the town is regaining its gold-rush atmosphere. New three - and four-story homes jut up against a backdrop of jungled hills Shops along <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>'s unpaved, muddy streets are filled with color television sets, stereo systems and luxury items like gold-plated lighters. The town's allure is reflected in a popular rock song, `` Going to <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION>,'' which led <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s top 10 musical hits for three months in 1988. Tocache's fame is such that Peruvians have coined a word, `` tocachization,'' to describe the explosive violence, corruption and wild, lopsided prosperity of other jungle villages following in its steps. Tocache once again is receiving a steady flow of `` narco-dollars'' from Colombian drug buyers who arrive in small planes at clandestine runways in the jungle. The Colombians pick up shipments of `` coca paste'' _ semi-refined cocaine made from the leaves of coca bushes that cover mile after mile of hillsides in the area. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> the paste is refined into pure cocaine powder, which is smuggled to the lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European markets. The dollars to pay Peruvian coca farmers end up being trucked over the Andes to a network of streetside money changers in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s capital on the coast 300 miles to the southwest. Economists estimate the cocaine trade pumps as much as $ 1.2 billion a year into <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s faltering economy, a sum equal to half the country's earnings from legal exports. The appeal of `` narco-dollars'' has made <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> and neighboring settlements a promised land for some 200,000 peasants who have migrated to the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> valley in the last two decades to grow coca, a crop that pays 10 times as much as any other. It is illegal to grow coca in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> without the permission of the state coca company <ORGANIZATION> Enaco </ORGANIZATION>, which markets the leaves to drug companies or distributes them for such uses as chewing and making tea. <PERSON> Enaco </PERSON> says all of the coca in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, where the vast majority of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s coca leaf is cultivated, is illegal, but <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> lacks the manpower, equipment and resources to stop it. The prosperity around <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> is apparent even to the casual observer. The jungle trails outside town pass house after house with television antennas, refrigerators and gasoline generators for power. Often motorcycles and four-wheel drive vehicles are parked outside. Such acquisitions are luxuries in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where most peasants consider themselves fortunate to have a solid meal a day. Farmers are not the only ones to benefit from the coca bonanza. `` Everyone in this town, from the bigshot coca dealer to the streetcorner ice cream vendor, lives off drug trafficking, either directly or indirectly,'' says a police commander, speaking on condition he not be identified by name. The sudden riches obtained by immigrants are resented by the small number of townspeople who have not joined in the cocaine trade.

 School Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> says bitterly the town's teachers have become steadily poorer, while uneducated peasants from the Andes have grown wealthy overnight `` They arrived poor and have become rich while we, the teachers, the ones with education, are poorer than ever,'' <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> says. `` The only ones who have failed to progress are those who have not participated in this illicit business.'' Police say most of Tocache's residents, including prosperous merchants and bar keepers, continue cultivating coca outside of town even after they make enough money to open legitimate businesses. Townspeople are suspicious of outsiders and most refuse to acknowledge their direct involvement in the illegal, often deadly enterprise of cocaine trafficking. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendieta </PERSON>, 30, the owner of the electronics store, says he stopped growing coca since opening his business. `` I planted a little coca and after two years I had enough money to open this store,'' he said. `` Business has gone well. I have no complaints.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, the shoeshing boy, was in <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> 12 hours after his mother put him on a bus in the mountain town of <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION> and not long after that he was earning five dollars a day _ three times the national minimum wage. `` I send money home to my mother each week so my brothers and sisters can eat,'' he says proudly. Tocache's growth was made possible by the <LOCATION> Jungle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, a visionary project launched 25 years ago during the administration of President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> to spur colonization of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s virtually uninhabited tropical forests The highway, running 1,000 miles north to south, hugs the lower eastern slopes of the Andes. `` The coca boom began when the jungle was opened up,'' says <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and an expert on coca. `` That was when the migration of landless campesinos began. They were the pioneers of the jungle and the first thing they did was plant coca as the most profitable crop available.'' <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 33, manager of a small restaurant and one of the few born here, recalls that when he was a boy, <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> was a sleepy village of several hundred farmers. `` People used coca to chew. They knew nothing about cocaine,'' he says, referring to the centuries-old Andean tradition of chewing coca leaves to dampen hunger and increase energy. Things began to change when drug-trafficking gangs, under pressure from police, moved their base of operations to <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, the valley's biggest town, 80 miles south of here. `` Since 1984 drug traffickers have been considered the upper crust of <LOCATION> Tocache </LOCATION> society,'' School Superintendnent <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> says with an ironic chuckle. `` Moral values have been turned upside down. Young people have lost all interest in studying. They want money, and the quickest way to get money is to plant coca.'' The biggest drug trafficker of all was `` The Vampire.'' He is believed to still be in the area although he has not returned to town. People say his name was fitting: He lived in a sprawling, garishly decorated home with a blood-red ceiling and similarly colored furniture. When he saw an attractive woman on the street, he took her and if her companion was foolish enough to protest, he killed him. The Vampire's favorite killing spot was the bridge over the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Backed up by his henchmen, he would take his victims there, drive a knife into their chests or shoot them through the head and dump their bodies into the swift-flowing river, townspeople say. `` I knew The Vampire,'' says <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, the shoeshine boy. `` He lived in the ` casa grande.' I shined his shoes. He gave me big tips and joked with me. But when he was in a bad mood, he was mean.''

 When <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Muelas </PERSON> leaves the construction site in the winter twilight, he walks to his car through narrow alleys where Christians, Moslems and Jews once rubbed shoulders. Then he drives four centuries back home to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The 45-year-old architect is working in the vast 16th-century <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martyr </LOCATION> convent complex, drawing up and executing plans to turn it into a modern government administrative center. `` Some days when I leave I feel like I'm emerging from the 15th or 16th centuries, I do n't know where I am,'' <PERSON> Muelas </PERSON> says, surveying one of three cloistered patios that form the core of the former <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> convent that expanded to about the size of a soccer field through the heart of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> order grew in power. The transformation of the convent, which has also served as an army barracks, stables, home for the elderly and orphanage, is the largest project yet undertaken in the preservation and restoration of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, a once strategic city on a hill whose origins go back to the Roman colony of <LOCATION> Hispania </LOCATION>. Like <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fez </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> has been declared part of the world's cultural patrimony by <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization. And as in the case of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> needs more than declarations to help it remain a living city as well as a monumental symbol of a time when three of the world's major religious cultures thrived together on a rocky outcropping of the La Mancha plain. <PERSON> Rose-Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>, calls <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> `` one of the places where three cultures lived successfully,'' comparing the city's former mix to that of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in their finer days. Mrs. <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> is the only non-Spanish member of the Board of Directors of the year-old <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to mobilize the interest, government support and independent financial backing necessary to save the city. She hopes to set up a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch when she returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when her husband leaves his post in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> this year. The group has just moved into its headquarters in a room at one end of the medieval <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> bridge renovated by <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> youths employed at a restoration workshop school set up by the regional government of <LOCATION> Castille-La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mancha </LOCATION>. Convents like <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martyr </LOCATION> are a key element in the future of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. There are some 50 within the old, walled portion of the city. Most were built to house at least 400 cloistered nuns each but now have less than 20 inhabitants, most of whom are over 65.

The rehabilitation of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martyr </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Muelas </PERSON> says the Dominicans meant it originally as an administrative center for some aspects of the Spanish Inquisition when they opened it in 1540 _ is budgeted at $ 10 million.

The center has served as the setting for several tri-cultural congresses. Roman Catholics and Jews lived under Moslem rule when the Moors incorporated <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirate </LOCATION> in 711 before it became the capital of an independent Moorish kingdom in 1012. The city was reconquered by a Christian king in 1085 and reached its glory under the 1252-1284 reign of <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, the Wise. At the height of his rule, <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> became the most important Jewish center in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, a country known in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> as Sepharad, from which Sephardic Jews get their name. Moorish artisans using brick construction, carved wood, sculpted plaster and painted tiles built the Transito and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> synagogues. Then, in 1492 Queen <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>, in an effort to consolidate her position on the <LOCATION> Iberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, signed an edict banishing all Moslems and Jews from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. As part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary in 1992 of the first voyage of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government has declared <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> the headquarters of Sepharad 92 and a symbol of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s `` re-encounter'' with its Jewish heritage. When <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, visited <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> a year ago, Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> told him the old city needed $ 100 million over the next two decades to reverse a depopulation trend that threatened to turn the city into a ghost town filled with monuments and tourist shops. Of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>'s 60,000 inhabitants, about 16,000 live inside the city's Moorish walls where streets are only as wide as a person's outstretched arms, parking is impossible and `` everyone knows what you're doing,'' in the words of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, an Englishman married to a Spaniard who lived in the old city for six years On evenings and weekends the main Zocodover Plaza fills with people who come to gossip, drink a beer, or buy almond paste marzipan, a Moorish-Jewish legacy and a <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> speciality. Many of the dwellings in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> have been abandoned over the years by squabbling heirs who do n't want to live 42 miles from much more up-to-date <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. Many are either palaces or hovels, too big or too small for single families. Former Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON>, a member of the foundation's board of directors, is looking for a way to use state-of-the-art technology to make a medieval city liveable <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> is working with representatives of the city's major industries _ <ORGANIZATION> Alcatel </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nixdorf </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Beecham </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> pharmaceutical firms _ to solve mundane but pressing problems of what to do with the elecrical and telephone lines that dangle in clusters and crisscross narrow streets and the television antennae that sprout from red-tile roofs. The Spanish government through the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION>'s restoration department has earmarked 81.6 million pesetas -LRB- $ 710,000 -RRB- in 1989 for work on <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>'s magnificent 13th century cathedral, the Tornerias mosque, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> convent A similar sum was budgeted last year. The ministry's museums department spent an additional 33.3 million pesetas -LRB- $ 290,000 -RRB- restoring the house of the painter <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>, the Transito and the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> museum. The regional government spent 70.1 million pesetas -LRB- $ 609,000 -RRB-. These amounts, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> says, are but a drop in the bucket. The foundation is in the process of drawing up the first overall plan to present to the Ministry of Culture on what has to be done to establish what Mrs. <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> calls `` the very fine balance between a museum city and a city that lives.'' Spanish government support for the plan is essential in encouraging fund-raising from other sources, she adds. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> says the lack of a specific plan has hindered fund-raising from sources outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish groups that could be interested in the restoration of the city's old Jewish quarter.

 Housing construction posted its biggest gain in nearly a year during January, the government reported, but analysts said the surge was due more to unusually mild weather than an upturn in the market.

<HEAD>Some Texas Thrifts Are Offering Extra-High Rates To Attract Deposits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although the `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> premium'' is not as big as it used to be, some of the state's smaller, weaker thrifts are chasing after depositors with rates so high that federal regulators have become concerned. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts account for 11 of the top 25 yields available on six-month jumbo certificates of deposit, according to 100 Highest Yields, a publication in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Ten of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> 11 are rated financially weak or insolvent, making them least able to afford the high rates they pay depositors. Their actions could add to the cost to taxpayers of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposed $ 90 billion bailout, the government says. `` Paying a premium rate has an effect on the total cost to the government in resolving these insolvencies and, in the meantime, others in the region have to compete with these insolvent institutions,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Thursday. The `` jumbo'' certificates of deposit are sold in units of $ 100,000, meaning the buyers tend to be institutions or wealthy individuals who are on the lookout for high yields backed up by federal insurance. `` A few weak -LRB- thrift -RRB- institutions still continue to play the hot-money game,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heady </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>, a publication affiliated with 100 Highest Yields. Aside from the relatively small number of high payers, rates on deposits at big <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts are today only slightly above the national average, a change from the days when the state's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls had to pay a big `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> premium'' to attract deposits. Most of the highest rates on regular deposits are now offered in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, where there is strong loan demand because of the healthier economy. `` The fact is that, in light of the president's statements and other statements by the administration, there is no excess level of risk in placing deposits in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions,'' <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's $ 90 billion proposal to rescue troubled thrifts, many of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was intended partially to close those institutions that were driving up deposit rates for the rest of the industry. But two insolvent Houston-area thrifts this week jacked up interest rates as high as 10.75 percent for six-month jumbo CDs. The spike in rates, which already is subsiding, was described by officials of high-bidding <ORGANIZATION> BancPlus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> as a temporary, cyclical cash drive for mortgage operations. `` One of the primary objectives of the government is to stabilize the situation, and it certainly does n't lend stability when there are rates out there of such size,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdetero </PERSON>, executive vice president at Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no way you can buy that kind of money and turn it out and make any profit on it.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> tried to keep up with the increasing rates for CDs, which were limited to deposits of $ 95,000 - $ 100,000 The thrift raised its six-month rate from 9.8 percent to 10.1 percent Monday before dropping back the next day to 9.875 percent. <PERSON> Valdetero </PERSON> said the thrift retreated on its own from the rate battle, but <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is under <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction and that the agency stepped in to reduce the rates. <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, boosted its rates to 10.75 percent from about 9.3 percent. BancPlus was close behind at 10.65 percent, but lowered its rate on the six-month deposits to 10.60 percent Thursday and expected to drop still lower by Friday, spokesman <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said. Commonwealth paid the highest rate in the nation for six-month jumbo CDs as of Wednesday, at 10.75 percent, according to 100 Highest Yields. The rest of the top five were <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, 9.85 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, 9.80 percent; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, 9.80 percent; and <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corinth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, 9.80 percent. The list is for institutions of all sizes. As for the bigger thrifts, statistics from the 10 largest thrifts in each of the 10 major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities showed <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> had an average 9.11 percent rate on jumbo CDs and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> averaged 9.10 percent, compared to the national average of 8.97 percent. Rates in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were even higher, at 9.26 percent. Presumably the demand for loans is high enough in those cities that their thrifts need to offer high rates to attract deposits that they can then re-lend, <PERSON> Heady </PERSON> said. Reflecting the regional shift, a year ago, 75 of the nation's 100 top yields on regular, small-denomination CDs and money market accounts were offered by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions. Only 10 to 12 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions remain on that list, while about 66 are from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states, <PERSON> Heady </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is disputing criticism that his $ 1.16 trillion budget allows him to take credit for proposing expanded social spending while sticking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with finding ways to pay for it. `` It's a two-way street,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he vowed to make good on his commitment to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on spending cuts. The president, who made the remarks on Thursday in an Oval Office interview with a group of reporters, was to give yet another out-of-town speech today promoting that fiscal 1990 spending plan. His talk at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> was his third speech on the budget since he unveiled it a week ago before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made similar remarks to business leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Monday and to state legislators in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Today's address also was expected to stress volunteerism in the private sector _ one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pet themes. Democratic critics have called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget vague on where he would make between $ 9.6 billion and $ 11 billion in cuts to carry out his commitments for new spending on domestic programs like education, child care, the homeless and cleaning up the environment. `` I said ahead of time I did n't expect everybody would jump up and down and say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on Thursday. But he rejected the notion that he had been deliberately vague in the budget to put the onus on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> alone for coming up with unpopular spending cuts. `` Yes, there's a lot more detail that has to be hammered out. And we will work with them to satisfy their interests, and find out what they want. It's a two way street,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said he was generally pleased with the reaction so far toward both his budget plan and to his program to rescue the nation's ailing savings and loans _ even though he conceded that the twin plans were n't universally popular <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also denied anew any major policy rift with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, even though they hold different views on inflation and interest rates. `` It's one of the best fights in town,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of battles between a president and a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief. `` You all love it, all politicians love it, bankers like it, all editorialists for the Wall Street Journal love it. But I want to avoid that because we are n't far apart. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been nudging up short-term rates in recent months in an effort to minimize inflation risks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday: `` I do n't see the inflationary pressures as so bad, or enough, to warrant substantially higher interest rates.'' Higher interest rates could the dampen economic growth that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is counting on to produce government revenue gains assumed in his budget.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate surged to 7.5 percent in January from 6.8 percent in the previous month, pushed to its highest level in more than six years by higher mortgage rates, the government said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> said its retail price index rose 0.6 percent in January from the previous month. The index, which uses a 1987 base of 100, stood at 111 in January, crease of 7.3 percent to 7.5 percent. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> warned last Saturday that the rise was likely to be much above the 6.8 percent increase recorded for December. The 7.5 percent inflation rate is the highest since mid-1982. Share prices retreated on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on the news, and the pound rose a bit. Trading in the markets was quiet. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 14.4 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,019.4 after the report was released. The index was 12.5 points lower before. The pound was quoted at $ 1.7785 vs. $ 1.7780 earlier. `` These figures do show very strong inflationary pressures,'' said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> and Co. The department said the rise was mainly due to higher mortgage interest payments, reflecting mortgage rate hikes made in January following the late-November rise in the British commercial banks' base rate to 13 percent from 12 percent Excluding mortgage payments, the department said the annual inflation rate was 5.5 percent. The government remains determined to bring inflation down, but one consequence of using the higher interest rates as its weapon is higher inflation in the short-term, the department said. The January increase also reflected higher food prices, motor insurance premiums and rail fares, it said.

<HEAD>Fruehauf Says Loss Widened Due To 1986 Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Debt and expenses from a 1986 leveraged buyout by management of <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> caused increased losses in the fourth quarter and for 1988, the truck-trailer and auto parts maker says. Fruehauf on Thursday reported a net loss of $ 10.2 million, or $ 1.39 a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a net loss of $ 6.1 million, or 84 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987. The losses came despite improved revenue, $ 557.0 million for the quarter, up from $ 461.9 million for the year-earlier period, the company said in a news release. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> said it had a net loss of $ 56.5 million, or $ 6.50 a share, on revenue of $ 2.09 billion, compared with a net loss of $ 41.5 million, or $ 5.97 a share, on revenue of $ 1.96 billion in 1987. The company said it had long-term debt of $ 710 million on Dec. 31, though that was down from $ 794 million on Dec. 31, 1987, and interest expenses of $ 101 million for 1988, reduced from $ 109 million the year before. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of the buyout amounted to $ 113.5 million in 1988, down from $ 118.9 million in 1987, the company said. Its <ORGANIZATION> Kelsey-Hayes </ORGANIZATION> operation provided the only revenue increase for the company. <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> said revenue from automotive operations _ its <ORGANIZATION> Kelsey-Hayes </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary's antilock braking systems and aluminum wheels _ grew 21.5 percent, partly offset by costs of a new plant and equipment. But the company said rising materials costs contributed to a 6.2 percent decline in trailer manufacturing revenue and a 19.4 percent decline in revenue from its ship-repair facility in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Importer Disputes Domestic Producers' Steel Supply Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite claims by domestic producers of excess steel production capacity worldwide, a leading importer says there are shortages that justify a second look at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel trade quotas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers, demanding another five years of quotas, cite excess world capacity of 100 million tons or more per year of steel as the basis for cutthroat trading practices. `` I assure you most steel is imported into this market because it fills specific needs of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> steel users,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a director and immediate past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. `` That may help dispel the notion most steel brought into this country is foisted on American buyers by means of unfair trade practices.'' References to foreign production overcapacity as a cause of problems for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry may concern obsolete plants and marginal product categories, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery Thursday night in <LOCATION> Hasbrouck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to the Association of Women in the Metals Industries. `` Though global surplus is widely discussed, we have all encountered specific product shortages in the past year,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who is also vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Steelinter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a major importer of Belgian steel. The shortages involve plate, large structural shapes and rod, he said. The New York-based importers association says the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should ease the steel import restrictions under the five-year quota plan due to expire in September. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised American producers to extend the protection. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers say another five years of quotas are necessary if they are to fully recover from a near disasterous slump in their industry from 1982-86. They accuse foreign steel producers, especially those in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, of producing excess steel with government subsidies to maintain employment in their countries. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said that since the early 1970s domestic steel buyers had been forced to turn to foreign suppliers not only for particular types of steel but also because total domestic steelmaking capacity repeatedly had fallen short of demand. The shortfall was more than 20 million tons in 1988, and `` the problem was especially acute in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, where domestic production facilities were insufficient,'' he said. Importers have asked that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> make any further quotas temporary with a timetable for being phased out. They want quotas to be voluntary and constantly adjusted to suit the needs of steel users. The importers also say semifinished steel products imported by American producers should not be covered by the quota plan. The interests of steel-consuming manufacturers should get equal consideration with those of the large steel producers, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. Those steel-users `` create 25 times more value, employ 30 times more workers and export nearly 100 times more in dollar terms than the steel industry,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against major foreign currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported the country's trade deficit narrowed in December. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the December trade deficit declined to $ 11.9 billion from a revised November figure of $ 12.2 billion. The November shortfall was originally reported at $ 12.5 billion. One Milan trader had said that there would be a greater tendency to sell than buy the dollar should a neutral figure emerge from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> report. This trader defined a neutral result as somewhere between $ 11 billion and $ 12 billion. Milan traders said there were far fewer `` dollar bulls'' in the market than at the same time last week, due largely to mounting opinion that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was not about to hike <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> interest rates, as many had been expecting. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar improved against the British pound after the trade report. It cost $ 1.7720 to buy one pound compared with $ 1.7770 at midmorning and $ 1.7712 Thursday. Other dollar rates after the report was released with midmorning rates in parentheses and compared with late Thursday's levels included: 1.8440 -LRB- 1.8350 -RRB- West German marks, up from 1.8425; 1.5650 -LRB- 1.5590 -RRB- Swiss francs, up from 1.5643; 6.2685 -LRB- 6.2500 -RRB- <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> francs, down from 6.2725; 2.0760 -LRB- 2.0725 -RRB- Dutch guilders, down from 2.0790; 1,344.00 -LRB- 1,343.50 -RRB- Italian lire, down from 1,348.50; and, 1.1918 -LRB- 1.1875 -RRB- Canadian dollars, up from 1.1859. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.61 yen to a closing 125.72. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 126 yen after the report and 125.75 yen before. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 378 a troy ounce, down from $ 382.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 378.95. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 379, down from $ 382.50 bid late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.02 to close at a bid $ 380.18. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 5.80 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's $ 5.84.

 The $ 8.15 million awarded to a woman who said a <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> birth control device left her infertile was not so `` shockingly excessive'' as to force a new trial, a judge has ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> on Thursday denied the company's motion for a new trial, which it had asked for on several grounds, including juror misconduct, errors of evidence in the trial and excessive punitive damages. A jury in September found in favor of <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s claim that a Searle Copper-7 intrauterine device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her infertile. `` This court simply can not say that the verdict is so shockingly excessive, in the light of evidence and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law, that the court has grounds to force plaintiff to choose between a new trial or a reduced amount of punitive damages,'' <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, which plans to appeal, said in a statement issued after the ruling that it `` clearly believes that a new trial was warranted based on the evidence of jury misconduct.'' `` That flagrant misconduct occurred demonstrates the failure of the judicial system to assure a fair trial for both parties as required by federal law,'' the company said. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> rejected the claims of misconduct after questioning jurors in December. Three of the eight jurors had signed affidavits alleging they were victims of verbal harassment and intimidation and had been bullied into an `` unjust'' verdict by their fellow jurors. The affidavits also said newspaper accounts of the trial had been smuggled into the jury room. Attorneys for <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> presented evidence during the trial `` that would have allowed a reasonable jury to conclude that -LRB- <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> -RRB- knowingly placed millions of women ... at risk of serious infection, loss of fertility and surgery for removal of internal organs,'' <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> ruled. About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most widely used IUD in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it was withdrawn from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in January 1986.

The strike could come March 3 unless talks that started 16 months ago end in a settlement.

Machinists President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, trustee of Teamsters Local 928, has vowed `` a Teamster truck will not cross our picket lines.'' The impact of Machinist pickets would depend on whether courts allow them to picket entire airports or limit them to Eastern facilities. Teamsters represent a variety of employees at other airlines, including drivers of airline fuel trucks. Eastern is seeking $ 150 million in concessions over each of the next three years. The machinists have proposed a one-year wage freeze and raises totaling 8 percent over the next two years.

 The stock price of <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> manufacturer of sausage casings and plastics, has soared following a takeover bid by former <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> boss <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 4.50 a share to $ 37.25 Thursday in over-the-counter trading on news of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s $ 690 million offer. <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said it had discussions with <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on their proposal to acquire all of the company's outstanding stock for $ 38 a share.

 The <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. fast food chain's general accounting director has been indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of securities fraud in connection with insider trading. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShano </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, was charged Thursday with receiving and using confidential company information to avoid a $ 7,107 loss on stock involving the Anaheim-based <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. hamburger restaurants. A statement from <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Pannier </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Al remains an active employee of the company. This matter should have no effect on the company's business.

<HEAD>Dividends Up, But Still Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Along with rising stock prices, dividends have been making news with cheerful regularity in the investment world of late. Spurred on by strong earnings, such blue-chip companies as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> all have raised dividends in recent weeks. But some analysts doubt this marks the start of a major trend. Dividends still have a long way to go, they say, to regain anything like the stature and importance they were accorded a generation ago. Dividend payments by the companies that make up <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index rose `` an unusually strong'' 11 percent in 1988, says S & amp; P in its weekly publication The Outlook This year, however, the firm is projecting what it called `` a more typical'' 5 percent increase. When companies have found themselves with cash to spare in the 1980s, they have opted more and more frequently for an alternative to a dividend increase _ buying back some of their stock. A buyback gives each of the remaining shares outstanding an increased, though indirect, claim on a company's earnings. Unlike a dividend payment, it does not create a tax liability for individuals and other taxable investors. For investors that are n't subject to current taxes, such as pension funds, a buyback helps provide a stable market for those who wish to sell their shares, and leaves the rest free of the need to decide how and where to reinvest a cash payout. Three decades ago, it was an accepted principle that stocks should yield more than bonds to compensate for the extra risk they represented. Today, stocks' dividend yields, averaging about 3.5 percent, pale beside the 9 percent available from a virtually risk-free Treasury bill. Since World War II, the percentage of total earnings companies pay out in dividends has fluctuated in a range of roughly 40 percent to 60 percent. The high points came in the prosperous 1960s, and the lows occurred in the inflation-wracked'70s. Lately, this `` payout ratio'' has fallen once again to the extreme low end of its historic range. The absence of any drastic pickup in inflation argues for an upturn in the payout ratio soon, maintains <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. Day Inc. `` There's no evidence yet that the ratio is rising,'' he said in a recent commentary. `` But the third year in a row of non-accelerating inflation should cause companies to boost that payout. `` If they do n't, the risk is that somebody else will come along and increase shareholder value, and those managements will be looking for new jobs.'' Historically, dividend increases have been seen as tangible declarations of confidence and optimism from corporations, expressed in hard cash rather than verbal promises or projections. Analysts <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON>, in their advisory publication Futures Hotline, say positive trends in dividends do tend to work in the market's favor _ up to a point. By the time almost all the dividend news is favorable _ increases, resumptions, extra payouts as opposed to decreases or omissions _ it can be read as a danger signal, they say. `` At that level, the increasing dividends suggest that corporations are overconfident,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> conclude. `` When everything looks ` too good,' the market tends to be overbought and risky.''

<HEAD>Report: U.S.-Soviet Trade Proposal Would Allow Repatriation Of Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies is close to completing a proposed trade pact with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that would allow foreign businesses for the first time to take profits out of that country in dollars, according to a published report. Executives of the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>, and officials of more than 30 Soviet trade and economic organizations have negotiated for nine months to complete the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> said in its Feb. 27 issue. The accord, which was expected to be signed by early April, would clear the way for the six corporations to negotiate joint ventures in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and could prove to be the biggest and most complex trade agreement ever developed between the West and the Soviets, the magazine said. Central to the accord is the guarantee that the countries would be allowed to repatriate their profits in dollars from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A number of Western companies already have embarked on joint ventures in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but the inability to repatriate profits in dollars has been seen as a key obstacle in expanding that field. The American Trade Consortium companies include <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> merchant bank <ORGANIZATION> Mercator </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign companies generally can not take dollars from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because the country badly needs the currency to buy imports. Soviet exports are limited, so dollars are in short supply. Under the agreement, the companies earning dollars would create a cash pool and would be allowed to take dollars out in proportion to the amount of rubles they put in. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> would be a key cash provider at the outset, under the plan, through a joint venture for the export of Soviet oil. While the other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business would be mainly selling to the Soviet market for rubles, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> would be bringing in dollars. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings would then go into the cash pool to cover any profits that are repatriated by the companies. The hard currency <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies need to repatriate their profits will be guaranteed by Soviet institutions. The other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies also are working out their own deals. <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has been negotiating to produce blood analyzers and floppy disks as well as to sell film and operate photofinishing laboratories; <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Midland </PERSON> is negotiating to set up a factory to produce fructose, starch and ethanol; <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is looking to health products ventures; and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating the manufacture of cereals, crackers and cigarettes, the magazine stated. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is working on a venture to help the Soviets revitalize their auto industry starting with the import into the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> of its Scorpio model and eventually setting up production facilities. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION> offered to buy the partially built <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for use as business offices for the group. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted construction on the embassy because it was found to have been riddled with Soviet listening devices while the Soviets were building it.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Slip In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a continuation of the selling that brought soybean and wheat prices down sharply near the close of Thursday's session. Major factors in the sell-off include improved growing conditions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and reports that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has overcome some logistical hurdles to completing a sale of 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The development lessens the possibility that the Soviets will need to increase their purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, as some traders had hoped. The Brazilian government on Wednesday issued a report pegging the 1988-89 Brazilian soybean crop at 22.6 million metric tons, an increase from the 21.5 million to 22.1 million metric tons forecast in December. The improved outlook for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop is based on wetter weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, where drought conditions prevailed earlier in the growing season. In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.22 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.67 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 2.03 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with March at $ 7.25 -LCB- a Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .12 cent to .55 cent higher with April at 76.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .58 cent higher with March at 82.30 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with April at 41.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .57 cent lower to .28 cent higher with March at 37.85 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were narrowly mixed today in quiet trading after the government reported a widely-expected decline in the nation's trade deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond was off 3-32 point, or about $ 1 per $ 1,000 face amount, at midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 9.06 percent from 9.05 percent late Thursday. Corporate bonds prices edged up, however. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the December trade deficit declined to $ 11.9 billion from a revised November figure of $ 12.2 billion. The November shortfall was originally reported at $ 12.5 billion. Economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the bond market shrugged off the slight improvement in the trade picture because `` it was close to what was expected.'' He said trading was subdued as traders prepared for a three-day holiday weekend that will keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets closed on Monday. `` The market is still licking its wounds,'' <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON> said, referring to the steep decline that has sent some 30-year bond prices down by about 3 points over the past seven sessions. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments slipped 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were off 3-32 point and long-term issues fell -LRB- point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was unavailable. In corporate trading, industrials were up. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.57 to 297.75. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.78 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 8.48 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 9.05 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 8.55 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.27 percent as the discount rose 5 basis to 8.56 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 9 5-16 percent, down from 9 -RRB- percent late Thursday.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, back on the road championing his $ 1.16 trillion spending plan, said today he will personally participate in high-level budget talks next week and share responsibility with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for difficult spending cuts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had invited <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders to the White House next Tuesday, the day before he leaves on a five-day Far East trip, for a round of talks to speed a budget accord. `` Together, we've got to make the budget process work,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told students at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here. Next week's meeting appeared designed to blunt Democratic criticism that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget enabled him to take credit for proposing expanded social programs, while leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the unpopular job of finding ways to pay for them through cuts in other areas. Budget analysts say the spending plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled last week, while calling for restraints in defense spending but new initiatives in education, housing, child-care and environmental cleanup, falls about $ 9.6 billion to $ 11 billion short of meeting the deficit targets he set forth. `` I am committed to working closely with my friends on the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> to help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law for an April 15th budget resolution,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for a deficit in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 of no more than $ 100 billion _ down from an estimated $ 160 billion this year. Failure of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to meet the targets can result in across-the-board cuts in military as well as civilian programs. Direct involvement by a president this early in the budget process is rare. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised all along to work closely with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and engage in a number of bipartisan meetings with leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said next week's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting was `` the beginning of his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- personal involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the budget process.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not seeking to sidestep the usual legislative process, and that Tuesday's session likely would not involve any detailed `` number crunching'' over specific spending levels. The president told his audience that he had called the top five congressional leaders to attend the meeting: House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>., House Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said the chairmen and ranking minority members of the congressional budget, finance and appropriations committees would also be <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the session `` an opportunity to assess progress thus far, to go over some of the numbers that have emerged in preliminary sessions. The president also wanted to build momentum while he is out of the country'' visiting the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said those at the meeting would discuss `` where do we go from here, how do we get more direct negotiations.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the session was intended to demonstrate `` a spirit of bipartisanship'' and to show a readiness on his part to `` get on with the nation's business of getting a quick and early resolution to this budget crisis.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as he has done this week in two other out-of-Washington appearances, outlined the highlights of his budget plan, calling it `` responsive and responsible'' and `` fair-minded in its strategy.'' He gave particular emphasis to its proposed initiatives on education, including the first installment toward a $ 500 million program of grants for the nation's best schools. `` We have made education the Gateway Arch of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' the president declared, referring to the city's trademark steel arch on the banks of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> His talk at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here follows similar remarks on his budget to business leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Monday and to state legislators in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Today's address also stressed volunteerism in the private sector _ one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pet themes. `` My friends, from now on in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> any definition of a successful life must include serving others,'' he said, `` in child-care center, in the corporate boardroom, at the Rotary, at Little League, or a tutoring program, and in a church or synagogue.'' He characterized his budget as one that `` leaves power in the hands of the people'' and said, `` I know we can have a government with a heart as well as a head.'' `` We must forge strong partnerships between all levels of government and voluntary organizations, business corporations, and individuals _ to lend a hand, mend a wound, and help the less fortunate,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected the notion that he had been deliberately vague in the budget to put the onus on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> alone for coming up with unpopular spending cuts. `` Yes, there's a lot more detail that has to be hammered out. And we will work with them to satisfy their interests, and find out what they want. It's a two-way street,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an Oval Office interview with a group of reporters.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank to $ 137.34 billion in 1988, the first annual decline since 1980, as a surge in exports offset a relentless climb in imports, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said exports shot up to an all-time high of $ 322.22 billion last year, a dramatic 26.8 percent above the 1987 level, led by a boom in sales of American-manufactured products and farm goods. The huge gain in exports was enough to offset an 8.3 percent increase in imports, which also rose to a record level of $ 459.56 billion. For December, the trade deficit shrank slightly to $ 11.9 billion, down from a revised November figure of $ 12.2 billion. However, both November and December represented the highest imbalances between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported and what it sold abroad since August. Analysts are worried that the improvement in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading performance has stalled out. After improving dramatically in the first half of 1988, the deficit actually began to widen again toward the end of the year. Reversing that trend and getting further trade improvements is one of the major economic challenges facing the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The trade deficit along with the related federal budget deficit represent the twin towers of debt that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inherited from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Reacting to the report, the administration said it was committed to working for a further reduction in the trade deficit by boosting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitiveness on world markets and shrinking the budget deficit. Many analysts say the budget deficit has played a major role in the worsening trade performance of the 1980s by making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more dependent on foreign investment. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said congressional approval of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget, along with a cut in the capital gains tax, would help to further reduce the trade deficit. `` Reducing the cost of capital, increasing personal saving and promoting research and development will go a long way to ensure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wins at home and in the global marketplace,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in a statement. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the decline in the trade deficit `` good news. It does show steady improvement, a trend of improvement.'' He said the trade deficit had dropped 22 percent on a year-to-year basis. The $ 137.3 billion deficit for all of 1988 was down 19.4 percent from the all-time high of $ 170.3 billion set in 1987. It was the first year that the trade deficit has shown any improvement since it fell 12.5 percent to $ 31.4 billion in 1980, the last year of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, the deficit soared above the $ 100 billion mark as Americans' appetite for foreign goods proved insatiable. In 1985, then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> engineered a coordinated effort with major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to devalue the dollar on foreign currency markets in an effort to make <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods more competitive and imports more expensive. The strategy has proven successful in boosting exports but has had much less of an impact in curbing imports. Some economists believe the dollar will have to fall further to see more improvements in trade. Other analysts, owever, worry that steeper declines could scare off the foreign investors the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has come to depend on to finance its borrowing needs and could run the risk of igniting a new inflationary spiral. For 1988, the 26.8 percent surge in exports boosted the fortunes of American manufacturers, who hired thousands of new workers and rushed to expand production facilities. The narrowing of the trade deficit and the boom in business investment contributed fully half of overall economic growth in 1988. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration must now work to promote further export increases in 1989 or run the risk that economic growth will slow appreciably. This would be a setback for the administration's other economic problem: finding a way to reduce the huge federal budget deficit. For 1988, sales of manufactured goods surged 25.2 percent to $ 214.8 billion, reflecting increases in a variety of categories from office equipment to airplanes. Sales of agricultural products were up an even stronger 29.3 percent to $ 37 billion, but analysts said much of this increase reflected higher prices caused by last summer's drought. As usual, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest trade imbalance was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a deficit of $ 55.4 billion, down 7.3 percent from the all-time high set in 1987. The deficit with the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> was down even more sharply, falling 47.2 percent to $ 12.8 billion for 1988. The deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partner, declined by 9.6 percent to $ 10.6 billion. For December, imports and exports both rose to record monthly highs. Exports climbed 5.6 percent to $ 29.19 billion and imports jumped 3.3 percent to $ 41.09 billion. Many economists are predicting that, based on recent trends, the 1989 deficit will rise. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economic forecasting firm, said he expected the 1989 trade deficit to rise to $ 150 billion. Such an increase would act as a sharp drag on overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product. Many economists forecast the overall GNP will grow just 2.7 percent in 1989, down from a four-year high of 3.8 percent in 1988. This economic slowdown would spell trouble for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which is counting on continued rapid growth to boost government revenues and lower the budget deficit. On Thursday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration will try to keep the export boom alive by seeking to reduce barriers that are keeping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products out of foreign markets. `` We've got to knock down barriers, and we will relentlessly pursue negotiations to end subsidies that distort markets and that restrict trade,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 The Big Three automakers set a record with combined earnings of $ 11.21 billion last year, but forecasts of slower economic growth are casting doubt on whether the bonanza can continue. `` I think we're getting a little closer to saturating the market in cars, and interest rates will begin to take their toll,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who predicts Big Three earnings will fall 10 percent to 15 percent in 1989. The combined earnings of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for 1988 were up 14.5 percent from the previous combined record of $ 9.79 billion in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> told its employees today they would get profit-sharing checks of about $ 2,800 apiece next month, lower than last year's $ 3,700 because of a decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> earnings <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is giving profit-sharing checks of about $ 254 per employee. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s will be about $ 720 Analysts predict the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will soften this year, taking the auto industry with it. New vehicle sales for the 1989 model year are forecast to fall from the 15.6 million cars and light trucks sold for 1988 _ the third best on record _ to about 15 million. Given the economic climate, a decrease in vehicle sales might be better than an increase `` because the increase would imply an economic boom, and busts follow booms,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON>, an auto analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. And even with lower sales and a 15 percent earnings decline in 1989, <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> `` would still be at a healthy level from an earnings point of view. Executives from each of the Big Three said cost-cutting programs helped boost 1988 earnings. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it saved $ 4.8 billion by trimming costs. But one of the unknowns in the automakers' future earnings equations is the cost of buying incentives that customers have come to expect. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the company spent about $ 4.2 billion on incentives and discounts on option packages in 1988, 55.6 percent more than in 1987. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s finance vice president and treasurer, said the No. 2 automaker spent about $ 400 million more on incentives in 1988 than the previous year. He declined to disclose specifics, but estimated that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spent about 25 percent less per car on incentives than <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> declined to say how much incentives cost the No. 3 automaker last year or how it compared with 1987. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has used incentives liberally, gaining market share by selling more cars while losing profits. Besides forecasts of dropping vehicle sales volumes and continued cost - cutting, some experts fear there could be a recession in the next few years But even that, some analysts said, would n't be a disastrous for the automobile industry. <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> said the Big Three could increase earnings by 50 percent over the next five years on flat or lower sales, through massive cutbacks. `` Recessions have a tendency to create belt-tightening,'' he said. `` The best is yet to come when it comes to the cost-cutting potential.''

 With a strike deadline looming, a federal judge issued injunctions today against both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union to resolve an aircraft maintenance dispute that the carrier says has grounded 17 jetliners. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> ruled the militant union must work on 12 grounded aircraft and members must work overtime if required by the carrier `` with no slowdowns and no sickouts.'' He also decided that work already begun by outside contractors hired by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on five aircraft will be allowed to continue, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been barred from farming out any more such work during a 30-day cooling-off period in their stalled talks. If no contract agreement is reached by midnight March 3, Eastern is free to impose its own work rules and the 8,500-hundred member union representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> machinists, baggage handlers and other ground crews are free to strike. `` We have 17 aircraft on the ground, normally we have zero,'' Eastern attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> told the judge as the airline fought the union's motion to keep all maintenance work in house. `` We ca n't get these done even if we get back to full production.'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> contended there was too much backlog for the Machinists alone to handle the work, and outsiders are needed to get all of the aircraft back in service. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, attorney for the union, responded: `` It's our work. We can do it. We will work overtime if required, and there will be no slowdowns.'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> kept repeating that the Machinists will be pushed to the limit as new aircraft come in for maintenance, and <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> repeated the union's arguments that the work has traditionally been down by organized labor. With the attorneys bickering, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> broke in and said, `` I've made my ruling There will be no more planes or equipment shipped, but the work may continue on the five planes that are already undergoing work.'' `` I am entering an injunction against both sides effective from now on until March 3. The company can continue the work on the five that are already out, but no more will be shipped,'' the judge said. `` The union will do all the work required of them, including overtime if asked with no slowdowns and no sickouts.'' His verbal order will be backed by a written decision in the afternoon, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the groundings first disclosed in court Wednesday have forced the airline `` to adjust the schedules downward.'' He said passengers were being warned in advance of any cancellations. `` Even the present backlog of grounded aircraft is totally unacceptable and poses a severe threat to a company in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s dire financial condition,'' the Miami-based carrier wrote in its court briefs Wildcat walkouts earlier this month `` were overt acts of economic warfare and tended to further the bargaining goals'' of the union, the filing said. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> local, blamed the delays on management's actions in preparation for a possible strike. `` We feel the company has purposely shipped out the parts, shipped out equipment and depleted the number of personnel available to work,'' <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON> said. `` They suspend a crew, then turn around and farm out the work because there was nobody to do the job.'' Eastern, a subsidiary of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported losses estimated at $ 335.4 million for 1988.

<HEAD>ICC Approves 5-Year Antitrust Exemption For Trailer Train</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved today a 5-year antitrust exemption that allows a company owned by major railroads to continue controlling rail car purchases. The company, <ORGANIZATION> Trailer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Train </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, had asked for a 15-year extension over the objections of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and a major rail car builder. The commission imposed some conditions on the arrangement and the final wording was being worked out, said <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> gave the company an extension of a pooling arrangement critics say amounts to a `` monopsony.'' This is an antitrust term for a company that controls purchasing in an industry, often enabling it to set prices and dictate product development. Trailer Train, which is owned by 22 railroads, controls about 80 percent of the nation's railroad flatcar fleet, including the vast majority of intermodal cars, which are used to carry standardized containers that also are loaded onto ships and trucks. `` The arrangement, including joint purchasing and ownershp of rail cars, will be in the interest of better service to the public and economy of operation, and will not unreasonably restrain competition,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> said in its ruling. The company's pooling and leasing procedures allow railroads to exchange cars so they can be used more efficiently and not have to return empty. The commission also approved a proposed stock ownership redistribution which extends ownership of Trailer Train to some smaller railroads. Critics, including a company that has sold thousands of railcars to Trailer Train, said prior to the decision that competition among railcar suppliers will not survive if Trailer Train continues to have control over purchasing for all of the nation's railroads. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Greenbrier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, whose subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Gunderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> builds railcars in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said, `` Under these current conditions, Trailer Train can, with government sanction, abuse this tremendous economic power. We know they have abused it in their dealings with us.'' <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> noted that airlines are not allowed to pool together and buy airplanes, `` nor can the railcar builders join together to acquire raw materials, fix prices or allocate markets.'' He said the number of companies building freight cars has fallen from 20 in 1979 to four today. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in November 1987 questioned Trailer Train's antitrust immunity and asked the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> to hold hearings and reconsider before deciding whether to grant an extension. Today's decision followed a 15-month investigation, including hearings before an <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, whose pension fund has a 10 percent interest in <LOCATION> Gunderson </LOCATION>, supported the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s action. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approval, which takes effect in 30 days, is subject to reconsideration if anyone can show the commission that the pooling arrangement has not resulted in better service to the public or more economic operation or has hindered competition, the commission said. The decision gives Trailer Train an antitrust exemption through Sept. 30, 1994.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, in its waning days as operator of a Northeast air shuttle, is offering its shuttle passengers $ 50 department store gift certificates in a bid to lure fliers from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s rival service and keep its own passengers from defecting. Ailing Eastern started the promotion last month, a few weeks after <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> started mailing its frequent shuttle passengers coupons worth $ 25 off a one-way Pan Am shuttle ticket. The $ 50 Eastern certificates, redeemable at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and other well known department stores in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, are given to passengers buying round-trip tickets. Two or more of the certificates may be combined toward a purchase and certificates must be redeemed by March 15. `` They -LRB- Eastern -RRB- are trying to hold the shuttle together,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, president of DMS Travel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They're using this as an incentive, as a bribe to keep people on the shuttle.'' One-way shuttle fares are $ 99 during peak hours. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which faces the threat of a possible strike by its machinists union on March 3, also has introduced coupons for the rest of its domestic system offering passengers big discounts if they fly after that date. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who recently cleared a number of regulatory hurdles, is scheduled to complete his $ 365 million acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shuttle sometime next month. Eastern _ whose shuttle carries about 3 million passengers annually _ and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> are locked in fierce competition over their lucrative shuttle services, which fly hourly between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and are used mainly by business travelers. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> launched a new advertising campaign for its shuttle service, calling it the `` Corporate Jet.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> officials denied that the new ad blitz was planned in anticipation of the flamboyant <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s debut as a competitor. But they conceded that curiosity and publicity about <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will prompt some passengers to take his shuttle service on a trial basis. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said its service now commands nearly 50 percent of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle market it shares with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. The gift certificates are `` an attempt by Eastern to thank people for their loyalty,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shuttle, said in a telephone interview. He denied that the promotion was designed to match <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s flight credit coupons. Nobles formerly was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and left about a year ago to work for Eastern. `` We've really had a wonderful response -LRB- to the certificates -RRB-; we have seen an increase in customers on the shuttle,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cori </PERSON> <PERSON> Zywotow </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. She declined to specify the increase in shuttle bookings which the airline attributes to the certificate giveaway. The $ 50 certificates can be redeemed at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area; <PERSON> Garfinckel </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Woodward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lothrop </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 British media baron <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> canceled a major address Friday on the launch of his English-language newspaper, The European, saying his editorial team was not yet `` pursuing shared goals and a unified concept.'' The launch of the new daily, aiming to start with half a million readers across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in early May, has already been postponed once. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, however, said in a last-minute letter in which he withdrew as a keynote speaker at a European conference of Foreign Press Associations that he had a `` total commitment to launching The European as the first pan-European paper.'' The 65-year-old <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who bought the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing giant <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.6 billion last fall, oversees a publishing empire with operations in 28 countries and 40,000 employees. `` I would rather make sure this important project is right than stick to a preconceived timetable and get it wrong,'' he said. `` Until I can be satisfied as publisher and editor-in-chief that the English and French components of our editorial team are fully and successfully integrated and pursuing shared goals and a unified concept, I will not launch the paper,'' he added, saying he would have another announcement next month. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> immediately came under attack from participants at the conference, aimed at setting the groundwork for better working conditions for foreign correspondents around the world, particularly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalfari </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s largest circulation daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>, called the concept of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> European `` a bestiality,'' adding that there was no such thing as European public opinion or unified taste. He claimed that <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> was closing a printing plant in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and firing some employees, reflecting difficulties in starting such a newspaper. <PERSON> Scalfari </PERSON> supported the concept of national newspapers distributed abroad, and challenged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to allow a newspaper owned by Western Europeans to be printed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and distributed throughout the country. The two-day conference, inaugurated by Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, also heard a proposal by the president of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s state-owned television system to start a European newsfilm agency to counteract American dominance of the field The new Federation of Foreign Press Associations will seek to avoid restrictions such as censorship and travel bans, and try to limit physical harm to foreign correspondents around the world.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices closed higher Friday after an afternoon rally sparked by strong early Wall Street gains helped the British market recoup earlier losses. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.1 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,042.9, its best level for the day. The index moved in negative territory for most of the session, losing as much as 14.5 points at late morning. Volume was thin, with 464.5 million shares traded, down from Thursday's 644.1 million shares. Trading activity was light amid what dealers said was uncertainty about the market's direction. A slight amount of buying interest late in the day sparked widespread markups, they said. The market shrugged off a sharp rise in British inflation. There also was scant reaction to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report that fell within market expectations, dealers said.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, reorganizing again, said Friday it would decentralize this year by giving more power to the heads of 15 to 25 business units.

 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the investment whiz turned crook whose squealings spawned Wall Street's insider trading scandal, is briefing business school students about a subject he knows: white-collar crime. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, paroled from a federal prison last year, told his story of greed gone awry to about 90 rapt <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students Thursday in a tightly guarded and unpublicized session, people who attended said. The visit to the prestigious school came against a background of increased emphasis on ethics by business educators, partly because of criminal behavior in the seductive high-stakes world of securities and commodities trading. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who was not paid to speak at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, traced his involvement in a five-year scheme that turned $ 40,000 into $ 12.6 million in illegal profits via his trades on illegally obtained information about pending corporate takeovers. `` He said it's very easy in such a heady exciting atmosphere simply to lose yourself in the enormously competitive race,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, who teaches ethics and attended the speech. `` He now realizes it was a major source of his downfall.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, 36, was paroled last September from a two-year prison term for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He remains under the supervision of federal probation authorities until April. In a plea bargain with government prosecutors, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> pleaded guilty to four felonies, was fined $ 362,000 and returned $ 11.6 million in illegal profits. The ex-investment banker, who worked at several investment firms, is best known for snitching on <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned insider trader who himself made millions of dollars using information supplied by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. Both men are key figures in a corruption scandal that has dogged Wall Street for nearly three years. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s appearance at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was endorsed by ethics experts and former prosecutors, who said the theoretical approach by business schools to social responsibility could use some real-life lessons from financial felons. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who arrested <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> in May 1986, said that as long as <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> is n't making money by peddling his life story on the campus lecture circuit, speaking would be effective. `` When you have close physical contact with someone who's really gone through the ringer, all these penalties you read about take on a new reality,'' said <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON>, who is now in private practice. `` I think he might be able to tell them things about his experience they may never be able to get out of a book,'' he said. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> would be permitted to profit on a book about his experiences under a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law that prohibits only violent criminals from exploiting their stories for money. But he has kept a low profile since his release and is said to be occupied with pending civil suits against him. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> is permanently barred from working on Wall Street. His attorneys did not return telephone calls Friday. Another famous insider trader, former <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>, went on a speaking tour and wrote a book after he was convicted of securities fraud charges. <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> in 1983 agreed to tip a broker about upcoming market-sensitive newspaper columns in exhange for a cut of the broker's profits. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> agreed to speak on a guarantee of no publicity. The school deployed a public relations staffer in the lobby to keep at least one newspaper reporter away from <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> was brought to campus by a student group called MORES _ Managing Organizations Responsibly, Ethically and Successfully _ with the approval of the dean. Only students in the group and two ethics classes could attend. According to students who attended the speech, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> praised the skill of government prosecutors and said he made naive and foolish mistakes but never clearly stated that the ordeal fundamentally altered his values. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s remarks, they said, were more about law-breaking than ethics-making. <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> said students were `` quite skeptical of a man who could get himself into these problems and not have greater qualms about it.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> spoke for about 20 minutes then answered questions for more than an hour. He was dressed in a dark suit like the investment banker he once was. `` I told him privately he would have been much more effective if he came dressed in sackcloth and ashes,'' <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices kept climbing today after a monthly report on trade that came in close to expectations. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.11 to 2,325.54 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 894 up, 511 down and 515 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 11.89 billion in December from a revised $ 12.22 billion the month before The latest figure jibed with Wall Street estimates in the neighborhood of $ 12 billion, although both exports and imports were a bit stronger than expected. Analysts said the figures raised some concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be inclined to tighten credit further. But they also noted a general sense of relief that the trade data did n't contain any unpleasant surprises, as some talk on the Street had suggested Thursday. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 48 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 98 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -RRB- at 51 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- at 91 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LRB- at 47 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> dropped -RRB- to 5 -RCB- in active trading. On Thursday the company reported lower earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 to 44, hitting a 52-week high. The company said Thursday it expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent through 1991, somewhat more than its historical targets. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .86 to 166.37. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .53 at 325.68.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge In Late Trading</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices rallied higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the market digested the day's bearish news and adjusted to the reality of tight supplies. Grain futures advanced modestly. The surge in soybean futures brought the market off its lowest level this year. Earlier in the day, soybeans for delivery in March had fallen to $ 7.22 a bushel on reports of steadily improving growing conditions for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop. The Brazilian government had issued a report on Wednesday pegging the 1988-89 Brazilian soybean crop at 22.6 million metric tons, an increase from the 21.5 million to 22.1 million metric tons forecast in December. The improved South American crop prospects have kept the soybean market under pressure most of this month. But Friday's rally suggested traders had refocused on the tight supply situation created by last summer's drought. `` Everybody lost sight of the major point that there are very few beans in the world at this point,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 More than 150,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers will receive profit-sharing checks of at least $ 2,800 apiece next month, the second-largest such payout in company history, executives said Friday. The amount is 10 times more than the profit-sharing payments <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees will receive and nearly four times as large as the planned payment to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> payments, which total $ 460 million, will be split among workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, some salaried employees and some laid-off and retired workers. The exact number of workers eligible for the payments and the precise amount of money will be set by the time checks are mailed March 6, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>. At <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, eligible workers will receive profit-sharing checks of about $ 254, while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> employees will receive average payments of $ 720 next month. The profit-sharing payments outlined in the companies' contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> are tied to earnings in the Big Three's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations. The Chrysler payment announced Feb. 2 is the first linked to corporate profitability and will be sent to about 80,000 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> paid its UAW-represented workers about $ 500 each in lieu of profit-sharing checks during the last two years. On Tuesday, about 470,000 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers learned they would receive profit-sharing checks for the first time in three years. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees got about $ 3,700 apiece. But earnings from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations shrank this year at the nation's No. 2 automaker, reducing the profit-sharing checks. `` Ford's current track record of immense profitability gives the company unique opportunities, which it should carry out, to be used to strive for better quality, better health and safety and better working environmets in the plants,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON>, head of the union's <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement Friday. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON>, the associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Industrial Relations at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said it was unlikely profit sharing would produce immediate effects on automobile production or quality. `` In the long term, it might,'' he said. `` Profit-sharing in most American firms is a fairly recent kind of innovation. What we do n't know about is very large-scale operations or huge corporations like <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Rising Crackdown on Foreign Stock Frauds Partly Result of US Influence</HEAD>

 From the Champs Elysees to the Japanese Parliament to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s waterfront stock market, authorities suddenly are prosecuting securities frauds that had been ignored, overlooked or condoned for years. The enforcement campaigns have led to embarrassing scandals in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and elsewhere for crimes that range from profiteering on inside information to bribery and embezzlement. To many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities-law specialists, an intriguing common thread among these crackdowns is their coincidental timing. Some experts believe the highly publicized insider trading scandal on Wall Street has jolted foreign governments into scrutinizing sleazy practices in their own backyards. `` I think what's been happening in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the last five years has caused countries like <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to beef up enforcement efforts in terms of securities regulation,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, a legal studies professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> business school. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Loss </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor who has been consulted by foreign governments in drafting securities regulations, said many were several decades behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in anti-fraud enforcement and only now were grappling with the severity of white-collar crime. Part of the reason, Loss speculated, is `` they've read about the financial scandals in our country.'' He also said they're beginning to understand the necessity of at least trying to show investors that their markets are fair, because `` you're not going to play cards with me if I've got a marked deck.'' Others said the explosive worldwide expansion of the securities industry over the past several years, coupled with quantum leaps in communication technology that make cross-border trading easy, have forced many governments to toughen previously lax anti-fraud laws. `` We've seen more scandals because the markets are growing,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, associate director for international affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The bottom line is you can trade in any market now from anywhere in the world and get your money to that market to close the deal,'' he said. To be sure, insider trading, manipulation and other shady market practices long deemed illegal in this country remain widespread in many parts of the noncommunist world. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, stock prices of companies targeted for takeovers often rise sharply at least one month before the official public announcements of deals, although insider trading has been illegal since 1980. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where insider trading is not only tolerated but a term for insider does n't exist in the language, stock prices regularly rise in advance of improved earnings reports. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, historically a haven for the profits of illegal financial dealings because of tough bank-secrecy laws, only made insider trading a crime last July. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s freewheeling stock exchange, which many trading professionals have likened to the Dodge City of international securities markets, conflicts of interest are said to be a way of life. It was the only exchange to shut down for completely for four days after the October 1987 crash. Eight market officials including former Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> were arrested later on charges of taking bribes. Things are n't much better in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where earlier this month prosecutors arrested four top brokers and interrogated dozens more in connection with widespread fraud allegations that range from insider trading to sale of phony securities. Almost all of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 24 registered brokerage houses have been implicated, and securities regulators have promised tough new rules <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, home to the biggest stock market, modeled its postwar laws on securities fraud after those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but rarely enforced them. One reason, said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, is `` the Japanese never felt insider trading was wrong.'' A recent Japanese move to put teeth in its laws has since led to a massive stock-trading scandal that's jolted the country's governing party and created a nationwide debate about business ethics The scandal involved the sale of thousands of shares of unlisted stock by the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to politicians and other prominent people at bargain prices. The buyers reaped windfalls when the shares were publicly traded later. Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other senior-level aides have resigned, and there has been speculation about the involvement of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. An equally serious scandal has been dogging <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s government because of an intensified securities-fraud enforcement campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourse </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s market regulator. The commission found evidence of blatant insider trading in the stock of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> immediately before it was taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a French metalmaker. Those implicated included businessmen with close ties to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. It is unclear why the French commission seized upon the Triangle takeover as the launchpad for what has become daily front-page news in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. But people familiar with the probe have said the French were tipped off by their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which has been attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and several other countries for policing international market frauds. To date, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has only secured cooperation agreements with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, three Canadian provinces and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Many countries simply ignore <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requests for help in tracking paper trails, and some have laws that ban foreigners from gaining access to any financial records. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> declined to say whether the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> played a role in the Triangle-Pechiney affair. But he said the need for international cooperation in securities law is one of the most sensitive problems faced by the enforcement agency. `` From the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> perspective, the focus is to try to work out arrangements with foreign countries that allow us to properly enforce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws without infringing on the sovereignty of those countries,'' he said.
