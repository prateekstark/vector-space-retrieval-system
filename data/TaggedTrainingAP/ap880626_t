<HEAD>Two Sides Reach Agreement on Territory's Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s separatist movement and the islands' conservative pro-French deputy reached agreement early Sunday on the future of the troubled territory, Prime Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> announced. He said that under the accord, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> will assume direct control of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory for the next 12 months, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonians </LOCATION> voting in referendum in 10 years on the issue of self-determination. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> also said he would propose to President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> that the French people be consulted in a referendum on new institutions to be set up to develop the territory. Tensions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, an island group 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, have remained high 21 people were killed in May when a French army assault team stormed a cave to free 23 hostages held by native Melanesian separatists. Thirty people have died in violence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> since April 22. The accord reached Sunday came after negotations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> involving <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and deputy <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON>. The Kanaks, or Melanesians, represent about 43 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s 145,000 residents, and most favor independence. The rest of the population comprises descendents of European settlers, Asians and Polynesians, most of whom prefer to remain French. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> colonized the islands in 1853. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> brought <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> and <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON> together last week for their first meeting since 1982. He said they both would take the agreement to their respective constituencies and call for approval. Tjibaou called the agreement reached Sunday `` an important step'' but said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> problem has not been solved and native Melanesians will continue to demand independence. He said the talks were difficult because the demands of the two sides were contradictory and because of the tense atmosphere in the territory. `` Each side now is committed to halt bloodshed and end mourning for many families, `` Tjibaou said. A statement issued by <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> called on the territory's inhabitants to `` be hopeful for a new page has been turned, not by arms but by dialogue and tolerance, by hard work and good will. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> made a solution to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> problem a priority after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> named him prime minister 45 days ago. The agreement seems likely to restore some of <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s prestige, which was tarnished after the Socialists failed to win a majority in legislative elections that followed the May 8 presidential vote.

 A new <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jetliner carrying more than 130 people crashed into a forest Sunday during an air show demonstration flight, killing at least three people and injuring 98, officials said. Many victims were believed to be first-time fliers who paid for a ride on the twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320, which was delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> only Thursday. Witnesses said the plane, which touts a state-of-the-art electronic flight system, had just passed over the airfield hosting the show when it crashed, tearing a nearly 500-foot path through the woods. Part of the plane caught fire. A control tower official said the jet appeared to lose power as it passed over the field in <LOCATION> Habsheim </LOCATION>, a village about 15 miles from the Swiss border. Monday's editions of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> daily newspaper L'Humanite quoted the jet's pilot as telling a rescue worker: `` I wanted to to increase the power but the aircraft did not respond.'' `` It was about 20 meters -LRB- 65 feet -RRB- above the ground with its flaps and landing gear down when it clipped some trees at the end of the runway and crashed in the forest,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Labalette </PERSON>, an amateur pilot, was quoted by <PERSON> Agence </PERSON> <PERSON> France-Presse </PERSON> as saying. Visibility was perfect. A 25-year-old woman passenger who did not give her name was quoted by AFP as saying she heard trees brush against the fuselage. `` From then on things went fast,'' she said. `` The plane hit the ground hard and we had the feeling of an abrupt jolt. Then there was a fire in the front of the aircraft.'' Flight attendants deployed evacuation chutes and the woman said she and other passengers slid down and ran away, fearing an explosion. Rescuers worked throughout the afternoon to evacuate dozens of people trapped in the battered plane. The impact broke the plane's wings and smashed the cockpit windows The fuselage was blackened from smoke, <ORGANIZATION> AFP </ORGANIZATION> said. Local officials said 50 people were hospitalized. It was not clear how many were on the jet as there was no official passenger list. Authorities said at least 136 were aboard. Officials said the pilot, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Asseline </PERSON>, and the co-pilot, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazieres </PERSON>, were not injured. Initial reports said four people were killed. The local officials, not named in accordance with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> practice, later said they were able to confirm three deaths. They said some victims were badly burned. `` There was an explosion and a cloud of smoke. But from the control tower we could n't see,'' said the tower official, who did not give his name. He said about 1,000 people were at the show and that many on the plane were making their first flight. At such air shows, spectators are invited to participate in an `` air baptism,'' or take their first flight for a small fee. The plane made six flights on Saturday. The A320, built in <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by a European consortium, went into service in April for <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. It was conceived and certified for flight by a two-member crew, eliminating the navigator. Early this year, pilots and flight engineers of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, the largest French airline, called a series of strikes to protest the use of only two cockpit members in A320s, saying it was unsafe. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> suspended service on its two A320 aircraft as a precautionary measure pending information on the cause of the accident in <LOCATION> Habsheim </LOCATION>, which is just outside <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION> and 250 miles east of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Air <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said that as a precaution, the airline was replacing an A320 due to fly to <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Sunday night with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 and canceling a Paris-Zurich flight. French Transport Minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mermez </PERSON> said a commission of inquiry would begin work Monday. The Airbus A320 can carry 168 passengers. Airbus Indusrie, its manufacturer, has orders to purchase 500 of the craft. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy some of the A320s for delivery in 1990 and 1991. `` I doubt -LRB- the crash -RRB- would have an impact on our decision to purchase from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON>, staff vice president of corporate communications for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday. `` But obviously we would want to check into the cause of the crash.'' Air <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has three of the aircraft, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has two and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, the French domestic airline, has one, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are disturbed, shocked and saddened,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> press spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alizart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION>. He said it was the first crash of an A320. <PERSON> Alizart </PERSON> said it was too early to say whether the future of the aircraft, which received its certification Feb. 26, could be in doubt. The plane has a range of about 3,700 miles and consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar two or three engine jets. It is the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully computerized flight-control system the manufacturer says permits safer, electronically controlled flight. Instead of the old control column in front of the pilot, there is a `` pistol-grip'' side stick linked to five computers that modify and relay the pilot's directions to wing and tail flaps

<HEAD>U.S. Drought Could Cause Severe Drop In World Grain Stocks</HEAD>

 Worldwide grain stocks could sink to their lowest levels of the decade and lead to possible food shortages if the crippling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought continues for another two weeks, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization. But officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> say favorable weather and crop prospects have created a brighter farm picture in most of the rest of the world. Before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought took hold, the Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization already was projecting that world grain production in 1988-89 would not match consumption and that stocks would drop close to the level the agency considers the minimum necessary to safeguard world food security. `` Now with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought, the question is how much is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production going to be drawn down,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON>, chief of the agency's global information and early warning service, said in an interview Friday. `` It's still too early for firm projections. It all depends on the rain in the next two weeks,'' he said. The organization had projected June that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would produce 279 million tons of this year's targeted 1.67 billion tons of grain worldwide. But that was before the worst drought since the Great Depression parched the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` If the present dry weather were to continue over the next couple of weeks, then there would be a severe shortfall in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crops, particularly maize -LRB- corn -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said. `` We had already projected that with normal weather conditions, the stocks could fall close to the minimum level. Now if the drought continues, there's a distinct possibility it could fall below that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization considers the minimum level to be 17 percent to 18 percent of the projected global consumption of wheat for the following year. The last time the level fell to the minimum level was in 1981. Stocks have not dropped below the minimum since the mid-1970s. They hit a low of 14 percent during the global food crisis of 1972-73. `` If stocks go below the mininum level, it would mean the world is more vulnerable than it should be and could face food supply difficulties,'' <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said. `` We've still got a cushion ... but if the cushion is going to be used up, it looks like the food situation on a global level is going to be a lot tighter.'' <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said the organization `` will have to be very vigilant'' in monitoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cereal crops and those in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Fortunately, harvest prospects outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are generally favorable,'' <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said. `` At this moment, we do n't see any widespread drought problems... nothing dramatic,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gommes </PERSON> of the agency's agro-meteorological The only country that produces more cereal crops than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with about 350 million tons annually. Third is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with 200 million tons. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said harvest prospects were good in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, drought has hit some areas and floods have hit others. `` But at this point we're not worried about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. An important factor for world crop production is the monsoon season in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which were hit by severe drought last year. `` The monsoon started in May on time this year, but it's still far too early to say what will happen,'' <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> said. One of the world's most serious food supply situations is occurring partly as a result of heavy rainfall in areas often prone to drought conditions. Swarms of migrating desert locusts, who breed in rainy conditions, have invaded the <LOCATION> Sahel </LOCATION> region of sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The infestation `` is of unprecedented dimensions and will affect the food security of 15 African countries, from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> group's director-general, <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON>, said Friday. In African countries such as <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, civil war has aggravated crop failures. In <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where drought and famine killed up to 1 million people in 1984-85, more than 7 million people are reported threatened by the drought and last year's crop failures. The crop planting season is now under way in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> so it wo n't be known until the end of the year whether the country can recover, <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> suffered severe drought last year but the weather has improved and <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> believes the harvest will recover. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, however, is expecting a shortfall of more than 1 million tons in its wheat harvest, he said.

 Thunderstorms battered scattered areas from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Sunday night, causing tornadoes in at least three states and at least two deaths in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, including a boy on a bicycle hit by falling trees. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> storm produced lightning fires and toppled power lines, leaving one-third of the city of <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> temporarily in darkness, authorities said. Two falling trees fatally injured 8-year-old <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> while he was riding his bicycle to his <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> home about 6:45 p.m., Police Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Deich </PERSON> said. `` It was just the worst possible timing,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Langerman </PERSON>, a witness. `` He was riding pretty fast, and if he had been two seconds faster or two seconds slower, nothing would have happened.'' Lightning struck and killed <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Mooresville </LOCATION> about 6:30 p.m. as he was headed for shore in a pontoon boat on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police said. About 7:30 p.m., the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported a solid line of thunderstorms that stretched across northern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border north of <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, and southwest across the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>. The storms were moving at about 30 mph, but winds were reported as high as 55 mph. In southeast <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, two homes were destroyed by what witnesses described as a tornado and dozens of vehicles were damaged when winds ripped part of the roof off the <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION> airport. Thunderstorms across <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> triggered heavy rains in some areas, a tornado in open country in <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and winds that blew windows out of a home near <LOCATION> Franktown </LOCATION>. One strong thunderstorm dropped 1.1 inches of rain and pea-sized hail in 35 minutes south of <LOCATION> Centennial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. That cloudburst caused local street flooding. Severe thunderstorms in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> spawned at least one tornado in the south-central part of the state, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. A tornado touched down about 8 p.m. in a rural area just north of <LOCATION> Partridge </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, a supervisor with the <ORGANIZATION> Reno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A small bomb was hurled at the home listed as the address of rapist-mutilator <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> on Saturday night, but the explosion caused no injuries or property damage, authorities said. The homemade bomb detonated in the front yard of the one-story home just before 9 p.m., said <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was not in the house, his whereabouts are still unknown at this time,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, and sister-in-law, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, were the only people in the home when the device exploded, leaving a heavy white cloud, the officer said. While many in the quiet <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> neighborhood heard the explosion, there were no witnesses to who threw the device, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Experts were examining bomb shards to determine what type of device it was. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker, chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead in a ditch southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1978. The gray-bearded 60-year-old former merchant seaman, who grew up in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison. He completed a year-long probation and is now a free man. During his probation, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was forced to flee six <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> towns after residents objected to his presence. He ended up finishing his probation in a trailer on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison. Two weeks ago, he listed the address with authorities as required of convicted felons under state law, but he has never been seen there. His brother has said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> lives `` about two hours away,'' but refuses to say exactly where. Angry area residents have held two meetings in the past month asking deputies to locate <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> so they can stop living in fear. A local businessman and a radio station have each offered <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> $ 5,000 if he will pack up and go anywhere else.

<HEAD>Baja Governor's Brothers Accused in Major Cocaine Smuggling Ring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two brothers of the state governor of <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> are under arrest on charges they took part in a sophisticated drug ring that smuggled cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities said. Authorities also said they arrested four others who participated in the operation. The arrests were announced late Friday by the federal attorney general's office. Authorities said rancher <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Liceaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruibal </PERSON>, 48, and businessman <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Liceaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruibal </PERSON>, 46, were part of a smuggling ring that operated clandestine air strips, safe houses and money-laundering businesses in several Mexican states. An emotional Gov. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Liceaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruibal </PERSON> called the case a `` family tragedy'' during a hastily called news conference in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, the state capital, late Friday. He said he knew nothing of his brother's activities. `` I am completely clean,'' he declared. The governor said state authorities cooperated fully with the federal investigation and would continue to do so. Authorities said his brothers allowed at least one of their ranches to be used for clandestine air strips where drug-laden planes en route from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refueled. Investigators said they have tracked at least 10 flights. In addition to the governor's brothers, four other people were arrested: <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Escamilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, who also used the name <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, was identified as head of the ring. Authorities said he laundered drug profits through his money exchange house in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> and a real estate company. The profits were allegedly stashed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican banks and in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where authorities said they found $ 10 million in a single account. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been recently reported to be a regional banking center for drug smugglers. In February, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted its military ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, on drug-trafficking charges. The attorney general's office said it has seized Pineada <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>'s property, which also included three homes and four ranches in the central state of <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION>. Authorities did not say when or where the arrests were made, but said all six suspects were transferred to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to face a variety of drug charges.

The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees federal parks, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office will decide whether to appeal the decision within 60 days, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` We think that the $ 7.5 million is fair, but no amount of money can compensate for what <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crider </PERSON> has suffered,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sley </PERSON>. `` This, however, will give him the chance at a meaningful life.'' <PERSON> Crider </PERSON> said park rangers <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Couser </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> had stopped <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> 10 hours before the accident for driving 40 mph in a 15-mph zone on a public road on <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The rangers ticketed <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> and allowed him to continue, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was brought from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON> to hear the case, ruled March 17 that not arresting <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> was `` an act of negligence and that, as a consequence, an accident occurred.'' Evidence at the trial showed that <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> had consumed 7 or 8 ounces of liquor and had smoked several marijuana cigarettes in the three or four hours before he was stopped for speeding. <PERSON> Sley </PERSON> had argued that the marijuana could have impaired <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>'s actions for 12 to 24 hours and that the alcohol intensified the effects of the marijuana. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in the accident, was sentenced to eight years in prison. <PERSON> Sley </PERSON>, who had sought $ 75 million, said the case could lead authorities around the nation to tighten enforcement of drunken-driving laws. `` I think -LRB- the award -RRB- sends a message throughout the nation that authorities have to enforce the drunk-driving laws or face serious liability exposure,'' he said. However, <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> rangers have not changed enforcement of drunken-driving laws since the March ruling, said park Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the park's superintendent. `` We might seek a little more advice from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, but our rangers are operating pretty much status quo,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said, adding that the judgment places an unfair burden on his rangers.

The appointment of <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>, a retired army colonel, was announced over the state-run television station Friday night along with that of other new civil servants. They were selected by the new military government of Lt.

The weekly lottery, which generates hundreds of thousands of dollars, is a national passion. There are almost as many ticket stalls in the capital as grocery stores. The Games <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is the body established to ensure the lottery is not rigged and that winners collect earnings. Under the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime, the corrupt administrative body was a lucrative source of income for the dictators and their allies. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> is widely reported to have participated in the 1964 mass murders of a number of prominent families in <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON>, a town in southwestern <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. He has gained a reputation for exceptional brutality after those and other killings. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> has maintained a low profile since the February l986 uprising that sent <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, ending 29 years of dictatorship by his family.

<TEXT>
 A four-week-long <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament missed its deadline and dragged on into Sunday after bitterly divided delegates failed to agree on a formula for world peace. The session, which was scheduled to end Saturday night, was extended after delegates could not reach a consensus on issues ranging from missile defense systems known as `` Star Wars'' to monitoring land-based weapons. After the progress of the U.S.-Soviet summits, the failure of this first General Assembly session on disarmament in six years to meet its timetable put on public display the deep divisions that still exist between East and West. Delegates to the $ 7.4 million session, which has heard 135 speakers since it began May 31, could only agree to allow a negotiating committee to continue work Saturday night. Informal consultations were expected through the night before participants reconvened, possibly early Sunday. Delegates have been locked in intense, sometimes acrimonious debate in efforts to forge a final document settng forth an agenda for peace. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some of its Western allies were at odds with most other nations on numerous issues, including priorities for nuclear and conventional disarmament, Third World disarmament and identifying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as regional offenders. Delegates and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was uncertain whether the world body would be able to adopt a final document by consensus and avoid a divisive vote.

<TEXT>
 Authorities suspect that an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve soldier who claimed he was stabbed by four Arabs while hitchhiking lied because he was late returning to his base, a police spokeswoman said Sunday. On Saturday, a bomb exploded near an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus as it headed to a Jewish settlement 37 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It damaged the vehicle but caused no injuries. The 38-year-old soldier, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON>, said the Arabs assaulted him and tried to grab his weapon Saturday as he hitchhiked at the Mesubim junction near the coastal city of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, an army spokesman had said. The Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> told police he was stabbed four times. However, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> police spokeswoman <PERSON> Shlomit </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzberg </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> had only scratches on his arm, not stab wounds. She said his version of events `` is suspect and we are checking whether it is correct.'' <PERSON> Herzberg </PERSON>, reached by telephone, said police believed the soldier may have made up the story to avoid punishment for failing to report on time for military duty. Police detained several Arabs for questioning immediately after the reported assault, but they were later freed, Mrs. <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON> said. Earlier Saturday, troops shot and wounded a Palestinian in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Kabul Airport Blaze Destroys Eight Soviet Jets; Guerrillas
Suspected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire at the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport destroyed eight Soviet jet fighters and may have been the result of an attack by Moslem guerrillas, Western diplomatic sources said Sunday. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said their counterparts in the Afghan capital first noted the fire on Friday. `` It looks like a -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- attack,'' said one western diplomat. He said that reliable sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported seeing two rockets hit the airport about two hours after the fire started. Diplomats said Soviet and Afghan government forces were fighting U.S.-backed guerrillas just west of the airport, on the northern outskirts of the capital. They said reports coming in late Saturday claimed eight Soviet Su-25 jet fighters exploded one after the other at the northwest end of the airport. A telex report from one Western embassy said: `` The loss is one of the largest soviet air losses of the war.'' Guerrilla activity was reported on the rise around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, with insurgents frequently moving within rocket range of the city. Guerrillas claimed to have rocketed the airport last week but not on the day reported by diplomats. Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to replace one Marxist government with another and battle the anti-communist insurgency. Soviet troops began withdrawing May 15 under the terms of a United Nations-sponsored peace accord.

Witnesses said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> jet, which went into service a month ago, clipped some trees at the edge of an airport runway and crashed in a field nearby. An unidentified passenger, a 25-year-old woman, was quoted by <PERSON> Agence </PERSON> <PERSON> France-Presse </PERSON> as saying that she heard she heard tree branches rub against the plane's fuselage. `` Things started moving fast,'' she said. `` The plane hit the ground hard and we had the feeling of a abrupt jolt.

She was quoted as saying that the plane's evacuation chutes were deployed and many passengers aboard slid down and got off, running a distance from the plane because they feared an explosion. The twin-engine jet was taking part in an air show in overcast, humid weather. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the accident occurred at 2:50 p.m. -LRB- 8:50 a.m. EDT -RRB- while the plane was on a low-altitude demonstration flight above the Mulhouse-Habsheim airport.

 Four steel bins filled with unsold grain are <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>'s hedge against a drought that wiped out his 1,300 acres of wheat, oats and rye this spring. As the drought drags on and grain prices soar, he's one of thousands of farmers who stand to make a tidy profit from selling their share of the billions of bushels of wheat and corn stockpiled around the nation. `` The drought makes it tough going, but, yes, we are going to get along quite comfortably,'' said <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>, 57, has 14,000 bushels of wheat stored in the bins on his 3,000-acre farm. The wheat is worth $ 3.85 a bushel, up $ 1.15 from a few weeks ago. The price likely will rise much more, perhaps as high as $ 7 a bushel, some have speculated. While some farmers worry whether they will have anything to sell at all this year, <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON> and his 26-year-old son, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>, worry whether they will sell too soon. `` If you sold it this week and it made another $ 1 jump next week, it would make you feel sick,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON> said. `` If you screw up a decision this year, you are screwing up. It just about gives you an ulcer trying to figure out what to do.'' The Rodenburgs represent a segment of the nation's farmers likely to withstand the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, farmers hold at least half of the 1.2 billion bushels of wheat and 5.6 billion bushels of corn in storage. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the nation's second-largest wheat producer after <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, 300 million bushels of wheat are held in storage, an amount equal to the state's average annual yield, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` People who do hold these stocks and do sell them are going to make a nice profit on it,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karem </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s farm program analyst. `` I think that's private enterprise,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Agricultural Stabilization and <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's terrible that a drought has to create something like that.'' Some of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s farmers have as much as 60,000 bushels of grain, mostly wheat, stored on their farms and under government loan, estimated <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> price support specialist in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. Farmers stand to make a profit on the stockpiled grain, even if they have to pay off their government loans to get it out of storage, said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the state <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. At last year's loan rate, they could make $ 1.50 to $ 2 a bushel, he said. <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON> is hesitant to talk about his good fortune at a time the drought could drive some of his neighbors out of business. The most he will say is that his farm income could be half of normal: `` But I do n't know. Let's leave it like that.'' A combination of insurance, government help, good planning and plain good luck will offset his losses. Insurance covers the seed and fertilizer on the crops that were destroyed. His land payments are minimal, since he owns 2,000 acres of his farm free and clear. What debt he does have is covered by $ 37.50-an-acre government payments on 900 acres of highly erodible land he took out of production. An emergency measure by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> let him cut the healthy crop of alfalfa on that land for hay. He'll lose some of his government payment on the land he hays, but the first field he cut produced about 1 -LCB- tons per acre, and he thinks hay may eventually sell for as much as $ 100 a ton. The potential income `` is going to be unreal,'' more than enough to pay for the baler he recently bought at a farm auction, he said. The government also may make up for the income <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON> lost when his crop was destroyed. Farm-belt members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> want the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to pay farmers the price guaranteed them when grain prices were low. That subsidy could mean at least $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 more for <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>. Years of `` hard work and reasonably good management'' allowed <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON> to pay off loans on the 2,000 acres of land he owns debt-free, but his fortunes could take a drastic turn if the drought lasts another season, he said. `` Next year, if we are standing here like this and under the same circumstances, I will be painting a far gloomier picture for us,'' he said, standing in the baking afternoon sun alongside his grain bins. `` I think I would be better off getting a good crop,'' the farmer said. `` I do n't believe you could ever have a drought where it indirectly really benefits you.''

<TEXT>
 Sunspot activity is increasing rapidly and, during the next few years, could lead to the most intense solar disturbances ever recorded, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Intense disturbances on the sun can have serious effects on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, including interference with broadcasting, damage to sensitive electronic systems in satellites and disturbances in electrical power and telephone transmissions. Some scientists also have speculated that activity on the sun could affect the climate on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, an idea that has prompted considerable controversy in the meteorological community. Changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallel with changes on the sun over the years. However, proving that the two are connected has, so far, eluded science. Sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years. Climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over periods of 11 years in the central and western states and over 22 years in the eastern states. The current cycle began in September 1986 and already has seen record rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun, according to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> NOAA-Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> The most active previous solar cycle occurred in 1958. Activity on the sun is already at about the same rate as in that year, but with somewhat more intensity. <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> noted that in a typical cycle sunspots increase to their maximum in about 4.3 years and then take some 6.6 years to decline to a minimum again. But cycles with rapid increases, as in the current case, have higher and earlier maximum levels. Sunspots themselves do not affect the Earth, but are used as indicators of other solar activity which does, such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms, bombarding the Earth with radiation. Among the potential problems associated with an increase in solar activity, according to <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON>, are: _ Increasing activity by the aurora borealis or northern lights -LRB- also the aurora australis, or southern lights, in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> -RRB- _ Interference with some kinds of radio communications and broadcasts _ Disturbances in electrical power transmission systems, pipelines and long-line telephone networks _ Damage to satellites' electronic systems _ Altered orbits of some satellites _ Radiation hazards to astronauts and aircraft passengers at high altitudes

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has used his Austrian tour to reach out to those nearby Roman Catholics whose Eastern bloc countries he has not been able to visit. While most attention on the five-day trip has focused on the pope's remarks about Jews and the Holocaust, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has also been looking to millions of Catholics in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. On Saturday, about 20,000 Yugoslav Catholics crossed the border to the nearby Austrian town of <LOCATION> Gurk </LOCATION> for an outdoor Mass. The day before, the pope said Mass for 80,000 Catholics, mostly Yugoslavs and Hungarians, in the town of <LOCATION> Trausdorf </LOCATION> near the Hungarian border. The pope has visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, his Communist homeland, three times since he became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in 1978. But so far, Communist governments have imposed barriers that have kept him from visiting millions of Catholics in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Czechoslovak Catholics in particular have been in conflict with Communist authorities, who until this year had not permitted any new bishops in their country since 1973. Earlier this month, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> authorities finally allowed three new ones. The estimated 20,000 Yugoslav Catholics joined about 40,000 Italians and Austrians for the outdoor Mass on Saturday in <LOCATION> Gurk </LOCATION>. `` You all give testimony of the power of Christian faith to overcome boundaries,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` Coming from several cultures, you as the people of God speak the one language of common belief.'' `` Unfortunately today in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, even in your regions, the ancient roots of faith are threatened in various ways,'' the pontiff said, changing briefly from German to Italian in his homily. He continued: `` Christians must, however, react as a community to this challenge. They must unite even more and stay even closer together.'' On Friday, he said his Mass for the 80,000 Catholics, mostly Yugoslavs and Hungarians, in <LOCATION> Trausdorf </LOCATION>. Several hundred Poles and several dozen Czechs also were on hand. Addressing the local Austrian Catholics, the pontiff said: `` This diocese and its bishop are well aware of their function as a link in particular with the peoples of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` You are ready to cultivate contacts with them and to share with them, materially and spiritually,'' he said. `` Must not the salvation <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> has given us again be spread to the farthest bounds of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>?'' Some Austrian newspapers hailed the Mass as a major gesture toward Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Trausdorf: A Signal for the East Bloc,'' trumpeted <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kleine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper in its Saturday editions Other newspapers, though, felt that the pontiff had kept his remarks deliberately low-key, possibly in hope of not upsetting any chances he may have of visiting any new Eastern European countries. `` He overcame barriers by not putting up any,'' said the conservative Die Presse daily newspaper of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bush `Truth Squad' Could Number 100 By Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls it his `` truth squad,'' an army of Republican stand-ins with orders to take shots at opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Democrat's camp has a less charitable label: `` hit squad.'' No matter the name, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surrogates _ made up of senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, governors, and other prominent Republicans _ are already having an impact on the 1988 presidential race. The surrogates are fanning out across the country and criticizing the all-but-certain <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee, sometimes speaking in the same cities hours before or after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a technique the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign calls `` bracketing.'' For a national campaign strapped for cash, the tactic is inexpensive and enables the vice president to get mileage from the sharp attacks without having to utter the words himself. The Republican strategy became apparent during a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> swing through the South last week when Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., spoke in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> a day ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, branding the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor soft on crime and an opponent of the death penalty <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called it negative campaigning and derided <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> as someone who `` does n't know beans from brown bread.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> footwork was not lost on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategists. A few days later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered a strong law-and-order speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. After the room cleared, one sheriff lingered near the press area Wearing a large `` Dukakis'' sticker, he was hard to miss. Sheriff <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rufo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which includes the city of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, suggested the vice president _ not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ lacked a crime-fighter's record. `` At all these conventions, there are going to be very strong <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters. They're not going to be shy,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, communications director for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. But <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said that, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have some surrogate speakers, he will not field anywhere near the number that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is using. `` Ultimately, this kind of tactic is not going to work. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s problem is he has n't articulated his own vision of the future. And that's what people want in a president, they're not looking for somebody who can organize a hit squad,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. Although surrogates have been used before, including elected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials who spoke out vociferously in 1984 in behalf of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s re-election effort, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is seeking to turn the practice into a science _ carefully targeting speakers to subjects and audiences. `` We have about 10 out there now. By the fall, we'll have 100,'' said <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who says the surrogate speakers will play a vital part in his campaign, told reporters last week that he thinks the differences between him and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remain out of focus _ and that's where the surrogate speakers will help. `` I've got to spell it out -LRB- the differences -RRB- and get surrogates _ those other people who believe as I do _ to spell it out,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Some of the surrogates have specific assignments. For instance, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s marching orders are to chip away at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' so-called `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle,'' which the neighboring governor derides as the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mirage.'' On Friday, for example, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters no one should be surprised at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' signing a $ 40 million cigarette tax into law because `` everytime he's had a problem, he's run to a tax increase _ even when he ran the first time and gave an iron-clad commitment there would be no tax increase.'' Former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is also speaking on behalf of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with the same message, and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> have also been active as surrogates. To counter his high negatives among women voters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is counting on a number of prominent GOP women, including Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to get out the word that he is concerned with issues that affect women. Vanquished GOP presidential rivals Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> are also busy on the surrogate circuit. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, `` has already been to nine state conventions and we will be to 20,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>. `` He's just crashing his way downfield.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are sharing the expenses of the surrogate program. But one Republican skeptical of the ultimate value of the technique is <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> senator who dogged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the South. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people were clearly stunned by this,'' said <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, noting that Democrats retaliated by attacking him at home for missing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes while campaigning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I was gone 24 hours. I missed five votes, all of which were either non-essential or carried by margins such as 92-to-3.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said that surrogate speakers have been used extensively in the past by both parties and that he believes the concept `` is helpful but only minimally'' to candidates. `` That's why I was intrigued at the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his people overreacted,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. `` I think it's ridiculous that he responds by saying I do n't know the difference between beans and brown bread. What kind of response is that?'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, who said he does know the difference, is turning down the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to pay for his trip. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, who expects to speak extensively in the West, said the surrogate program is a chance to correct what he claims are misconceptions among voters that are hurting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls. `` A lot of the polls show either two-fifths or three-fifths of the people polled said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was more conservative than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That is n't a loss of focus, that's a loss of your eyeglasses,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` There is n't any way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to pull that one off.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Furlough Program At Center Of Dukakis-Bush Crime
Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wages an aggressive effort to portray <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal who is soft on crime, the man at the center of the vice president's pitch is behind bars in a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison. Convicted murderer and rapist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is as much a part of the debate over crime this presidential campaign season as the opposite views on the death penalty espoused by the two candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now mentions <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> by name, in campaign rhetoric laced with attacks on a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that allowed <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> to be released from prison although he was serving a life sentence for murdering a 17-year-old boy. In 1987, during his 10th furlough, <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, twice raped a woman and assaulted her fiance. `` I think Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> owes the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an explanation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` What did the Democratic governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> think he was doing when he let convicted first-degree murderers out on weekend passes?'' A day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was told of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statement that 45 states and the federal prison system offer some form of furlough. The vice president responded that `` none, except <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, had furlough programs for first-degree murderers.'' But, according to several correctional associations and publications, at least 16 states offer furloughs to first-degree murderers. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> no longer is among them: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reluctantly signed a law banning first-degree lifers from furloughs. `` <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said that foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said when he signed the bill in April. `` I try to listen; I try to learn.'' Since the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program began in 1972, 117,700 furloughs were granted to 10,553 inmates. Of the 426 escapes, 11 occurred during the 4,908 furloughs granted to first-degree murderers. `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> actually had a pretty good record,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bemus </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> data center in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has amended his attack on the furlough program, accurately saying in recent days that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, until April, had the only furlough program in the nation for inmates sentenced to life without parole Campaign aides say the vice president will continue his attack. `` He finds this program of furloughing murderers with no-parole sentences represents the worst sort of approach to crime,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said Friday. `` The furlough issue is important because it shows how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on crime contrasts with the vice president's positions. As this issue has been elevated, I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are shocked at the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> example.'' Faced with growing criticism from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and increased media attention on the furlough program, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp has fired back with national furlough statistics showing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough-escape rate is below average and by invoking the name of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boss, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supported furloughs even after two convicts killed people while on furlough in the early 1970s. Like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inherited the furlough program from a governor of the opposition party. `` These are part and parcel of all kinds of responsible correction programs,'' says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has spent much of the past week defending the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program, largely by citing a 14 percent drop in crime in his state over the past five years. `` Our view is that the vice president is trying, through the furlough issue, to obscure the facts,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues adviser <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The fact is that while crime is going up nationally, crime is dropping dramatically in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` He also is using it to obscure the unenviable crimefighting record of the Reagan-Bush administration,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, who spent much of last week researching furlough programs. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is reacting to this issue in a sense that tells me he's running scared.'' If the criticisms continue, aides say, look for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to adopt the strategy he used when former rival Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> criticized the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program during the primary campaign. `` Al, the difference between you and me is that I have to run a criminal justice system. You never have,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said during an April debate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. That kind of response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would fit in with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategy to attempt to characterize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a do-nothing vice president. Among corrections officials and criminoligists, furloughs are considered an effective rehabilitation tool. `` Most knowledgeable correctional workers, prisoners and others interested in work furlough see it as a progressive correctional program,'' said a 1975 review of one program _ that of then-California Gov. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` There is no way that we're ever going to be 100 percent able to give you a program where the parole board or the furlough program has fallen down,'' said Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. He also questioned the relevance of the furlough issue in presidential politics. `` If freeing a murderer on furlough is the issue, then it's moot because murder is, except for in rare cases, a state crime and the president does n't really deal with murderers,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said.

 With less than a month to go before the Democratic National Convention, incomplete housing arrangements threaten the party's hopes for a smooth kickoff to its biggest media event of the year. But some of those who will be covering the gathering say they do n't expect problems severe enough to be noticed by the Democrats' real audience _ the millions of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters who be will watching or reading about the convention across the country While the city has been sprucing up for the visitors, the host committee and party organizers sometimes have been slow to provide information to reporters and others who have to make arrangements of their own, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for special events. But she said the problems probably wo n't affect the picture <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> presents to the public. `` The fact is we have to be ready for the event because they are n't going to delay it for us,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and her counterpart at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Buksbaum </PERSON>, gave convention organizers good marks for helping with television coverage. The complaints from news organizations center on off-the-floor matters, especially housing. `` Hotel rooms are really a problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Alongi </PERSON>, who said the network has received only a few rooms in downtown hotels. `` I just ca n't find enough words to describe how much trouble they're going to be in,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the office manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau, who said housing arrangements started much later in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> than in previous convention cities. The convention has fared better on other fronts. A newly opened rapid rail station at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> means delegates can reach downtown in 15 minutes for an 85-cent fare. Those traveling the route by car will have to contend with ongoing construction on the I-75-85 `` downtown connector,'' but the disarray has not proved a major problem to larger conventions. The city long ago gave up on Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s initial hope that a renovated Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> entertainment district could open in time for the convention, but delegates will be offered excursions on a steam-powered train line newly extended to the Stone Mountain tourist attraction. Once the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were defeated in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> playoffs, workers began building the huge stage, network anchor booths and other fixtures of the convention at the Omni Coliseum. `` It does seem finally to be coming together and more and more of the details are slowly being revealed,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, associate editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and deputy convention manager for <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a senior producer at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are on schedule and there's nothing new from any other convention in dealing with Democrats They always appear to be somewhat disorganized in the very beginning and then everything seems to fall in place.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said his network has rejected some of its assigned hotel rooms because they are not close enough for key personnel. Some disputes were inevitable because some of the convention hotels are located in the suburbs. Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who has worked on six previous political conventions, said the situation was made worse when organizers started making assignments much too late. Overbooking can be expected, she said, leading to a last-minute scramble for canceled rooms. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s case, she said, `` They're going to have chaos. And if maintenance workers strike the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Towers, as threatened in a long labor dispute, delegates from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> will be looking for new rooms. Convention spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said hotel managers were told in an April letter it would be July 11 before housing plans could be finalized. She said only three of 107 managers responded with questions about the arrangements. But one hotel manager who asked not to be named said, `` I ca n't even get the Democrats to return a phone call I've been calling them for a week. That tells me that they ca n't tell me anything because they're still confused.'' `` I think it's fair to say we're behind schedule,'' Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` We're in a different situation than <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> -LRB- site of the 1984 convention -RRB-. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> had a lot more downtown hotel rooms. But everybody will get one.'' <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrazik </PERSON>, co-director of media arrangements and facilities and a veteran of three previous conventions, says everything will be ready in time. <PERSON> Podrazik </PERSON> took over in late May, succeeding <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrante </PERSON> who was dismissed after complaints that the media effort was disorganized. `` I was coming in just about when people were giving final answers or close to final answers'' on convention logistics, <PERSON> Podrazik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photographers </ORGANIZATION>' Gallery, said efforts to coordinate coverage have been hampered because of delays in receiving plans for photographers. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who has worked on four previous Democratic conventions in his current position and covered others as a news photographer dating back to 1948, said, `` They're usually hectic, but this is a lot worse than previous ones.''

 Students throwing firebombs and rocks battled riot police Sunday around the Roman Catholic cathedral and started a blaze in a 15-story building after authorities blocked a march. Brief running clashes broke out around <LOCATION> Myongdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION> as hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black helmets stopped students from marching in the streets. Firebombs hurled by students at police started the blaze in the ground floor of an office building. Smoke poured from two floors as firefighters and police extinguished the blaze, which apparently was started by accident. The building had been closed and there were no reports of injuries from the blaze. Police officers said offices on the ground floor were damaged. A number of students and police officers were hurt in the fighting, but there were no figures on injuries or arrests. Radicals called for a major rally and march at the cathedral to mark nationwide riots in June 1987 and press for the overthrow of the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. But hundreds of police stopped many students from reaching the cathedral. Only about 200 got through. The students at the cathedral stormed out to break police lines so others could get through, but they were driven back by tear gas. Radicals use the cathedral as a sanctuary because police do not enter for fear of offending public opinion and church authorities. Student leaders, addressing the rally in the cathedral grounds, denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> as dictators. Speakers demanded <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be punished for the bloody suppression in 1980 of an anti-government revolt in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which at least 191 people were killed. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>!'' students shouted. Protesters also chanted `` Yankee go home!'' and speakers charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped suppress the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> revolt and backed military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radical groups had called on people to show support for the protest by honking car horns and joining the rally, but there were no signs of public support. The radicals are a small minority, and few <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> support their demands for reunification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from the South. The students, some armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks, started to march out of the cathedral compound. Protesters leading the march hurled firebombs at police blocking surrounding streets. Riot police tossed tear gas grenades and rifle squads fired volleys of tear gas to drive back the attacking students. Priests used the cathedral's public address system to appeal to students to stop fighting and police to stop firing tear gas. Both sides ignored the appeals. Fighting stopped later as flames and smoke poured from the building hit by firebombs.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the early 1970s, then-Gov. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> firmly defended a work furlough program for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison inmates that was similar to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has attacked recently. And just as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today faces political criticism for violent crimes committed by inmates on work furloughs, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also faced complaints from conservative politicians and police officials that his policies had put dangerous criminals on the streets. Like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the expected <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for president, who continued a work furlough program started under a governor of the opposite party, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inherited his furlough program from Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> implemented <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s program vigorously and boasted that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had one of the most progressive inmate rehabilitation programs in the nation and that he was reducing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s prison population while other states were struggling with prison overcrowding. But after two inmates were charged with murders committed while on work furlough passes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired one top manager of the program and closed one of five work furlough centers. At one point, conservative legislators were demanding the resignation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s director of prisons, and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> chief of police, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who is now a Republican state senator, complained to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` about 40 percent of our serious and violent offenders are on active parole from your <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> resisted the demands to fire his director of prisons and stood behind the furlough program, which still operates today under slightly more restrictive rules. In addition to the work furlough program, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also administered a probation subsidy program under which counties were paid a $ 2,000 annual bonus for each convicted felon who would otherwise go to state prison who they instead placed in a county jail or community rehabilitation program. As a result of the two programs, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became the only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor in modern times to have the prison population decline during his tenure. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, information officer for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, inmates with clean records in prison were eligible for work furlough, even if they had committed violent crimes such as murder. Today's work furlough rules exclude inmates convicted of murder and other violent crimes. But the two work furlough cases which resulted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> murders in the early 1970s both involved inmates with no history of violence _ a burglar and a forger. The burglar's case came first and attracted the most attention because he killed a police officer. But the forger's case three months later, although receiving only minimal public attention, triggered a shake-up of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> program. Two days after the first murder by a work furlough inmate, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vigorously defended the program during a general news conference, saying that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was `` leading the nation in rehabilitation,'' but that `` obviously you ca n't be perfect.'' `` More than 20,000 already have these passes ... and this was the only case of this kind, the only murder,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The first murder was on Oct. 25, 1971, when officer <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> stopped <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenenstahl </PERSON>, who was driving a reported stolen car in the exclusive <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> attempted to handcuff <PERSON> Brenenstahl </PERSON>, the suspect wrestled the officer's gun away from him and shot him. <PERSON> Brenenstahl </PERSON>, who had been sentenced to state prison three years earlier for burglary, was on a 72-hour work furlough at the time and had just obtained a job as a machinist which would have qualified him for early release from prison. <PERSON> Brenenstahl </PERSON> was later convicted of second-degree murder for <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>'s death and sent back to state prison. He was paroled in 1981. The second murder occurred on Jan. 21, 1972, when <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, were accosted outside their <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> apartment by a gunman in a robbery attempt. When <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> resisted, the robber shot him once in the heart and fled. The gunman was later identified as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, a convicted forger on a work furlough.

<HEAD>Pentagon Doesn't Expect Immediate Slowdown in Contract Awards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defense industry fears that the investigation of fraud and bribery in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting will cause a slowdown in contract awards and new layers of oversight, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says it does n't expect that fallout any time soon. `` We are at least weeks, if not months, away from the kind of evidence which would point to looking at the acquisition process -LRB- for an overhaul -RRB-,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman. In the meantime, the process of awarding contracts `` has not ground to a halt,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` It could n't if we continue to stay in business.'' However, industry officials were nearly unanimous in their concern about the impact of the probe. The investigation `` is very bad news for all of us because of the effect it's going to have on the reputation of the industry in total, and because of the stimulus it will provide for additional regulations and oversight,'' <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said last week. `` We'll get regulations and stipulations on what consultants may do,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, manager of media relations for <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Most people believe the procurement process will probably slow down a bit because of new people being moved into some of the positions -LRB- at the Pentagon -RRB- The whole process,'' <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> said, `` will just be a more cautious process.'' Several companies are also worried that existing contracts will be canceled because of evidence of wrongdoing and `` they may have to rebid projects already under way,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetu </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, meanwhile, said Sunday that an earlier study of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting found that contractors already are overaudited and often do n't have the opportunity to make adequate profits. And he expressed a fear that the scandal could lead to cuts in defense spending. `` I certainly hope that this is not used as an excuse by the professional <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bashers for cutting out enough funding for the defense of this nation,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' The investigation of defense fraud, started by the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> nearly two years ago and now directed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, surfaced on June 14 when <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents served more than three dozen search warrants around the country. The warrants named some of the nation's largest defense contractors along with industry consultants and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers. Among the most prominent of the consultants was <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who until April 1987 was an assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say the inquiry centers on allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> executives took bribes from private military consultants who were selling classified contract information to their corporate clients. To date, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s only official response to the investigation has been to reassign six officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to other jobs pending the outcome of the investigation. The reassignments, including a man holding the fairly high-ranking position of deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, are not of sufficient number to create important gaps in the procurement bureaucracy, the services said last week. `` We just do n't foresee any type of impact on the award of contracts because of these moves,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mescus </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and other officials say the scandal is simply too young to directly affect the awarding of contracts. With about 60,000 contracts being awarded every work day _ 15.3 million contracts totaling $ 156.5 billion were distributed in fiscal 1987 _ there is a momentum that is not easily arrested, they said. `` This is a massive organization,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` It has 50,000 people writing contracts or involved in the contractual process.'' Another Pentagon executive agreed: `` There's no impact on awards. You ca n't stop buying F-A-18s when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> needs F-A-18s for its carriers. It does n't work that way.'' Industry officials counter that if they are premature with their fears, the handwriting is on the wall. Indeed, many say they are so concerned that they do n't want to talk about the scandal for fear of fanning publicity. One executive, demanding anonymity, explained: `` Here I am, staring at more competition to begin with because the defense budget is being cut; facing reduced -LRB- profit -RRB- margins because of regulatory changes, and you want me to talk about a probe that is spreading the impression the entire defense industry is crooked. No thanks.'' Underscoring the pressures being produced by the investigation, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee flirted briefly last Friday with legislation that would have allowed the government to suspend payments to defense contractors under investigation in the case. The committee decided such action would be premature, but there were predictions the matter would arise again on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor.

<HEAD>Kabul Airport Fire Destroys Eight Soviet Jet Fighters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western sources said Sunday that a fire at the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> destroyed eight Soviet jet fighters and may have been the result of an attack by Moslem guerrillas. The diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said reports coming in late Saturday said eight Soviet Su-25 jet fighters exploded one after the other at the northwest end of the airport. A telex report from one Western embassy called it `` one of the largest Soviet air losses in the war.'' The sources said their counterparts in the Afghan capital first heard of the fire Friday morning. The explosions and tracer-like eruptions indicated the fire also set off some ammunition, they said. `` It looks like a -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- attack,'' said one Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. He said reliable sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported seeing two incoming rockets, likely fired by insurgents, hit Theo Oga Airport about two hours after the fire was first noticed. Diplomats said the Saturday reports indicated the Soviet planes were parked almost two miles away from where the rounds hit Friday. Soviet and Afghan government forces were fighting U.S.-backed guerrillas just west of the airport, on the northern outskirts of the capital, diplomats said. The fire has shut down activities at the airport, the sources said. They said no fixed-wing aircraft have been seen landing there since the fire began, and that one Soviet Il-76 transport plane was seen being diverted on approach. However, at least one commercial flight of the Afghan airline <PERSON> Ariana </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday, passengers said. Civil and military planes use the same runways at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> but it was not immediately known how many Ariana planes are using the airport. Earlier reports had described heavy military traffic at the airport as Soviets stepped up the resupply of Afghan government troops when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> started its nine-month withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in its war with Afghan rebels. They began withdrawing under an accord signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Guerrillas claimed to have launched rocket attacks on the airport last week but not on Friday. In another development, Afghan and diplomatic sources reported rebels shot down an Afghan transport plane on June 16 near the embattled eastern garrison town of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources said Afghans put the casualty toll at 30 to 40 but were not able to confirm whether all the victims were military. The sources said the incident has reduced the number of nighttime flights into <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>. The flights have been the only means to resupply the garrison, which is surrounded by guerrillas near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Guerrillas have taken dozens of communist posts in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since Soviet and Afghan government troops began redeploying after the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord. Under the agreement, the Soviets began the nine-month withdrawal on schedule on May 15. The Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government said only Soviet troops, not Soviet military advisers, will leave.

 Police on Sunday used sticks to break up a march by women protesting a decree that made Islam the supreme law of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a witness said. The witness said that in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>, police confronted about 150 women demonstrating against the law, which President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> put into effect June 15 in a televised address to the nation. The witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police lashed out with batons. The decree makes Islam `` the supreme law of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' but it will not affect the rights of non-Moslems or the country's business contracts with other nations, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said. The women said they feared the measure would negate Moslem laws introduced in 1961, which acknowledge a woman's right to divorce as well as to demand the registration of marriages and divorces. Witnesses said the protesters, who later held a sit-in, also condemned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for suporting `` the dictator of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' Police arrested six of the protesters. On May 29, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who is also army chief of staff, fired his entire civilian government and dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. He charged the elected ruling bodies with failure to implement the Islam codes. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days, but he has n't set a date. In the southern port city of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, the head of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, warned the president against postponing elections `` This time you -LRB- Zia -RRB- can not escape elections,'' <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said in front of a rally of thousands. In 1979, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ordered the hanging of former prime minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON>'s father, after overthrowing him in a 1977 military coup.

 Farmhand <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> toils for minimum wage on a cotton and soybean farm, scraping by during the searing drought in a tin-roofed sharecropper's house that has no running water and not even an outhouse. `` It's hot enough out there to make a man quit,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 41, on the fifth straight day of 100-plus-degree temperatures in the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> delta. `` You do n't want to go out in the heat. But when it's time to go to work, I'll be there,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said Saturday. `` We survive the best we can in this county down here. Ca n't do nothing but survive.'' The worst drought in 50 years, coupled with a combination punch of record high temperatures, hits everyone in <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of the poorest areas in the country. The heat always seems the hottest for those at the bottom of the bottom, but they shrug it off. `` I was raised in the hot weather,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, the son of a sharecropper who also was the son of a sharecropper. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> earns $ 3.35 an hour to work a sweat-soaked, 12-hour shift that begins at 7 a.m. daily. Although sharecropping has virtually vanished, some of the shabby shanties remain. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> lives with his wife and 6-year-old daughter in an unpainted wooden shack consisting of two rooms, a kitchen and a bedroom. Flattened cardboard boxes serve as wallpaper. The toilet is a bucket or a space behind a barn. Water is hauled from town a mile away. The family pays no rent but has to pay the electric bill. The house has one fan; air conditioning is a fantasy. Nothing is insulated, and the paneless windows have screens patched together with tape. On a rare day off Saturday, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> sharpened tools and tinkered with his truck in the front yard, which adjoins a cotton field. The farm he works, which he calls a plantation, is irrigated and has weathered the hot, dry spell so far. `` It got so dry, the boss was laying off. I guess he felt sorry for us,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, listening to the blues on his pickup's radio In northern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, clay soil that should be as black as buckshot pellets looks white because the moisture's been baked out of it. Dust clouds rise behind tractors like smoke from a fire, then settles on long, straight rows of crops struggling to survive on lands as flat as a tabletop. At the end of a dusty dirt road in the middle of a cotton field outside of <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jerlean </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> hung a load of laundry in the wilting midday sun. `` It's too hot for anything,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 35. `` Everything's drying up. I know it's affecting the farmers. I could n't even raise a garden. It burned up.'' The hum of three electric fans droned from the old sharecropper's house, consisting of three bedrooms and a kitchen topped by corrugated tin. It has no running water and no toilet. Plastic sheets make do as window panes. Mrs. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' 16-year-old daughter, also named <PERSON> Jerlean </PERSON>, worked three days last week and four days the week before as a cotton chopper. The job is as unglamorous as it sounds. For 10 hours a day at the minimum wage, laborers chop weeds with hoes along cotton rows. `` It's the only kind of work we can find to do,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. `` It's the only way to make a living when you ai n't got no job. Jobs is hard to find.'' About 200 hands work as choppers in <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where cotton is still king but the per capita wage is $ 6,800, about 30 percent lower than average in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. But the dry weather even puts a crimp in that grueling endeavor. `` It's so hot and dry, the weeds are n't growing,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON>, a farmer who laid off 15 choppers on Friday because he did n't need them anymore Cotton farmers kill weeds with chemicals. But unless rain falls, the chemicals do n't do their job. `` It's been so dry, chemicals do n't work very well. Choppers get the escape weeds,'' said county agent <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. `` It's not glamorous work,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. `` I did it for a while. It did n't take me long to figure out I did n't want to do that the rest of my life.'' Five miles down the road from <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION>, at a crossroads near a granary, sits <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>. It's the home of the <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R One-Stop, a gas station, grocery store, beer garden, pool hall and sandwich shop under a shingled roof. Sweaty men sat outside on a wooden bench in the unpaved parking lot, where an outdoor thermometer read 110 degrees in the shade. `` Everything's burning up,'' said a farmhand who identified himself as Rock, sipping an icy drink after working the fields until noon. `` It's hot as hell. If it do n't rain, there ai n't going to be nothing for nobody to do. Right now, it's rough. All we can do is look to the Lord.''

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Research on Medicare, Medicaid Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is making decisions about the $ 120 billion-a-year <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid programs on the basis of federal research that is often delayed or of poor quality, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was producing reports that `` were often not fully responsive to congressional needs, were frequently late and were variable in their technical adequacy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> attributed some of the problems to the lengthy review and revision process conducted by administration policy makers both inside and outside the health field. More than 45 million elderly, disabled and poor Americans rely on Medicare and Medicaid to pay for their health services. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> oversees the two programs. The financing administration also conducts research at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the president when cutbacks or changes are being contemplated, to determine their impact on health care. Recent studies, for example, have examined the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> prospective payment system for hospitals and state regulations on Medigap policies that insure people for services uncovered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on human resources, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report raises serious questions about how important decisions affecting health care are made. `` If policies are made on the basis of inadequate or misleading information, or if the information needed is not provided on time, then we can expect health care to deteriorate,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who requested the report, said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said concerns about the quality of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> research had been expressed since 1980 by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, congressional agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and others. It said quality had not improved much in the last eight years. Part of the reason, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, was that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was mandating more and more studies while the administration was reducing the health care agency's staff and resources. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> studied three areas and made the following comments: _ Relevance The office said that reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suffered from a combination of vague mandates, lack of formal communications between lawmakers and researchers, and administration reviewers who deleted relevant information on the basis of policy considerations. _ Timeliness The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found that of 28 reports due before the summer of 1986, 26 were delivered late or were still overdue. The lateness was attributed primarily to a review-revision cycle involving officials at the health care financing agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of Management and Budget. Reviews `` often have lasted for months or even years,'' the agency said. _ Technical quality of research More than one-third of the projects awarded by the health care financing agency in one year were disapproved by review panels on the basis of technical inadequacy, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found. This was blamed on a flawed award process and a finding that `` a technical perspective did not always dominate reviews'' by the health care financing agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of Management and Budget. The deputy administrator of the health care financing agency, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackbarth </PERSON>, denied that his agency has been improperly influenced by policy considerations. `` Obviously, on policy issues, we do have a policy perspective that we advocate. I do n't think that's unfair,'' he said. `` I do not think there are instances where we have tried to mislead <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by deleting relevant, factual, technical information.'' <PERSON> Hackbarth </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, rather than the review process, is to blame for tardy reports. He said lawmakers require long lists of studies without considering the money or staff available to do them. `` It should be no surprise to anyone that there are more studies than there are resources and the end result is late reports,'' he said. <PERSON> Hackbarth </PERSON> admitted that his agency has sometimes awarded grant money to projects that are technically weak, but said it has been done when the agency had virtually no alternative. `` We can either not do any research on a pressing problem or we can decide to go ahead with a proposal that is not technically everything we would like it to be,'' he said. `` Sometimes we do the latter and I think it is entirely defensible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report recommended a number of steps it believes the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> should take, among them an assessment of whether health care financing agency has enough staff and resources to handle the reports mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and sought by the administration. It also said the department should develop a formalized review process to ensure timely delivery of reports, and make sure there is better communication between researchers and lawmakers.

 An Airbus A320 jetliner carrying 127 people crashed into a forest during an air show in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, killing at least two people and injuring more than 80 others, officials said. Rescue workers said 10 to 25 people were trapped inside the battered fuselage, which tore a nearly 500-foot-long path through a forest at the end of an airport runway, Agence France-Presse reported. District government officials said two of the 82 injured people were seriously hurt. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was making a demonstration flight at an air show, and many of its passengers were making their first flight, district government officials said. The plane's wings were broken and the cockpit windows smashed. The fuselage was blackened from smoke and was covered with white foam that firefighters were using to prevent a fire, <ORGANIZATION> AFP </ORGANIZATION> said. The air show, which was expected to attract 30,000 people, was held at <LOCATION> Habsheim </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Habsheim </LOCATION>, a village of 3,600, government officials said. It is about 15 miles from the international airport of Mulhouse-Bale near the Swiss border. The twin-engine Airbus A320 is a new model that went into service in April for <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the accident occurred at 2:50 p.m. -LRB- 8:50 a.m. EDT -RRB- while the plane was flying at a low altitude near the Habsheim airport. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Witnesses said the aircraft struck some trees at the end of a runway. `` It was about 20 meters -LRB- 65 feet -RRB- above the ground with its flaps and landing gear down when it clipped some trees at the end of the runway and crashed in the forest,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Labalette </PERSON>, an amateur pilot who was near the scene of the crash, was quoted by AFP as saying. Other witnesses said they heard a series of explosions after the crash. <PERSON> Labalette </PERSON> was quoted as saying that rescue workers had a difficult time reaching the scene of the accident because it was in the middle of a forest. A 25-year-old woman passenger who did not give her name was quoted by AFP as saying she heard trees brush against the fuselage after the aircraft flew over the airport. `` From then on things went fast,'' she said. `` The plane hit the ground hard and we had the feeling of an abrupt jolt. Then there was a fire in the front of the aircraft.'' Flight attendants deployed evacuation chutes and the woman said she and other passengers slid down them and ran from the aircraft because they feared an explosion. According to the officials in the government office, who are not named under French practice, the pilot, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Asseline </PERSON>, and the co-pilot survived the crash `` shaken up but not injured.'' The Airbus A320 can carry 168 passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, its manufacturer, has 500 orders to purchase the craft. According to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> officials, the plane was delivered to <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> last Thursday. `` We are disturbed, shocked and saddened,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> press spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alizart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION>, where the aircraft is manufactured. He said a team of experts from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> would be sent to the site to determine the cause of the crash. He said it was too early to say whether the future of the aircraft could be put in doubt. The plane, built by a European consortium led by its French and German partners, received its certification Feb. 26. It is the first aircraft equipped with electronic flight system and controls that are beside the pilot instead of in front of him. It consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar two or three engine jets it is designed to replace.

 The Communist Party conference opening Tuesday could play a role in changing the nature of the party and making it more responsive to the people than it has been since it came to power in 1917. Proposals to be discussed at the 19th All-Union Party Conference could, if accepted by delegates, limit the power of the 20-million-member organization and that of its general secretary and chief reformer, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` It is high time party workers stopped doing the work of economic managers and stopped interfering in day-to-day production activity,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party workers in October. Instead, he said, the party should focus on politics and ideology. The party has been searching its soul since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched his `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, program in April 1985. The results are proposals that sociologist and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> has said would have caused `` mass shock'' three years ago. The conference is expected to examine the possible reforms, called `` theses,'' that could shift the party's focus _ from running the day-to-day Soviet economy and bureaucracy to a more purely political role of winning the people's hearts and minds. The reforms are aimed at eliminating the heavy-handed, centralized administration introduced by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the 1920s and at dismantling the `` cult of personality'' associated with almost every Soviet leader since then. If conference members support the suggested legal reforms, their party would be more open to the people than it has been since taking power in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Many of the new theses are designed to revive the days when <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilyich </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> led the revolution and created a Communist Party that set general policy and left day-to-day affairs to a network of soviets, or local governing councils. Today's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> does much more _ it administers the government, fills bureaucratic posts and tells workers what to do. Since <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> instituted five-year economic plans in 1928, party officials have set production quotas and pressured everyone, from government ministers to factory and farm managers, to meet them. The proposed theses say the party's new assignment is to `` work out a theory and strategy of social development, domestic and foreign policy and the ideology of socialist rejuvenation.'' Theses to be examined at the conference include: _ Encouraging freer debates at party meetings, where the party leader now speaks first and delegates rarely offer criticisms or suggestions of their own _ Tightening party membership requirements to draw only `` really worthy people with superior political, moral and business qualities,'' and reviewing all 20 million members Sociologist <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> has complained the proposal does n't make clear who is to conduct this review, and warns of possible abuses. _ Expansion of multi-candidate elections, conducted by secret ballot, for officials to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Another proposal is designed to make officials more accountable for their work by limiting party officials to two, five-year terms, and legislators to one, five-year term. The new proposal could limit the term of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself, as the party's general secretary. The limit on terms is bound to anger officials who spent years accumulating power and privilege. In 1961, the late premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> persuaded the party to pass a similar rule, and it contributed to his ouster three years later. The rule was later revoked.

 The League of Women Voters is starting a nationwide postcard-writing campaign to try to get the 1988 presidential candidates to agree to debate under its sponsorship. Two postcards, one addressed to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and one to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, are being sent to league members with an accompanying letter from <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, chairwoman of the group's education fund `` The shameless attempt by the two parties to ` steal' the debates threatens more than the league,'' the letter said. `` It threatens the voters.'' The postcards urge the two likely nominees to commit to the league's general election debates. The league is asking its members to mail the postcards to the two candidates. The group has sponsored presidential debates since 1976, but this year has been fighting with the Democratic and Republican parties which are holding their own debates. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman, said, `` We will wait and see what the two parties decide. We are not closing any options.'' `` I know we are committed to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> debates,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman. `` At this point that is all we have committed to.'' Both the league and the parties are proposing three debates for the presidential candidates and one for the vice presidential candidates. The league has announced debates in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> The parties announced debates in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md.; <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.; and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

 `` Meese is a Pig,'' a slogan first plastered on construction fences, building walls and traffic signal boxes in the nation's capital, has turned into a thriving enterprise that ca n't keep up with demand. T-shirts calling for the ouster of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> are the hottest-selling item ever stocked by Common Concerns, a downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bookstore, manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcuse </PERSON> says. He estimated that about 1,000 of them have been sold so far. The T-shirts are produced by a group of about 60 punk rock musicians and fans, who say they got into the business after they were arrested for putting up posters with the `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is a Pig'' slogan in places where no posting is allowed. Group members say they decided to sell T-shirts to get out their message in another way and to raise money to cover their legal expenses. `` We were n't intending to become a T-shirt fashion fad,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, spokesman for the group. To date, only one member of the group is making the shirts, and <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said that `` he goes to sleep, gets up and makes T-shirts, goes to sleep, gets up and makes T-shirts.'' The business got some free publicity last week after a bicycle messenger reported that he had not been admitted into the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because he was wearing the shirt. But by the end of the week, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it would allow people wearing the shirt inside the building. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said in an interview this weekend that the department does n't take the T-shirts too seriously. `` I know it's hard to believe, but we spend 13, 14 hours a day thinking about serious matters involving law enforcement,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its troops Sunday drove out the last Iranian occupiers from its southern Howeizah marshes. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used poison gas in the battle and in another attack, killing 60 people and injuring 4,000. The marshes were held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since 1984 and were <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s last foothold in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s third major land victory since April in the nearly 8-year-old war, and President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was quoted as calling it `` the last of the difficult battles'' and predicting `` final victory soon.'' <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officers who took part in an assault Saturday said paratroopers were dropped behind Iranian lines to cut them off while ground forces moved eastward. The Iraqi 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, spearheaded by units of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, drove the Iranians back across the border and pursued them into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted a military communique as saying the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces withdrew into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Sunday. Fighting still raged Sunday in the marshes east of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. But by all accounts the main battle was over. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, acknowledged that Iraqis had `` gained control'' of the Majnoon islands in the swamplands and pushed its forces out of the Majnoon sector. But it charged the Iraqis seized the islands through `` extensive use of chemical weapons to force <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s combatants to retreat.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes also dropped bombs containing nerve, cyanide and mustard gases Saturday near the southwestern oil city of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of the marshes, killing 60 people and injuring 4,000. The Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified `` authoritative source'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as denying chemicals weapons were used. Iraqi military communiques Saturday said fighter-bombers attacked military targets southwest of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION> to prevent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from moving up troops to reinforce its beleaguered Majnoon garrison. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has repeatedly accused Iraqi of using chemical weapons in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Chemical weapons were outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> treaty. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed its anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi jet Saturday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied losing any planes. The Iraqis, displaying a new aggressiveness after six years of defensive warfare, recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on April 18 and drove the Iranians out of a bridgehead east of the port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on May 25. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian fighter-bombers attacked <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troop concentrations and strongpoints around <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> on Sunday, `` inflicting heavy casualties and losses.'' The Iraqi agency said that the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> launched a secondary offensive in the Howeizah sector Sunday, mopping up pockets of Iranian resistance and overrunning `` sand embankments'' built by the Iranians as a last line of defense near the border. The new push `` ended the enemy presence'' in the region, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> agency quoted a military communique as saying. The Iraqis claimed `` large numbers'' of Iranians were killed or wounded in the Majnoon fighting, with more than 2,000 captured along with `` big quantities'' of weapons and other equipment. The loss of the Majnoon islands, a network of sandy islets linked by earthen causeways and pontoon bridges in the 1,000-square-mile marshes, means <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s only bridgehead remaining in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is territory <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seized in the northern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains in recent months. Western military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Iraqis heavily outnumbered the Iranian defenders in <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION>.

 Democrats headed home early Sunday after producing the party's shortest platform in decades in a spirit of harmony that left <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s forces talking unity and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign satisfied there was nothing in the document to embarrass the likely nominee The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up work in a marathon session Saturday night on a party blueprint for what it calls `` The Restoration of Competence and Hope.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s delegates easily turned aside <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> efforts to add planks that would have committed the Democrats to raise taxes on the wealthy, freeze the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, double education spending, commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and call for Palestinian self-determination. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform chief, said Sunday no decisions had been made on which if any of the issues <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will fight for on the floor of next month's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself must make that decision, taking into account not only gains he made on both the party's platform and rules for 1992, but `` how he sees his own future politically.'' As it stands, the broad-brush, moderate platform makes no dollars-and-cents promises, but vows the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will `` restore competence, caring and incorruptibility'' to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and `` reverse seven years of ` voodoo economics,' ` trickle down' policies and fiscal irresponsibility. `` There's nothing in the document with which he disagrees,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues director <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edley </PERSON>, who observed that on issues such as acid rain, health care and defense the platform is less specific than the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has been. But if the entire platform was tailored to suit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, many passages also bore <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stamp, from its call for an indexed minimum wage to its declaration that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a terrorist state to a slap at corporate raiders and to a commitment to same-day and mail-in voter registration. `` Although we have differences ... about 95 percent of all the issues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolved in a peaceful and in a unified way, and I know that scares the Republicans to death,'' former <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said late Saturday shortly before the panel finished its work. It was <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> who offered the first minority amendment Saturday: a shotgun <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budget plan that would have raised the tax rate on 600,000 upper-income Americans from 28 to 50 percent and frozen the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for five years. It went down, 108-44, in the only stand-up vote the committee took. The committee handled without rancor nearly a score of other amendments by voice votes, rejecting some key <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stands but accepting others, including ones calling for Third World debt relief and significant increases in child care aid for low - and middle-income families <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the party chairman, exulted that the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had followed his instructions to avoid `` a litany of social, cultural or ideological buzzwords.'' `` Common sense politics has given us a short statement of principle all Democrats can run on in November,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman who led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s platform team, told reporters that in working on the past four party platforms, `` I have never seen a situation that was anywhere near this united. He said it showed `` the Democratic party really has matured and is ready to take the reins of government.'' `` There may be in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> some further discussion of these issues,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> predicted. `` That's normal. But I'm confident that if there is, it will be done in the same spirit we saw here in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost on the centerpiece of his campaign, the budget plan for tax hikes and a military freeze, but won on the second most important issue: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. She said some of the issues it lost on were `` important but not central'' to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign, but she declined to be specific. In weighing floor fights, she said, `` We ought to look at the effect it will have on the convention itself. Will it be divisive for no important reason? Is it worth the trade-off in divisiveness? ... -LRB- Does -RRB- the issue need the open and visible support of a convention or ... would it only be icing? `` There have indeed been significant differences between <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during this campaign,'' she said. `` Those did not evaporate at <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. What did happen, however, is that the governor and the reverend in these proceedings moved closer together.'' The committee staff was still working Sunday to finalize the language of the amended platform, which will not be final until approved by the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on July 19. But it was expected to run around 4,000 words _ a tenth the size of the 1980 and 1984 platforms and the shortest since the terse platforms that <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> ran on in 1932 and 1936.

<HEAD>Police Search For Clues In Singleton Home Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police were scrutinizing remnants of a crude homemade bomb tossed at the home of rapist <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s brother, but had no idea Sunday who hurled the explosive in a normally quiet <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> suburb <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON>, were alone in their house when the bomb exploded Saturday night in their front yard, about 30 feet from the front door, said <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> They were uninjured. Bomb squad experts were looking for fingerprints and other clues Sunday on bomb bits picked out of the lawn, she said. `` Our bomb squad has the fragments that are left; we think it was a homemade device,'' she said. `` We found pieces of cardboard and duct tape. We're processing them so hopefully we'll be able to tell something from that.''' There were no arrests by midday Sunday, and no one saw the bomb tossed. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker, chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead in a ditch southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1978. The girl survived. A 60-year-old former merchant seaman who grew up in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison. He completed a year-long probation and is now free to live where he pleases. During his probation, he was forced to live in a trailer on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison grounds because of bitter protest in several communities that were proposed as homes for him. The blast left an impression about four feet across in the yard, but no damage to the house that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> listed with state officials as his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> address, said sheriff's Maj. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. `` At first we thought it was a lightning bolt, then we looked out of our window and saw smoke,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Harrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>. Neighbors happened to see a red vehicle in the area, but authorities do n't know if it was the same one from which the bomb was hurled, Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Since <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> registered his brother's address with the state, neighbors have been frightened and upset. A local businessman and a radio station have each offered <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> $ 5,000 if he will pack up and go anywhere else. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> says his brother lives `` about two hours away'' from here, but refuses to say exactly where. Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said it was unclear if the bombing would further upset residents of the <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` It's too early to tell if this is going to add fuel to the fire, so to speak,'' she said. `` We have patrols in the area that make periodic checks on Mr. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s home.''

<HEAD>Politicians Bring Rare Criminal Libel Charges Against Newspaper

<TEXT>
 Two years ago, an editor besieged by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>' letters to his newspaper suggested that the retired agriculture teacher start up his own publication to voice his opinions. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> took the advice, and today his fledgling weekly is in the midst of a legal battle involving First Amendment rights. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, the 62-year-old editor of <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, not only stirred up the political powers that be in this poor, rural county of some 40,000 people. His denunciation of two politicians and subsequent arrest on criminal libel charges caught the attention of journalists around the country. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> has gone to jail once and could go again for expressing his opinion in a newspaper. He awaits word Monday on whether he has been indicted by a <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury on criminal libel charges. If indicted and convicted, he faces a fine of up to $ 5,000 and a year in jail. `` Clearly, we've got a political commentator making a political statement about two politicians,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirtley </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It seems to me that punishing someone for speaking is not an American concept.'' But <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>' targets see something more in the caustic column he wrote before the June 14 primary elections. State Rep. <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON> say <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>' attacks, in which he accuses them of stealing and corruption without offering evidence, are lying, hurtful shots that deserve to be punished `` Freedom of the press is not to go around with freedom and accuse people of committing crimes,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. The two politicians have brought what is believed to be only the fourth criminal libel suit in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 40 years, and the first in the nation since 1984. Although civil libel cases are not unusual and often result in the awarding of monetary damages to the aggrieved party, criminal libel cases are rare because they can send a journalist to jail. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, who spent 13 years as an agriculture teacher in <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and 20 years as <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s agricultural extension agent in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, retired in 1986 and began sending letters to the county's only newspaper over a controversial school board issue After a while, he said, the editor suggested <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> needed his own paper to publish his opinions. `` I said, ` That's a good idea; I had n't thought about that,''' he recalled in an interview Thursday. Roughly six months later, in January 1987, a new weekly began rolling off the presses, and from the beginning it expressed <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>' outspoken style `` I've always been opinionated,'' he said. `` I just have an opinion and I have no problem sharing it.'' He may have a problem sharing it for a while, however. The judge who set his bond also put him under a gag order forbidding him to discuss his arrest. He spent a weekend in jail under $ 40,000 bond before he was released on his own recognizance. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> think <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> crossed the line with a May 17 column, in which he wrote: `` I will say to you, without fear of contradiction, if every black in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would start stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives, they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their time in power.'' The column gave no specifics, and when asked what he thought they had stolen, he said only that they had taken the pride of people of <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He stressed that he was not apologizing for what he wrote but acknowledged that he could have chosen his words better. `` I'm not trained as a journalist. I do n't know how to polish things,'' he said. `` Maybe if I had polished it, I could have gotten it across better.'' <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, who is black, has said that the dispute with the two politicians is economic, not racial. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> is black and <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> is white. The Voice, with a circulation of 2,300, has a largely black readership. Despite what people like <PERSON> Kirtley </PERSON> say, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer said the criminal libel law is still a good one. `` I do n't think the press has been fair in the matter,'' said attorney <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>. `` I can understand ... they want to protect themselves. `` There is a statute in this state against libel and slander. They -LRB- the media -RRB- say that it's antiquated, but as long as it's a law, it ought to be obeyed,'' <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said. `` Also, if it's antiquated, the Ten Commandments are antiquated, because they were written 5,000 years ago and it says ` Thou shalt not bear false witness,''' he said.

<HEAD>Most Children Entering Chicago Public Schools Lack Basic Skills,
Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Half the children who enter the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public school system are unable to say their first and last names or to speak in complete simple sentences, a new survey of kindergarten teachers indicates. Also, most of the youngsters are also unable to identify basic shapes such as squares and circles, hold a pencil or crayon correctly, sit still to listen to a brief story, or settle disputes without physical aggression, the survey found. The findings, published Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, resulted from a poll in late May by the newspaper indicating that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s public schools are overwhelmed with many low-income children who start kindergarten unprepared for basic classroom learning. `` The sad thing is, these kids are not only illiterate _ they're incompetent,'' said philanthropist <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who has sponsored innovative pre-school programs for families at the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> public housing project `` There's a difference,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to be literate to have common sense sense and be able to do things.'' The newspaper also surveyed kindergarten teachers in the affluent suburb of <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION>, where the vast majority of children entering their classes could perform all of the basic tasks. The survey also found that the overwhelming majority of <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> kindergartners had been read to by their parents and taken to a zoo, library or museum, but most <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> kindergartners had not enjoyed those experiences. Based on estimates given by their teachers, 51 percent of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> kindergartners percent could not tell both their first and last names, compared with only 3 percent in <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION>; 52 percent in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> could not speak in complete sentences, compared with 8 percent in <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION>; and 59 percent in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> could not identify a square, circle and triangle, compared with 18 percent in <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Half to nearly three-fourths of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> kindergartners also could not indentify primary colors, draw a recognizable human figure, or tell a story with a beginning, middle and end. Teachers were asked to give the total number of children they teach and then estimate what percentage could do various things at the beginning of the school year. Chicago Schools Supt. <PERSON> Manford </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the results reflected `` a failed social policy,'' in which the schools are expected to make up for the neglect and lack of support low-income families face. The survey proved that there should be more state support for pre-school programs for children from low-income families, he said. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 74 percent of the pupils in the survey were from low-income families, compared with only 4 percent in <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said it conducted a random sampling May 20 to 26 of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> kindergarten teachers, receiving responses from 196 of the 285 teachers who were sent questionnaires. Those responding teach 7,122 children, or 24 percent of the citywide kindergarten enrollment. Four of the six kindergarten teachers in <LOCATION> Wilmette </LOCATION> responded to the 45-item questionnaire. The newspaper did not estimate a margin of error for the survey.

 The Boy Scouts have rescued this isolated city from the possibility that it would run out of drinking water by the end of a drought-baked summer. A 2-mile-long, 8-inch pipeline, planned to be finished in a few weeks, will link a Boy Scout camp reservoir with an undersized, rundown municipal water system. The Scouts are letting the town have the water for free. `` It gets a little thirsty around here when it does n't rain,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Birket </PERSON>, city water supervisor, said last week. The Scout organization agreed to help last October after the town of about 5,000 in a coastal valley 120 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> declared a state of emergency. Officials expected the city's reservoir to run out by Thanksgiving. A convoy of trucks from a variety of government agencies hauled in pipe loaned by the state. Forklifts from private companies unloaded it. Workers from the state conservation youth corps began clamping it together. All was at no cost to the ranching community in <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Then the rains came, so the pipeline was left unfinished. However, only two-thirds of the normal 50 inches fell, not enough to ward off fears that the city could run dry this summer. Now the city plans to finish the pipeline and begin pumping water before its reservoir is drawn too far down. But some folks think the pipeline should already have been completed in <LOCATION> Willits </LOCATION>, the only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> city that's declared a state of emergency because of the drought. `` People are always talking about it. It's not even finished. It's just sitting out there,'' said <PERSON> Kelli </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a 30-year-old waitress at Mom's Place on Main Street, which is also <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 101. People are n't really worried, though, she added, plunking down glasses of water for two customers who had n't asked for them, in violation of voluntary city conservation rules. She explained, with a shrug, `` It's hot today.'' Water conservation will shift from voluntary to mandatory Friday, city Manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Orden </PERSON> said. People who wash cars or hose driveways can be fined $ 500. Sprinklers also will be shut off at some city parks. `` If you waste water, you have neighbors telling on you,'' he said. Voluntary measures, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Orden </PERSON> said, have cut average daily water usage significantly because `` the city officials asking for cutbacks are residents' next-door neighbors, not people they do n't know _ like in larger cities. `` We're all running around with dirty cars and not watering our yards in the daytime,'' said <PERSON> Elin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, an adult education teacher. The drought has worsened water problems Willits already faced, but the city is working to ensure that the headaches do n't persist. The city has secured $ 3.3 million in state loans to improve its water system and expand its reservoir.

 Soviet Jews demanding the right to emigrate gathered on a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> street Sunday, but within minutes their posters were ripped down and police took away the group's leader. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> and about 10 other Soviet Jews came to the Arbat, a bustling pedestrian mall in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, to protest legislation they say prevents them from leaving the country. Soviet officials say the only bar to emigration is knowledge of state secrets, but <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> and the others said they can not leave because of a law requiring documentation that they do n't owe money to relatives or ex-spouses. A law passed in August 1986 requires that the documentation be provided by would-be emigrants' relatives. <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> said Soviet citizens have no legal way to make a relative provide such information. `` The courts are no help,'' said the former mathematician, who lost his job when he applied to leave the country more than two years ago. `` They have been told not to get involved in cases involving refuseniks. More than 200,000 Soviet Jews want to leave, but ca n't.'' At 4 p.m., <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> and the others, members of a refusenik group called the Poor Relatives, assembled in front of a building on the Arbat. They taped four small posters on the wooden fence that surrounds the building. One read: `` If you want to know the truth about refuseniks, and not the usual lies and filth from the newspapers and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, read the informational leaflet from the ` Poor Relatives' Group.'' Scores of Soviets assembled to scan the posters. Ten minutes after the posters went up, two men dressed in civilian clothes ripped them down, walked away and threw them into the trash. A water truck usually used to hose down Soviet streets passed close to the group clustered around the posters, forcing them closer to the wooden fence. `` It's the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON>. A police lieutenant came up to <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> and asked him to accompany him to a district court. <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> asked if he was being detained. `` I invite you to accompany me because of administrative violations you have committed,'' the policeman said. `` What violations?'' <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> asked. `` You know very well,'' the lieutenant said. <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> refused to go, and the lieutenant left. A few minutes later, four uniformed police officers picked their way through the scores of people who had gathered around the demonstrators and grabbed <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON>. The policemen held the refusenik tightly under the arms as they took him to a small green sedan. He was then driven away. Jewish emigration last month from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached 1,145, its highest monthly total in seven years, but <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> activists say tens of thousands of Soviet Jews have had their applications for an exit visa rejected. <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> has said he can not get an affadavit from his former wife, <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, that attests he does not owe her any money. He said he tried three times to get <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> courts to force her to give him the document but that the courts refused. On Saturday, about 200 people refused to allow police to break up a demonstration on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a recently created group that wants to challenge the political monopoly of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At least three people were detained by police at that protest. Also Saturday, 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> joined former political prisoners and leading Soviet intellectuals at an officially condoned rally in north <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to demand a monument to the victims of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges. Authorities have announced they will take tough measures during the nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, which begins Tuesday, to prevent unauthorized demonstrations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I do n't expect the party conference to deal with the problem of Soviet Jews,'' <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON> said before his arrest. `` They have said they will deal with ethnic relations, but not with our emigration problem.''

 The national <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION>, facing a court battle over a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state chapter's decision to hire a man as a leader, has voted to retain the all-female status it has held for 130 years, its national president said Sunday. But the organization's board of directors postponed a vote on whether to expel the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, chapter for hiring a man as executive director, said President <PERSON> Glendora </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlwain </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON>. The chapter has sued to remain a part of the national organization, which concluded its 31st national convention Sunday at a downtown hotel. At the five-day meeting, an estimated 1,200 delegates from local chapters across the country voted overwhelmingly to continue to exclude men as full voting members, Ms. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. `` It is now more important than ever that the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> remain an autonomous women's membership movement because of the serious challenges which confront women in the areas of employment, housing, child-care and poverty,'' she said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION>'s position is an affirmative response to inequity and disparity which continue to be the rule rather than the exception,'' she said. The Young Women's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was founded in 1858 as an organization exclusively for women, partly to address the problems of housing, poverty-level wages and educational opportunities for young women who flocked to cities during the Industrial Revolution. `` The fundamental focus of our organization has been the same ... the empowerment of women and girls ... making them more in control of their lives,'' Ms. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Under the group's constitution, men can participate as associates, but not as full, voting members. The constitution also says that executive directors should be full, voting members, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. Earlier this year, the <PERSON> Odgen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, chapter became the first in the country to lose its affiliation for allowing men to join as full members. The chapter still has time to reconsider its action before it is barred from using the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> name and logo, Ms. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Although recent court decisions have forced several formerly all-male groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> to admit women, Ms. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said she does not consider the YWCA policy discriminatory. Those earlier court rulings have been aimed at allowing women into places `` where business is discussed,'' she said. `` We're not a marketplace issue. We do n't come to the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> to discuss business,'' Ms. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Rather, the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> offers services aimed solely at women, such as child-care, programs for battered women and fitness classes, she said. `` Women need a place where they can be comfortable expressing their problems, their fears, the way they face the world. They need to discuss it with other women,'' she said. <PERSON> Pene </PERSON> <PERSON> Modahl </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> chapter's board of directors, has said that hiring <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiger </PERSON> as executive director will not hurt that goal. She called him `` the best possible candidate, who happened to be a man.'' The <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> chapter filed suit June 10 in <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to bar the national board from expelling it. Ms. <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said she did not know when the board would vote on whether to expel the chapter, but guessed that it might happen at the next board meeting in October. Tiger, 36, who was hired in May, has vowed that the chapter will retain its commitment to women. `` We have to ask ourselves, when in the women's movement do we stop talking about men and women and start to talk about humanity?'' he said.

 A bomb destroyed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader's car Sunday and killed his two young sons in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Dissident Palestinian guerrillas stormed a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refugee camp in clashes with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s faction. Police said eight people were killed and 14 wounded as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s loyalists and Syrian-backed dissidents of Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> faction fought with mortars and rockets in the <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh By police count, 120 people have been killed and 516 wounded since the power struggle for control of the camps in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts flared May 1 Police said artillery duels raged from dawn to dusk, when the dissidents stormed <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION>, capturing two of their four bases seized by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction a month ago. In the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp outside the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the two sons of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrad </PERSON>, a central committee member of the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, were killed in the car bomb, police reported. They were identified as <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Mazen </PERSON>, 6.

Mossad has been blamed for the assassination in April of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s military commander, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, and for the killings of three of his senior officers in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, in February.

The two groups in a joint statement called on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to `` intervene to put an end to the tragedy of the two camps.'' Among Sunday's victims were two Syrian soldiers killed and another wounded when a stray shell hit a checkpoint they were manning near <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> el-Barajneh, police reported. In the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> camps, witnesses said many residents fled during a lull in fighting Saturday, packing their belongings and seeking safety in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> and other radical factions opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s policies broke away from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in a 1983 Syrian-backed mutiny. But the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> rejoined the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in 1987.

 A moderate earthquake shook a wide area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Sunday, knocking bottles off shelves and startling residents, but there were no reports of serious damage. At least four people were treated for minor injuries. The quake, centered 3 miles north-northwest of here, struck at 8:04 a.m. and registered 4.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lab </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Instruments at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, recorded a slightly higher reading, 4.7. Upland, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, is a city of about 50,000 people located 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It felt really strong, like it was n't going to stop. We've had numerous people calling in,'' said Upland police dispatcher <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jauregui </PERSON>. `` We've had a lot of audible alarms, but no damage.'' The temblor was felt in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and as far away as <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION>, some 70 miles northwest of the epicenter, and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, about 70 miles to the east. It was followed by several aftershocks. Hospitals in Upland and in <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION>, a couple of miles south, reported treating four persons for minor injuries. <ORGANIZATION> Pomona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> had to operate on emergency power for about 2 -RCB- hours when the quake knocked electricity out. `` We have units checking the city for damage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>. `` It jolted pretty good here. We have alarms going off all over.'' She said there no immediate reports of serious damage. There were a few reports of broken windows and cracked stucco. At the <LOCATION> Ramona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> convenience store in <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION>, bottles fell off shelves. A dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said she received 25 to 35 calls from rattled residents, but no reports of damage or injuries. `` It was my first one,'' said the dispatcher, who recently moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and declined to identify herself. `` It was just a pretty big rumble. But nothing dropped down. I was kind of excited that I finally felt one. I've been hearing about them for so long. `` I did get under my desk,'' she said. `` I was a good girl.'' Earlier Sunday morning, a small quake was recorded in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but there were no reports of injury or damage. The state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said the 12:54 a.m. temblor registered 3.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, with an epicenter 7 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> police said no one called about the earthquake and it was not felt at the police station. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake measuring 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage in a populated area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

 Five armed men on Sunday kidnapped a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who was visiting his homeland to give a lecture, but they freed him unharmed 5 -LCB- hours later, police said. Professor <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bultjens </PERSON>, 48, was pushed into a car outside his <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> home by the gunmen and driven away at about 4 p.m., said police, speaking on condition of anonymity. He was released at 9:30 p.m., police said. They declined to say where Bultjens was freed or whether any ransom was demanded or paid. No reason for the episode was given. Police said initially they did not know if the gunmen belonged to a militant group. Later they refused to answer questions. According to a man who answered the telephone at Bultjens' home, the professor was picked up by police after his release and taken to police headquarters for brief questioning. The man, who refused to identify himself, said <PERSON> Bultjens </PERSON> was back in his house about an hour after he was released but did not want to come to the telephone. <PERSON> Bultjens </PERSON> was in his homeland to deliver a lecture in honor of opposition leader <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s late husband, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, who was the prime minister of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in the late 1950s. The lecture was scheduled for 5 p.m. at the <ORGANIZATION> Bandaranaike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>. Police said earlier they were investigating whether Tamil separatists or militant Sinhalese were involved in the abduction. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, are waging a guerrilla war in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> for more autonomy from the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>, who control the government and military. Bultjens is neither a Tamil or a Sinhalese, but a member of the minority `` Burgher'' community, made up of descendants of European colonialists. The professor, a specialist in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> studies, has been teaching at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Urs </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthasar </PERSON>, a prominent Swiss theologian whom Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appointed cardinal four weeks ago, died Sunday, church officials said. He was 82. Bishop <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuest </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, in a brief statement, said that with <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthasar </PERSON>, `` one of the century's greatest theologians,'' passed away. Cause of his death was not immediately announced. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthasar </PERSON> had been scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Monday to be elevated to his new rank along with 24 other newly designated cardinals. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthasar </PERSON> was born Aug. 12, 1905 in <LOCATION> Lucerne </LOCATION>. After studies in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he was ordained in 1936. Except for a brief period as religious caretaker of Swiss students in the 1940s, he concentrated on writing theological works. His 1952 essay, `` The Razing of the Bastions,'' was considered to be one of the most important works published in preparation of the Second Vatican Council. After the 1963-65 council, however, he wrote texts that were critical of conciliar reforms. Since then, he had been rated as pro-conservative. His nomination May 29 by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> came as a surprise to many Catholics. He told reporters that as an obedient member of the church he accepted the honor but added that he had asked the pontiff several years ago to `` spare me any titles.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthasar </PERSON> held honorary doctorates from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and from universities in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Four American Jews said Sunday after returning from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> that they were beaten by Austrian police when they demonstrated against Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s meetings with Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The four made the charge during a news conference at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and also said they encountered anti-Semitism from some Austrians during their weekend of protests in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Synagogue </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said he and three students were beaten by police after they displayed a large photograph of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in a Nazi uniform at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, a former concentration camp that the pope visited. `` We felt the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> was obscene ... after he embraced <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> whose hands are red with Jewish blood,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` This is an effort by the pope to de-Judaize the Holocaust.'' Jewish groups have complained that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> did not mention Jews during his visit to the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> camp, though he mentioned by name some Catholics who died there. Jewish organizations have charged that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who was in the German army in World War II, was involved in war crimes. He denies the allegations but was barred from visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government found evidence <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in deporting <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> citizens during the war.

 Vigdis Finnbogadottir swept to a third term as <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s president, overwhelmingly defeating another woman for the post, according to final ballot results released Sunday. Mrs. <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON> had more than 94 percent of Saturday's vote and her rival, <PERSON> Sigrun </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>, garnered less than 6 percent. Election officials said about 75 percent of the 173,800 eligible voters in the sparsely populated <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island nation cast ballots. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>, who conceded defeat in a television interview after polls closed Saturday, said the election had been a great victory for all `` democratic and freedom-loving people in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'' as opposed to the `` autocratic and monarchist'' supporters of the establishment. President Finnbogadottir said in a television interview she was delighted by the results and that any incumbent president would be satisfied with such overwhelming support. Vigdis, as the president is popularly known among the 250,000 Icelanders, was the world's first democratically elected woman head of state. She defeated three men in 1980. She was re-elected without opposition in 1984 and was host of the <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> superpower summit in October 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON> has been active within the <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which so far has failed to get a representative elected to the Althing, the world's oldest parliament. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON> ran on a platform of giving the presidential office a more active role. Mrs. <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON> maintained that the presidency was created as a ceremonial post and should remain so. The real power in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> rests with the prime minister, <PERSON> Thorsteinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON>. Saturday was the first time an incumbent president has faced a re-election challenge since <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, formerly under Danish rule, became a republic in 1944.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Move On From Nuclear Policy To AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> paused Sunday for prayer and relaxation before turning from a debate on nuclear policy to one on the morality of teaching about AIDS prevention. The Roman Catholic bishops held a public Mass Sunday morning and scheduled a cookout and prayer session in the evening, a day after approving a report that critics said was not strong enough in urging disarmament. The report, approved by a strong voice vote of the approximately 280 bishops, opposed deployment of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative. But it did not question the morality of continuing research on the `` Star Wars'' missile defense system within the bound of existing arms treaties. The bishops planned to end their four-day meeting at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here Monday by taking up a paper that says teaching about condom use would help prevent the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome Some bishops oppose the statement, saying it will be misinterpreted as condoning sex outside of marriage and the use of artificial birth control, both contrary to Roman Catholic doctrine. The report on nuclear policy was approved as an update to the bishops' 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear deterrence. The new report says, `` it is our prudential judgment that proposals to press development of SDI do not measure up to the moral criteria outlined in this report.'' The report recommended that `` defense spending as a whole not absorb a morally disproportionate percentage of the federal budget.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbleton </PERSON>, auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and the head of the peace group <ORGANIZATION> Pax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, said he will continue to work for the day when the bishops will say unequivocably that a policy of nuclear deterrence is immoral. <PERSON> Gumbleton </PERSON> estimated that 50 to 60 of the bishops at the conference feel the way he does. He said he and other bishops are planning to issue their own statement on deterrence as a supplement to the conference report. `` This report should not be the last word we say on nuclear deterrence,'' said Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who chaired the committee that wrote the report. Benedictine Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Malerich </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Pax </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, called the report `` a step in the right direction.'' `` Weapons are n't the answer,'' said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, a former coordinator of Pax Christi. `` They have n't solved a problem yet. Why not try something else? Maybe we as a people have to be more active in speaking out, rather than leaving it to our bishops.'' In other business Saturday, the bishops approved a campaign to raise $ 20 million for retirement funds. Many orders ca n't afford to support older members because fewer younger people are joining, and the cost of care is escalating. It costs $ 400 million annually to care for the 40,000 men and women in religious orders who are 70 years and older, according to Sister <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudon </PERSON>, the head of the church's retirement project.

 The last time <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sang at a jazz festival here, she looked grandmotherly. This time, slim and sexy in a small-waisted gray gown and a sparkling orange pants suit, she was more in <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s category Saturday night's <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall thrilled the audience, which seemed to be mostly in their 20s and 30s, musically as well. There were spontaneous standing ovations and cheering at particularly telling bits of scat singing, growling imitations of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and triumphant high notes. The greatest novelty, which worked superbly, was the 70-year-old singer's doing an oldie, `` Ai n't Nobody's Business,'' to a disco beat. Guitarist <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who has performed in Carnegie Hall 10 times but never before sat in the audience, said: `` To me, she's an instrument. She has that fantastic pitch.'' The concert lasted 2 -LCB- hours, with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> singing except for a brief segment after intermission by her trio, witty pianist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, her longtime bassist <PERSON> Keter </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> and new drummer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON>. She recently resumed performing after an absence of several months, her health problems seemingly behind her. She was hospitalized last year with diabetes and had coronary bypass surgery in 1986. Her voice was strong throughout. She drew cheers and chuckles, opening with `` Mr. <PERSON> Paganini </PERSON>,'' which begins, `` The concert was over in <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>.'' She sang a lot of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, every song enjoyable _ `` Caravan,'' `` Love You Madly,'' `` Sophisticated Lady,'' `` Squeeze Me,'' `` Satin Doll,'' and a gently swung `` Take the A Train.'' Cheers followed her into the wings after `` I Ca n't Give You Anything but Love,'' sung first in the style of Rose `` Chi Chi'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, then of Satchmo. Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> never `` talked'' her songs or sat down on a stool placed on the stage. In the second half, she sang seemingly with more ease and open, warm tone. She also projected more feeling than she sometimes has done in the past, especially in a Gershwin medley. The audience, getting its first look at the slim pants suit after intermission, whistled and cheered the lines `` Tell <PERSON> Lizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> to leave me alone; my shape is my own'' in her kickoff tune, `` The Lady Is a Tramp.'' Miss <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sang a bossa nova in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, did `` A House Is Not a Home'' when somebody yelled a request for it, scatted and did some dance steps to a swinging `` Stomping at the Savoy.'' The audience did n't want to let her go, and she came back for several encores _ `` You Are the Sunshine of My Life,'' `` Mack the Knife'' and `` I Only Have Eyes for You.'' She told the cheering audience she'd like to take them with her to the next gig; the audience was ready to go.

<HEAD>Police Destroy Building, Palestinians Claim Soldiers Injecting
Them</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops declared a curfew in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday, then blew up the second floor of a building from where they believe a firebomb was thrown that burned two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, residents of the <LOCATION> Al-Amari </LOCATION> refugee camp told reporters Sunday that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers injected at least two men with an unknown substance to pry from them information about other Palestinians. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police uncovered several <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla units blamed for organizing protests and throwing firebombs at police patrols and the car of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The report said the units were attached to the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and the Moslem fundamentalist <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>. It did not say how many Palestinians were involved. A firebomb missed <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s car on May 24. The explosions in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> came in the wake of a firebomb attack Monday night that seriously injured two soldiers driving through the city in a jeep. An Arab reporter said he heard at least four blasts after the army announced a curfew over loudspeakers, saying residents should not be frightened if they heard explosions. He said he could not see the blasts because he had to remain in his home under the curfew order. The reporter said some damage was caused to the shops on the first floor of the building and the army ordered residents to clean up debris caused by the explosions. Earlier, he said, at least six shopkeepers were called to military headquarters over complaints of firebombs thrown from their buildings. At least 211 Palestinians have been killed since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied territories. Four Israelis have died. In the <PERSON> Al-Amari </PERSON> refugee camp, <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahli </PERSON>, 24, said soldiers seized him on Friday and injected him through a hypodermic needle while asking him the names of stone throwers and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Shabiba </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> youth movement. The army said it was investigating the report. <PERSON> Mahli </PERSON> said the soldiers took the syringe from a black attache case, then blindfolded him. He said he felt the soldiers try to inject him in the forearm, then do so on the inside of the elbow. `` The pain was exactly like any injection,'' he said. `` I thought I was being poisoned. I was very afraid.'' The young man showed two marks on his arm he said were from the injections and deep scratches on his upper arm which he said the soldiers also inflicted. One of the soldiers told him, `` After I inject you, you will tell me everything,'' <PERSON> Mahli </PERSON> said. Another Palestinian, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahoud </PERSON>, said he was questioned along with <PERSON> Mahli </PERSON> and saw the injection being given. <PERSON> Mahli </PERSON> said he had chills and a headache Friday night. The next day he went to <LOCATION> Maqaseed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but doctors could not find anything wrong with him. A hospital official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Mahli </PERSON> had bruised veins from an injection, but it was impossible to tell what substance he had been given. <PERSON> Masaad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, a driver for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said his 19-year-old son, <LOCATION> Midhad </LOCATION>, was also seized in the camp Friday by four soldiers who gave him an injection while questioning him. <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> said he sent his son to the home of an uncle and was trying to find a house outside the <PERSON> Al-Amari </PERSON> camp. `` I do n't want to live here anymore after what happened to my son,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday accused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of inaction in the fight against drugs, but a representative of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> immediately turned the blame on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In speeches at a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., each laid the blame for failing to quell the drug crisis at the other's <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican presidential nominee, also said he would be tough in prosecution of drug dealers and would convert unneeded military bases into minimum security prisons. He said he had no specific bases in mind but would expect his secretary of defense to review the matter. On the drug issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law enforcement, some of them go AWOL,'' short for absent without leave. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reduced the administration's <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget request last year by $ 72 million, and by $ 864 million over four years. But <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> claimed it was the administration that did the cutting and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that restored dollars for drug-fighting efforts. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's 1988 budget sought a $ 900 million cut in anti-drug funds, including money for <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> interdiction efforts. It also included a 60 percent cut in drug prevention and education programs. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restored 70 percent of the funds and he labeled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim of congressional laxity as `` just a bogus argument.'' In a prepared statement, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> also accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of personal failure as head of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said the panel `` was found to be an organization of half-empty offices lacking organization'' and added that it virtually ignored the air charters that are `` the most commmon means of smuggling cocaine into southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said he was addressing the group as a surrogate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has sewn up the Democratic presidential nomination and is spending a few days vacationing in <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. In a news conference after his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> debunked a report that his aides have zeroed in on Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> as the leading candidate to become <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. `` Nobody is authorized to peak in my behalf,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the report in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have not begun the process in terms of lists,'' he said. `` There is n't a long list or a short list.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, while campaigning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, was asked about chances he would be the running mate and said: `` If I got the call, I'd say, ` Mr. Vice President, let's talk,' but that has n't happened.'' Discussing what he will look for in a running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I want to have an inclusion of the vice president on things. That suggests a certain philosophical compatibility, not on every single issue, but a philosophical compatibility and a tempermental compatibility ... so you're not looking over wondering if the vice president is posturing and cutting up the president.'' In his remarks to the police group, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for: mandatory testing of `` anyone responsible for the public safety,'' recriminalization of drug possession in states where it has been decriminalized, the death penalty for drug kingpins and those who commit drug-related murders, and continuation of the `` zero tolerance'' policy aimed at users of drugs in even small amounts.

<HEAD>Paisley Reportedly Able to Win Pentagon Job Despite Bribery
Allegations</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a central figure in the growing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud scandal, was able to win a top <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post despite widespread allegations that he had bribed government officials and wiretapped competitors, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that two executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had sought to get <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> fired from his job 10 years ago because they were alarmed about his conduct, which they said included charging fees for prostitutes to his expense account. `` Usually every major company has one guy who does the dirty business,'' former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was the guy.'' <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press Thursday night, said he passed along information to the government more than six years ago that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had bragged of committing a felony wiretapping operation and of committing bribery internationally on military projects. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s lawyer, called the allegations `` unfounded'' and suggested they came from people with axes of their own to grind. He called <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> `` a disgruntled ex-employee.'' `` I just really think that dredging up 5 -, 10 - and 15-year-old unproven and unfounded allegations ... is really stooping beneath the barrel,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> Calls to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman were not immediately returned. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s reputation has been that of a fast-living playboy who left behind a string of allegations of questionable conduct. <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> described <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> as a `` hard-drinking, two-fisted man's man'' who would stop at nothing to get his way `` He loved to talk, he loved to brag. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> had certain priorities: women, money and business _ particularly women,'' he said. The latest revelations about <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s past raise questions about how he could have passed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks necessary to become assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 with access to the government's highest secrets about weapons and reconnaissance satellites. One of <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s three ex-wives, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGetrick </PERSON>, said she told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> at the time that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> `` was dishonest with money'' and had accepted cash and gifts as gratuities. <PERSON> McGetrick </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>, said she had sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> then-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> saying that `` Mr. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has been known to take bribes.'' Tower's panel was then considering <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s nomination as a top aide to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>. The Times said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> for 27 years, had hired <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> while a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> executive and later brought him to the Pentagon as a deputy. After <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> stayed with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and is suspected of having supplied classified material to <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who used it in his consulting work. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s office and home were searched by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as part of the investigation into the alleged bribery scandal. No one has been charged in the case. <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> loved to brag, and had told colleagues about bugging a competitor for a military contract in 1970, about bribing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officers overseas and about hiding payoffs and wild parties with prostitutes on his military-contract expense reports. When he went to work for <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, `` People used to laugh and say he wo n't last six months,'' <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said. `` As soon as they do a security check, he'll be out. I guess they never did. We never thought he'd last.'' <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said at one point a prominent <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> consultant in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, Sir <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, complained that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was so blatant in his offers of payoffs there that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was made `` persona non grata'' in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Information is the essence of the business,'' <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said. `` There are good ways to do it and bad ways. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON>, unfortunately, always used the bad ways.''

 An 11-year-old pilot took off Sunday for a 4,100-mile trip to the northernmost tip of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a flying feat her dad says is the first for a girl. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON>, wearing oversized bows on her blonde curls, sat on four pillows so she could see out the window of her <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 182, which lifted off about 11 a.m. from an airstrip here for the first hop of the weeklong journey. `` I really like the idea of flying,'' said the sixth-grader who last year talked her <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pilot dad, Maj. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON>, into giving her lessons. `` It took him a while to let me. He did n't want me to do it. But now he helps me.'' <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> will go with his daughter on the flight to <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which will feature overnight stops in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and the Canadian cities of <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> and her dad believe she will be the youngest girl to make such a cross-country flight.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament ended in failure Sunday after delegates failed to adopt a final document on nuclear arms reduction. The session ended Sunday morning after committee meetings could not end differences in disarmament positions held by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and developing nations and a more cautious approach backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some of its Western allies. The four-week session of the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the third in 10 years to focus on disarmament, cost the financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> about $ 7.4 million. Delegates never voted on a final document. Committee delegates decided not to attempt to pass a resolution without consensus. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has no enforcement power over its decisions. Delegates believed a final resolution adopted by consensus, however, would carry the moral authority of expressing the will of the world community. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some of its Western allies opposed most other nations on issues ranging from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space-based defense program known as `` Star Wars,'' the monitoring of land-based weapons, and a Soviet call for a joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials described the past week's committee debates as `` very intense and arduous.'' Some delegates said there were sharp confrontations and shouting in at least one closed session. `` A certain country which should have important disarmament responsibilities had insisted on its position. That was a major reason that consensus was not achieved,'' said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengyia </PERSON>, referring to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> also noted that no agreement was possible `` because of the actions of some states.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` regretted very much that it had not been possible to achieve consensus on the chairman's draft document, which had been acceptable in large part to most delegations.'' During the special session, the Soviets called for the elimination of all nuclear weapons by the end of the century; troop reductions of 500,000 soldiers each by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and a ban on `` Star Wars.'' Since the session began May 31, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was also at odds with other positions favored by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including an expanded role for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in multilateral verification of nuclear weapons and naval nuclear disarmament. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> favored emphasis on conventional disarmament, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact is regarded as having military superiority.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' understanding of foreign policy on Sunday, saying his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival comes to a `` troubling conclusion'' in emphasizing conventional weapons. Backers of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> struck a unified note this weekend in agreeing on a party platform noteworthy for its brevity. The vice president said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of experience in foreign policy is fertile ground for debate and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will spell out their differences on conventional weapons and strategic defense. The all-but-certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' increased emphasis on conventional forces and calls for cuts in nuclear systems indicates a `` troubling conclusion about winnability for a conventional force war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The issue `` is a very serious debate that has not been joined ... will be joined by me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters en route to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for a campaign appearance. `` Obviously he -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- will have to join it. I think I will come out well on that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police, accused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of inaction in the war on drugs and cited the $ 72 million cut in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget request. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is full of rhetorical heroes on the issues of drugs, but when it comes to law enforcement some of them go AWOL,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the organization's national board meeting in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, addressing the group as a surrogate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, disputed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claims, noting that the administration's 1988 budget sought a $ 900 million cut in anti-drug funding, including money for <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> interdiction efforts. It also included a 60 percent cut in drug prevention and education programs. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restored 70 percent of the funds and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim is `` just a bogus argument.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for permitting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts, saying, `` How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs when we're cutting <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols by 55 percent? It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the presidency.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is vacationing in <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> this weekend, staying at the home of friends. The likely Democratic nominee received promising news from his party platform delegates in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> where a blueprint plan was worked out. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backers easily turned aside <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> efforts to add planks that would have committed the Democrats to raise taxes on the wealthy, freeze the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, double education spending, commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to no first use of nuclear weapons and to a call for Palestinian self-determination. The committees handled without rancor a number of amendments, rejecting some key <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stands but accepting others, including ones calling for Third World debt relief and significant increases in child care aid for low-and middle-income families. `` Although we have differences ... about 95 percent of all the issues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolved in a peaceful and in a unified way, and I know that scares the Republicans to death,'' said former <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> who introduced a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budget amendment that failed. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman who led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' platform team, said that in working on the past four party platforms, `` I have never seen a situation that was anywhere near this unified. In <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor spoke with his senior aide <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> before departing for his four-day vacation on Friday and did not receive a briefing after the vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s platform committee While the action was taken amid signals of party unity, and displayed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strength in controlling the platform issue, <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> made no claim that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month would be free of floor battles over the platform. `` We have a good working relationship with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign, and things are going well,'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said. But he added, `` I think he's said all along there could very well be some floor fights at the convention.'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform chief, said no decisions had been made on which if any of the issues <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would fight for on the floor of next month's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. However, she said that the two Democrats `` in these proceedings moved closer together.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, said he does n't want a convention of floor fights, but indicated that he was n't satisfied with the weekend work of the platform committee. `` There will no doubt be some minority positions taken to the floor,'' he told reporters. `` I do not think bland is beautiful. People ought to be specific, ought to make promises, ought to keep promises, ought to be make commitments. People have given a mandate.'' The moderate platform, which will not be final until approved by the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on July 19, is expected to run about 4,000 words _ the shortest since the terse platforms that <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> ran on in 1932 and 1936. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up 10 delegates at the state convention, and party spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said nine uncommitted delegates will back the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, giving him a 49-12 advantage over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. At the GOP state convention, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gained all 37 delegates. The two presidential contenders both finished third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s initial contest five months ago

 Brother fought brother and the North won again Sunday as more than 8,000 uniformed men re-enacted the final charge of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> to commemorate its 125th anniversary. <PERSON> Griff </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of the 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> planned to participate in <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s charge against a line of Union troops, where his brother would defend a ridge with the 93rd <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Regiment. `` We do n't agree on anything anyway,'' said King, a 35-year-old machine operator from <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. About 12,500 mock soldiers and civilians in period garb took part in the three-day re-enactment billed as the largest ever, organizers Some 140,000 people witnessed the event over three days, according to organizers with <ORGANIZATION> Napoleonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which staged the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the actual battlefield. Following a series of cannon blasts by both sides, a 200-yard line of Confederate troops gave a rebel yell and marched shoulder-to-shoulder up to a wall defended by Union troops. Troops for the North and South traded volley after volley in an engagement staged at one-third its original scale. `` It was a great battle,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, a 37-year-old marketing manager from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who repeatedly fired for the 52nd <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> as soldiers for both sides fell around him. `` The rifle barrels were getting so hot you could n't touch them,'' he said. Confederate troops fell back after an hour of fighting in the re-enactment. The event ended with soldiers standing in silence for an invocation to those who died in the actual battle. A bugler played taps while 75 cannons fired one after another. As more than 60,000 people massed along a hillside Sunday to witness the mock charge, a woman stood in 19th-century black mourning dress to remind them of the consequences of war. `` Mourning is appropriate for battle because men die ... women had to carry on,'' said <PERSON> Lanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alligood </PERSON>, whose beau `` died'' during fighting Saturday. Ms. <PERSON> Alligood </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said she traveled with a group of about 15 women from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, most of whom dressed in black. The Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> occurred July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed or wounded over the course of the battle. Major Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s unsuccessful charge with more than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the Confederate's final offensive push of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>. `` If the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> was the turning point of the Civil War, then <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s charge was the turning point of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holien </PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of Military History. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he decided to join the Confederate army because he believes in states' rights over the encroachment by the federal government, a battle he said continues. `` The battlefield is the courtroom now,'' said <PERSON> King </PERSON>, as he packed up his tent before the final charge.

 The `` gender gap'' giving Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> an early lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might disappear on Election Day, said former presidential candidate <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> who warned that factors dividing female voters should not be underestimated. Even though most women prefer <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee, it does n't mean they will vote for him in November, <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> told about 1,000 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. `` We're not as monolithic as led to believe,'' she said, noting regional, economic and age difference among women voters. `` You constantly talk about being 53 percent of the vote, but if you are unable to deliver that, you will be ignored,'' said the former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> congresswoman who ran for president in 1972. <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> said there was similar talk of a gender gap in 1984 when the Republican ticket of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handed the Democratic ticket of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrao </PERSON> a disastrous defeat. `` Many women, particulary southern women, could n't identify with <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>,'' she said. `` We've got ask why and learn from our mistakes.'' Part of the problem, she said, is that feminists are often intolerant of opposing views. For the last decade, she said, women's right groups have judged candidates mainly on their abortion postions. Women candidate who are not pro-choice are often opposed, she said. `` You ca n't use one issue as a litmus test,'' she said. `` You ca n't be that emotional about politics.'' She said Democratic women should recognize that the party will need to have a southerner or someone acceptable to southerners on the ticket if it expects to win in November. `` You had better be prepared to accomodate the more conservative views of southern women if you expect to maintain national political power,'' she said. `` You ca n't afford to alienate them.'' <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> campaigned for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this year.

 A teen-ager beat his mother to death the morning he was to graduate as valedictorian of his class, apparently because she was being overbearingly protective, police said Sunday. `` He claimed his mother would n't give him any freedom,'' Detective Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clute </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>, 17, was in jail without bond Sunday after police said he confessed to using a baseball bat to crush the skull of his 56-year-old mother, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON>, during an argument about 3 a.m. Saturday. The boy said his mother hit him first, <PERSON> Clute </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>, who is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, was charged with murder just 10 hours before he was to graduate with honors from <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The graduation ceremony was held as scheduled Saturday, but with no valedictory speech and no mention of the killing, said principal <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guerrucci </PERSON> said school officials did not want to remind the class of 250 students of the tragedy, `` but it definitely dampened the day.'' `` The graduates were understandaly upset. ... Obviously, they do n't want the day to be remembered by what happened to their valedictorian,'' the principal said. Friends and neighbors reacted with disbelief that the crime could have been committed by the handsome and popular teen-ager, who hoped to become a lawyer and was to attend the highly selective <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> in the fall. `` You ca n't say anything bad about him. ... He was just supernice,'' said <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON>, a neighbor whose father had called police. `` And his mom was one of those, ` Can I do anything for you?' persons. ... She was always helping.'' A classmate, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, said he'd never seen Shrubsall get angry. Another classmate, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, said he could n't believe <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> committed the crime. `` He had everything going for him,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said. `` A class valedictorian would n't do something like that. He was the smartest guy in the whole school.'' <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>, said the boy and his mother outwardly seemed to enjoy a good relationship, but had a history of problems that led up to the killing. `` He made a detailed statement of that to police and it will come out in court,'' <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that Mrs. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> had physically beaten the boy on previous occasions. The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying that despite the boy's success in school, his mother pressured him to do more. The newspaper report did not offer any evidence of beatings, or discuss when or how often they may have occurred. <PERSON> Clute </PERSON> said the slaying occurred during an argument over <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>'s returning late from his girlfriend's house two blocks away. Mrs. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> had called the girl's home demanding that her son return, and when he arrived she was waiting for him in the driveway, police said. An argument continued inside with Mrs. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> threatening to call the girl's parents. When she picked up the telephone, the boy tried to stop her and she struck him in the face with the receiver, police said. Police said the two had lived alone in their well-kept suburban home since <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, died in 1985.

 Club-wielding police brutally dispersed thousands of Crimean Tatars who massed Sunday to protest the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s refusal to give them back their homeland, a protester said Sunday <PERSON> Server </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuvarchy </PERSON>, who took part in the demonstration in the <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, said 5,000 people gathered on the city's Revolution Square in front of Communist party headquarters. `` The militia beat people,'' <PERSON> Tuvarchy </PERSON>, a Crimean Tatar activist, said in a telephone interview. `` I myself took a girl to the hospital who had been beaten so badly she was unconscious.'' <PERSON> Tuvarchy </PERSON> said at least two people had been arrested. He said at <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>'s southern railway station, up to 300 Tatars had been held by police to prevent them from taking part in the protest. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, dissident <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> quoted telephone reports from <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> as saying up to 20,000 people took part in the demonstration in front of Communist Party headquarters. `` The demonstration was roughly broken up by militiamen who kicked the participants and beat them with clubs,'' <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said reports telephoned from the scene said hundreds may have been injured. The demonstration in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, about 1,600 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was called to protest a government decision this month that denied the Crimean Tatars their own homeland, <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said. On June 9, a government commission led by President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> ruled that there were `` no grounds for establishing a <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> autonomy.'' That announcement was a major setback for the Tatars, who for decades have been demanding a return to their ancestral homeland on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> deported the Tatars from the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> during World War II for allegedly collaborating with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The Crimean Tatars, who today number from 250,000 to 300,000, were absolved of the war collaboration charge in 1967 but were still not allowed to return en masse to the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>. A statement issued by the government commission said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had eased restrictions that barred some Tatars from returning to the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>. `` Since the middle of 1987, some 2,500 Crimean Tatars have been granted residence permits and fixed up with jobs in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>,'' the commission said. Crimean Tatar leaders have said those measures are inadequate, and they have demanded the revival of the Crimean Tatar autonomous region abolished by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> were also protesting the treatment of Crimean Tatars in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Authorities in the Soviet capital, bent on preventing Tatar demonstrations during the nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that begins Tuesday, are immediately sending Crimean Tatars who arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> back home, <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said. One activist drew a 10-day jail term for arguing with a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> police officer, he said. <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON> said the protesters in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> managed to deliver a petition listing their grievances to someone at <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s Communist Party headquarters before the protest was broken up The government commission on the Crimean Tatars was established last summer, after members of the ethnic group held an extraordinary overnight demonstration at Red Square to press their demands.

 A group that helped defeat a referendum to finance a rail and subway system in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and its suburbs recommended Sunday that a streamlined transit authority find other ways to ease traffic congestion. Some 59 percent of the voters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and 15 suburbs, the area served by <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>, rejected a proposal Saturday to sell $ 1 billion in bonds to begin construction of a 93-mile commuter rail system. The outcome was a victory for a group called <ORGANIZATION> Sensible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>, which waged a small-budget campaign against the bond proposal. `` I think <PERSON> DART </PERSON> is at a crossroads,'' former <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a leader of the citizens' group, said Sunday. `` The election is now behind us. We now have the opportunity to reassess where we are, what we've learned, and decide how to proceed from here.'' Saturday's results represented a turnabout from 1982, when 58 percent of the voters approved the measure that established DART, a regional agency that was to develop a mass transit plan, including a regional rail system. The decision throws the transit agency's future into question because suburbs may call an election to withdraw from the agency. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburbs contribute about 45 percent of its financing. The agency had no official contingency plan in the event of a defeat and `` will return to the drawing board,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, its executive director. Some transit authority board members see the bond vote as a mandate to develop a new transportation plan. Virtually all of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' major freeways are at least 20 years old, and most are burdened with traffic that meets or exceeds capacity. Members of citizens' group say the area's traffic problems can be solved by systems other than rail. Many of the recommendations the group made Sunday included restructuring and streamlining the transit authority, which critics say has become a bloated bureaucracy. The group also recommended that the transit agency develop a regional mobility plan that does not require incurring long-term debt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceverha </PERSON>, president of the citizens' group, said such a plan could include some rail, but added, `` The election shows that the economics of mass transit are so fundamentally different today than they were a generation ago that they -LRB- the voters -RRB- regard fixed rail and subway solutions as folly.''

In the German Third Reich, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed thousands of the handicapped under what they called `` euthanasia programs'' or mercy killings. `` Decades ago, this division led to the worst forms of barbarism,'' said the pontiff on the fourth day of his five-day visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The 50th anniversary of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has prompted widespread soul-searching in this Alpine nation. Jewish leaders have called on him to urge Austrians to come to terms with the country's Nazi-era past. The pontiff often has called for greater respect for the handicapped and for elderly people who are sick. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is vehemently opposed to mercy killing, saying it goes against <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s teachings. After the prayer service, the pontiff donned a green robe and warned of drug abuse in an outdoor Mass before 25,000 people in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>'s Residence Square. In his homily, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> cited `` the fear of man's dangerous potential for violence and destruction'' and urged parents to `` help your adolescent sons and daughters to withstand the temptations of escaping into the sham world of drugs.'' Also Sunday, in a gesture of reconciliation, the pontiff took part in an ecumenical prayer service in a Lutheran church with representatives of 12 other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> churches and denominations in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Papal trip organizers said the service was one of the first in which the pontiff has participated in a Protestant church. The pope said many Catholics and Protestants shared suffering in World War II and `` experienced their deep union in Christ's cross, especially in the extremely difficult ordeal of the concentration camps,'' he said. In an afternoon talk to about 150 young people in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youth center, the pontiff again referred to the 1933-1945 Nazi era `` Nobody can undo what has already been done,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` Even the best psychologists can not free us from the burden of our past. Only the omnipotence of God can do this.'' Many Austrians actively supported <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> after the 1938 annexation, although the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> targeted Jews, leftist politicians and other foes for immediate arrest and persecution. The pontiff told the youths that God `` cleanses even the contaminated soil of our souls with the mercy of forgiveness and thus gives us the strength for honest reconciliation with the people we have hurt.'' He also told them that if past failures are simply swept under the rug, `` they will poison our spiritual environment.'' On Saturday, he called the suffering of Jewish and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> `` a gift to the world.'' Four American Jews said Sunday that they were beaten by Austrian police when they demonstrated against the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s meetings with Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The four made the charge during a news conference at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and also said they encountered anti-Semitism from Austrian people Rabbi <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Synagogue </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said he and three students were beaten by police after they displayed a large photograph of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in a Nazi uniform at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, a former concentration camp that the pope visited. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied allegations by Jewish groups that he participated in war crimes while serving with the German army in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the Kurier daily newspaper reported that Austrian television canceled an evening broadcast of the film version of a story the pontiff wrote in 1960 when he was bishop of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The newspaper said that RAI Italian radio and television requested the cancellation so that the new film can first be shown to the pope at a private screening in July. Austrian television will show the film version of the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s work, called `` The <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s Shop,'' this fall, <PERSON> Kurier </PERSON> said The pontiff retired for the night in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>. He was scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Innsbruck </LOCATION> Monday evening.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> plans to announce an overhaul of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> government aimed at streamlining the organization, Italian newspapers reported Sunday. The reorganization is to be announced Tuesday, the day the pontiff is scheduled to formally install 25 cardinals. The reforms will increase the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s control over the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> bank, give the Secretariat of State more power and establish a commission for relations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and its lay employees, the newspapers said. The church hierarchy has been discussing the reform of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> government, known as the Curia, for several years. The Milan-based newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> reported the plan would give the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> responsibility for supervising the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> bank, officially called the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, which has traditionally answered only to the pope. The bank has been the subject of controversy since Italian authorities issued arrest warrants in February 1987 for its president, American Archbishop <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON>, and two of its lay employees in connection with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest banking scandal. Prosecutors accused the men of being accessories to the fraudulent bankruptcy of the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled earlier in July that Italian courts could not prosecute the three because the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> was considered a sovereign state under treaties between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. According to the newspaper reports, the reform will trim the influence of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ making it just another department of the Secretariat of State. The Council has functioned as part of the Secretariat but has enjoyed a high profile and a certain amount of autonomy. The last major reform of the Curia was announced in 1967 by Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>. It provided that modern languages could be used in official documents, made diocesan bishops members of all <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> government departments and implemented changes brought about by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which ran from 1962-65.

<TEXT>
 A partly deaf boy found wandering in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last year was fitted with a hearing aid Saturday and taken to an airport in the hope he would recognize an aircraft that would help lead to his identity. The boy, nicknamed <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON>, frequently tugged at the device tucked behind his left ear and was distracted by the noise of takeoffs and landings. Officials at the Juarez center for the Development of the Integrated Family named the unidentified boy <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> because he was found on a Saturday _ sabado in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>. News reports have spelled the boy's name as <PERSON> Sabat </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cota </PERSON> of the family agency said the name is spelled <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON>. A hearing test two weeks ago determined the freckle-faced boy was deaf in the right ear and had about 20 percent hearing in the left. The $ 760 hearing aid was donated by an El Paso audiologist. <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> communicates mostly through gestures and drawings. Some of his pictures seem to indicate he survived a plane crash that killed his parents and sister. For that reason, <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after he was fitted with the hearing aid Saturday morning. Officials hoped he would recognize the type of plane he may have crashed in, but the boy paid little attention to the aircraft. `` It was not as successful as I anticipated,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, a caseworker with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> who accompanied the boy. <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> was found wandering near downtown Juarez Nov. 7, 1987. Because <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> does not speak, write or use sign language, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican officials have been unable to determine where he is from. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was called into the case when <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials noticed <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> prefers American food and cartoon characters to their Mexican counterparts, leading them to believe <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> could be American. Officials trying to identify <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> have chased leads in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The newest lead comes from <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where a woman says her son disappeared about seven months ago. She described her son as deaf, about 8 years old, with brown hair, freckles and light skin _ a good description of <LOCATION> Sabath </LOCATION>. Officials are waiting for the woman to send pictures of her son, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON>.

<HEAD>British Airways Suspends Service on A320s</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-France-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> suspended service on its two A320 aircraft as of midnight Sunday, hours after a new <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> plane of the same type crashed during an air show and killed at least three people. The narrow-bodied short-to-medium-range A320 jet entered commercial service in April, and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> took possession of its second this month. Air France took delivery Thursday of the plane that crashed Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> announced it was suspending both its A320s from routes between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and various European destinations starting at midnight. `` Following discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, we have decided to suspend the A320 services as a precautionary measure pending further information on the cause of today's accident,'' an airline spokeswoman said. She said alternative planes had been arranged and she did not anticipate any cancellations of flights. She was not identified, in keeping with British practice. The Airbus A320 received its certification Feb. 26. The A320 was conceived and certified for flight by a two-member crew, eliminating the navigator. Early this year, pilots and flight engineers of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, the largest French airline, called a series of strikes to protest the use of only two cockpit members in A320s, saying it was unsafe. According to witnesses, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> plane, taking part in a show in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> border, made a low pass over the small Habsheim airfield, clipped some trees at the end of the runway and plunged into a forest. A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> spokesman for the manufacturer, the four-nation <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> consortium in which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a large stake, refused comment on the possible effects for the consortium, saying only: `` Investigators are looking into the incident along with the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. There will be a full investigation.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON>, air transport editor of the respected journal, <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the A320 had been the most successful aircraft ever in terms of winning record orders before it was even in service. Furthermore, he said, the circumstances of a display flight and an ordinary commercial passenger flight were quite different. `` Display flights during a show are designed to show the people on the ground and on board the maximum use that that aircraft could provide,'' he said. `` I do n't predict that the aviation world is going to react violently to this. `` However, I am not saying that this is a situation to be dismissed. ... It needs a lot of very, very careful looking into,'' <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON> said. The A320 is the first aircraft equipped with electronic flight system and controls that are beside the pilot instead of in front of the pilot. The jet consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar two or three engine jets it is designed to replace.

<HEAD>Heart Association Approves Plan to OK Some Foods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> approved a system Sunday to identify and endorse processed foods that meet the group's dietary guidelines. The association said it will look mainly at the salt, cholesterol and fat levels in food products in deciding whether to endorse them as `` heart-healthy.'' Items bearing the group's seal of approval are expected to reach shelves within a year. `` We regard this new initiative as a logical expansion of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s well-established role as the public's chief advocate, and efforts to reduce premature death and disability from heart disease and stroke,'' said Dr. <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AHA </ORGANIZATION> task force that studied the product approval idea for the past two years The first group of foods that will be examined by an independent testing group will be margarines, cooking oils and salad dressings. The association does not expect to endorse meats, fruits and other non-processed food items. The recommendation was made at the annual delegate assembly in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, which began Friday and ended Sunday. There were about 140 affiliates and scientific counsels represented at the delegate assembly. The delegates are the policy-making group for the AHA. Heart and blood vessel diseases are the nation's leading killers, and took nearly 1 million lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985, the most recent year for which statistics are complete. The AHA said nearly 65 million Americans have one or more forms of the diseases. Members of the task force said Sunday that dietary control is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Since 1961, the <ORGANIZATION> AHA </ORGANIZATION> has been recommending a diet low in fat, salt and cholesterol as a way to help reduce heart disease. `` Many Americans have adopted healthier eating habits, and dietary improvements recommended by the AHA clearly have played a part in the welcome decline in heart attack and stroke death rates that we have seen in the last two decades,'' <PERSON> Aston </PERSON> said. He added that two independent nationwide surveys of consumers and health specialists showed that they responded favorably to the AHA's efforts, and wanted more specific information about fat and cholesterol levels. The program will include creation of a consumer health information program. It will establish a toll-free national nutritional telephone hotline that will be staffed by registered dietitians who will give information about nutrition and risk factors for heart disease to the public and health professionals. The program also will include media campaigns and a brochure listing products that receive the AHA stamp of approval. The brochures will describe the program and provide other facts about risk factors, with an emphasis on the dangers of cigarette smoking and high blood pressure.

<TEXT>
 Nurses are squaring off with the nation's largest group of doctors for a battle this week over a physicians' proposal to offset the nursing shortage by creating a new class of bedside hospital worker. Doctors attending the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual policymaking convention, which opened Sunday, will debate a plan to establish a new type of lesser-trained hospital worker to provide some care to patients at bedside. <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> officials believe their plan for `` registered care technologists,'' who would handle such chores as changing bandages and taking vital signs, would be an innovative step toward easing the nation's nursing shortage. But the proposal has drawn harsh criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which contends the best answer to the shortage is to improve working conditions and pay nurses better salaries. `` It's an impractical, poorly thought-out proposal,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a nurse from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and an elected Cabinet member for the nurses' association. `` It could be potentially very dangerous.'' She said nurses often help diagnose problems with patients and act as a backstop to doctors. The technogists would n't have the expertise to spot medical complications or other problems in a patient, she said. <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Mo.-based association representing 188,000 nurses, plans to testify against the proposal during a hearing Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> convention. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also has organized a protest rally Monday morning. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> president, disputed the nurses' concerns and contended the bedside technologists would give nurses more time to perform vital, highly technical patient-care management tasks `` It is in addition to nurses,'' <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON> said. `` We are not threatening the nurses in any way. We want all the nurses we can get.'' Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Painter </PERSON>, an internist from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> devised the proposal because the nation's shortage of nurses is projected to hit 300,000 by `` We're dealing with a major shortage that does n't look like it will improve,'' Painter said. `` We do n't see this as a turf problem between medicine and nursing. ... Our view is the person who is really suffering from this acute shortage of bedside care is the patient.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> wants to test its idea on an experimental basis in states that now have the worst shortage of nurses, he said. The board's proposal would create three levels of `` registered care technologists.'' The first, an assistant technologist, would be a high school graduate who could begin working with patients after two months' training. The worker could become a full licensed technologist with an additional seven months' on-the-job training. With nine months of more specialized training, the worker would become an advanced technologist who could work in critical care units, Painter said. `` We thought it should be an apprentice-type training program,'' he said. `` We wanted to appeal to a different type of applicant who might not want to spend two to four years in college, but who would want to earn while they learn.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a nurse at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, called the proposal `` misguided.'' `` We do have a crisis right now because there is a shortage of nurses. But the solution to that is not to create an alternative health-care giver with lesser skills,'' she said. The proposal also has drawn criticism from within the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> ranks. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> delegation to the convention introduced a resolution to scrap the idea, contending it `` would further dilute the pool of available individuals for the nursing profession and would increase the cost of medical care by creating a new category of health care provider.'' Sunday was an opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, whose 420 members act as a policymaking legislature for the 295,000-member <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, gave his farewell speech as outgoing president of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>, saying members must work to counter the attitude among a small number of doctors `` that the profession is no longer worth fighting for and ... is no longer worth pursuing as a career.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, told the convention in a written report that doctors and scientists must be prepared to battle animal rights activists trying to ban the use of animals in medical research. `` I'm afraid that unless we undertake a massive effort to protect biomedical research ... these people are going to force medical science into a choice between experiments on animals and experiments on humans,'' <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said.

 Residents of a disputed region in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> voted at a public meeting to end a monthlong general strike, Soviet media reported Sunday. The work stoppage began in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region on May 23 to press demands that the predominantly Armenian region, part of the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, be annexed to neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The legislature of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> refused to cede the region, and the governments of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> have asked the Moscow-based Supreme Soviet legislature to intervene. However in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a Soviet deputy justice minister, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyshinsky </PERSON> indicated at a news conference Sunday that the region could not be transferred to Armenian control without the consent of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` As long as the decision about the transfer of -LRB- <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> -RRB- is not taken by <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, the Constitution does not allow a change in borders of the territory of a republic,'' <PERSON> Vyshinsky </PERSON> was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> residents met in the region's administrative center, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, on Saturday night and voted to end the strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` On the whole, the participants in the meeting took a constructive decision: to restore the rhythm of work,'' Pravda said. It said a majority had agreed with the decision. Pravda also said some in the crowd had not agreed with a call from the head of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Movsesyan </PERSON>, that they renounce the use of `` strong-arm methods'' as a means to pressure authorities into accepting their demands. Participants also rejected a suggestion that they wait until the end of a nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, scheduled to begin Tuesday, to see what actions they should take in line with the conference's decisions, Pravda said. The newspaper did not elaborate, but the decision could mean that demonstrations are planned in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> during the conference, the party's first in 47 years. Delegates at the conference are expected to discuss relations between the more than 100 ethnic groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, although the disagreement over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is not specifically on the agenda. The dispute has sparked huge demonstrations in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and unrest in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Officials say 32 people, including 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were killed in rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in late February and early March. Reports also said eight Armenians and eight Azerbaijanis were injured in fights in two Armenian villages this month. The labor daily Trud, in a Sunday report on the effects of the strike, said the situation in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> was `` red hot'' and that people were hiding at home rather than going to work. During the strike, factories stood idle, transport did not run and railway cars carrying foodstuffs remained unloaded, <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. It said the strike had cost the region about $ 50 million in losses in non-industrial goods alone. Trud said the strike had been a `` stab in the back for perestroika,'' <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for economic and social restructuring.

But Foreign Minister R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Sunday he has warned the Cubans that the military buildup could start an explosive confrontation. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON>, chairman of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs committee, spoke at a news conference a day after two days of U.S.-mediated peace talks on southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ended in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> participated in the talks, the third in a series. The talks were aimed at resolving the civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has thousands of troops, and ending South African rule in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told reporters Sunday the talks had achieved progress `` in atmosphere and procedure.'' But he said political decisions were necessary to bridge gaps between the countries involved. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some parties to the talks had hinted at concessions. He did not elaborate. He said among new elements in the peace talks were Cuban-Angolan agreement for total Cuban troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and Soviet-American contacts to resolve a number of international problems, including southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Basic political decisions still have to be made, and there is not much time to make them because of the military situation,'' the official said. <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> blamed an alleged South African attack on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> last December with 9,000 troops and heavy equipment for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s military buildup in the country. `` This brutal escalation launched by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was really what made it necessary for the <LOCATION> Angolan </LOCATION> government to ask <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for an increase in forces in necessary quantity, both men and equipment, in order to rebut this offensive and to overcome it,'' <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> said. `` The increase of Cuban troops, we did not deny ... It is the proportionate and appropriate response to an increase in brutal attacks launched by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' Interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on his way back to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he told the Cubans that `` with the closeness of a large number of military forces'' to the Namibian border `` you only need a spark to set a big fire to explode.'' <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> would not discuss how many Cuban troops are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He refused to confirm or deny South African claims that 15,000 to 17,000 Cubans now are in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and more than 50,000 in the country as a whole. He said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent forces to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1975 at the request of <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. In the peace talks, which started last month in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to set up a formula using a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as a trigger to get <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to start granting <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence. <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON> said final agreement would foreshadow a `` gradual and total'' withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s military contingent. He gave no details. The leading Egyptian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Angolan-Cuban </LOCATION> delegation had offered a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal program to be complete in four years. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it should take no more than eight months. A new round of talks is scheduled for next month in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>.

 Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> toured a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp Sunday and met with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders who urged him to press the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to hold talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> welcomed Uno at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The 22-hour trip was the first visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by a Japanese Cabinet minister. Uno, 65, also has visited <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour. At a dinner hosted by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> stressed the urgency of reaching a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement. `` The state of affairs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is daily shown on the televisions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the Japanese people are following the developments in this region with ... deep apprehension,'' he said. `` The situation demands an early solution.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> supports an independent Palestinian state and has urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw all its forces from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. It has also urged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist group. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group released a statement condemning <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The group launched a bloody attack on Lod airport near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in 1972 that left 28 people dead. After his arrival, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s Dheisheh refugee camp, where he pledged $ 250,000 in Japanese aid to build a new community center. `` I am fully aware of your indefatigable way of life under the difficult conditions in the refugee camp and of the severe situation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> since last December,'' he told a small group of Dheisheh residents. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will grant another $ 250,000 to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief operations in the territories, he said. After briefly stopping at the Western Wall, the holiest site for Jews in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s old city, Uno held a 50-minute meeting with six <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders at an east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hotel. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Faez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON>, former mayor <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Natsche </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> attended the meeting. The meeting was held behind closed doors, but the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> issued a statement saying they welcomed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s support for an international <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference as well as its call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from the occupied territories. <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> told reporters the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders urged <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> to pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to respond to a document released by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s senior political adviser, <PERSON> Bassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Sherif </PERSON>. The document, publicized this month, proposed negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> toward a two-state solution. `` We asked him to press the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to accept the Abu-Sherif document,'' <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> said. `` We endorse _ every one of us _ the <ORGANIZATION> Abu-Sherif </ORGANIZATION> statement and hope it will convince the Israelis that Palestinians are ready for peace.'' During an afternoon meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> shared his impressions of the difficult living conditions he saw at the refugee camp. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> responded by urging <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to participate in his proposal to revamp the camps and find new housing for the residents, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>.

 A couple who camped in a hospital lounge while their ailing daughter awaited a liver transplant opened a house Sunday to help other families avoid that same ordeal. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> held an open house Sunday at The Family Inn, a renovated structure here with room for 10 families. The families can stay at the house, located near area hospitals, for $ 10 per night. `` The child who is ill is pretty well taken care of,'' <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> said as dozens of neighbors, builders and sponsors of the project toured the rambling home. `` It's the rest of the family that ca n't understand why it's going on It's just overwhelming. If they can come some place, put their feet up and have their families come on weekends, it does n't make it go away but it just puts it in perspective.'' The house has a large kitchen, extra bathrooms, several pay phones, a laundry in the basement and a den with a television. `` I think there's two things we're providing,'' said <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>. `` One of them is a place to stay. Another is contact with other families.'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> had her hands full Sunday making sure daughter <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> did n't make a clean sweep of a cookie tray set out for visitors. Now 6, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> was running, jumping and playing along with other youngsters at the open house. In the fall of 1982 a family in Alpine, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, saw a television report of a speech made by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pediatrician's convention pleading for help. Four days later, the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> family lost their 11-month-old son in an accident. The boy's liver was transplanted into <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> in an operation Nov. 5, 1982, in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> The hospital where the operation took place was, at the time, one of the few in the country that performed the operation. The Fiskes, from <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, spent three months in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The couple spent the first week living in the hospital waiting room. Subsequently, Mrs. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> found a boarding house and her husband visited from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on weekends. Mrs. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> began taking notes of some of the problems she and the family encountered during <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s hospital stay. She said the notes were the beginning of The Family Inn.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> held its first nationwide elections Sunday since the Communists seized power in that <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation 13 years ago, the official Laotian news agency <ORGANIZATION> KPL </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency report, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said voters cast ballots for 4,462 candidates running for 2,410 seat on district-level People's Councils. The district elections are to be followed in mid-November by those at provincial and national levels while village elections are to take place later, according to Laotian officials. The elections appear to be another sign of greater openness in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Over the past year, the government has promoted capitalist-style reforms of the economy and plans to decentralize the bureaucracy. The agency said 1,793,000 eligible voters _ representing 47 percent of the population _ cast secret ballots in the nation's 113 districts. The highest-level elections will be for 79 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed Dec. 2, 1975, and assigned to draft a Constitution and prepare the country for elections.

Real power in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> still rests with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its highest body, the Politburo. The Poliburo is led by <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> <PERSON> Phomvihane </PERSON>, who fought the French colonialists and then led the guerrilla war against the U.S.-backed <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> government that fell in 1975.

 The drought-diminished <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> re-opened to more than 500 barges after a three-day dredging operation, while <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farmers whose cattle had to eat cactus were faced with flash floods after weekend thunderstorms dumped five to 10 inches of rain. The weather cooled dramatically around the southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> but remained hot and humid in the South. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimated Sunday that food prices will increase 2 percent to 4 percent next year because of the drought. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation,'' also said his committee would monitor market activity in farm products Thirty-nine tows pushing the barges on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had been idled by the low water levels but were able to move through the newly dug channel by Saturday midnight, Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> said Sunday. An additional 1,000 barges were reported waiting at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to head down river. At <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the river may fall soon to less than 20 percent of its normal flow. However, both <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> predicted that commercial traffic on the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> will continue through the summer although periodic barge backups and groundings can be expected. Sands and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> toured the area with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for civil works. `` There are problems on the river, but they are manageable,'' Page said. `` We'll keep it open.'' In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, the high temperature failed to clear the 100-degree mark for the first time in eight days Sunday, but drought conditions lingered and people talked more and more about the resemblance to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. <PERSON> Monsigner </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> recalled residents flocking to the air-conditioned Orpheum Theater to avert the heat in the 1930s. He said the summers of 1934 and 1936 were `` scorchers.'' `` I remember we slept on the porch at night to keep cool,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Musser </PERSON>, 79, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, was living in rural <LOCATION> Rising </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1934, when only 14 inches of rain fell in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. It was the lowest annual rainfall since 1864. `` It was hot for weeks at a time. Real hot. Without letting up. It lasted year after year,'' she said. Severe thunderstorms slashed across <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Sunday and caused serious damage in the southeast corner of the state, where two homes were destroyed by what witnesses described as a tornado. Dozens of vehicles were damaged when winds ripped part of the roof off the <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION> airport. Emergency management officials reported no serious injuries from the storm, which provided the second straight day of much-needed rain for some drought-stricken areas. `` The rains -LRB- in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- ... have helped quite a bit,'' particularly in the southeast part of the state, said metereologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast center in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The weather service issued flash flood warnings for Real and <LOCATION> Uvalde </LOCATION> counties near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where three to five inches of rain fell Saturday. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, some rain showers fell across the southern two-thirds of the state Saturday, but <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a deputy meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday the showers did n't amount to much. Although a day of prayer proclaimed for Sunday by Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> did n't produce substantial rain, it did seem to have some effect: `` Attendance is picking up,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehurst </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Weiner </LOCATION>.

 Gay couples marched in matching colors, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s mayor brought his family, and balloons were released to memorialize AIDS deaths as half a million people participated in gay pride celebrations nationally Sunday. Police estimated 100,000 people marched down <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue, stopping for a period of silence as 10,000 balloons bearing messages and poems to people who have died of AIDS were released. Similar balloon releases occurred in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The balloons are symbolic of the freedom we, as homosexuals, have to fly free and be proud of what we are,'' said <PERSON> Kenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, an organizer. About 25 members of three organziations _ Jews for Morality, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent the Spread of AIDS and the Committee for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s _ protested opposite St. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Cathedral, condemning homosexuals and shouting `` AIDS spreaders'' at parade participants In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, about 600 gay activists chanting `` Gay bashing, we say no, homophobia's got to go,'' marched Saturday through downtown to the state Capitol. Activists attributed a bludgeoning death last month to anti-homosexual bias. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s parade attracted several hundred marchers and many more spectators, and ended with a rally that attracted about 70,000, police said. A focus was support of a proposed human rights ordinance approved by a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> committee Thursday that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, martial status, disability or sexual orientation. Church groups have lobbied against it. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was scheduled to speak at the rally but did n't show up. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, three congressional candidates turned out to court about 15,000 people who marched and rallied to cap a Lesbian and Gay Pride Week. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> became the first mayor to take part in the city's annual Gay Freedom Day parade, which drew more than 160,000 marchers and spectators. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> rode with his family in a black 1931 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The parade also featured 175 floats and contingents, escorted by the group <PERSON> Dykes </PERSON> on Bikes, hundreds of leather-clad, motorcycle-revving lesbians. In addition to the traditional sprinkling of female impersonators and leather-clad, buttock-flashing cowboys, there were more serious contingents, such as Living Sober, a group of recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, gay couples wearing matching colors strolled arm-in-arm along the parade route. Drill teams and marching bands entertained 150,000 people in the 19th annual Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Pride Celebration. The parade grew somber as participants released 12,000 purple helium-filled balloons, each bearing the name of a person with AIDS. `` The AIDS crisis has brought together the gay and lesbian communities and has helped bring people out, not just to the festival, but to their families and their friends,'' said organizer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonker </PERSON>. `` I watched in 1982 and I do n't know if there was any AIDS groups present, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnsworth </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, watching the parade there. `` Then last year it seemed so heavy into AIDS, which is valid _ it's important. `` For all the thousands of people marching today in this parade, more than a thousand of them wo n't be here next year,'' he said. The AIDS-related concerns stem from the fatal virus' rampant spread through the male homosexual community. Nationally, 65,099 AIDS cases have been reported since June 1981, resulting in 36,874 deaths.

 The first stone was laid Sunday for a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers who have been killed fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The monument, which includes an eternal flame to the dead, will be built in <LOCATION> Friendship </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a popular spot in the Soviet capital's northwest near the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said It said veterans of the Afghan war sang songs at a ceremony for the laying of the cornerstone Sunday, a day celebrated here as `` Soviet Youth Day.'' The creation of the memorial was a sign that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be increasingly coming to grips with the costs of the war it did not win. During much of the 8 -LCB- - year Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the state-run media and officials made scant mention of Soviet soldiers who had been killed Many of the war dead were buried with no hint on their tombstones of where or why they had died. The Soviets have been more frank about the casualties under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openess. The government disclosed on May 25 that 13,310 Soviet troops had been killed and 35,478 wounded since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. The Kremlin began withdrawing its troops on May 15 under a U.N.-brokered agreement concluded the previous month. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the war monument will be erected to `` Soviet soldiers who died while fulfilling their internationalist duty in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' According to official Soviet thinking, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did not intervene in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but came to the aid of a Marxist government beleaguered by a nationwide insurgency. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that for Sunday's ceremony, a lamp was lit at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin that honors World War II dead, and brought to the spot in Friendship Park where the cornerstone was laid. The lamp will be kept by the state-sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> until the monument is completed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city organization of the military reserve collected donations for the monument and for the construction of a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers wounded in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

The vacancy rate has risen to 40 percent in some of the buildings controlled by gangs, compared with 6 percent at two <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> buildings not dominated by gangs, he said. `` The problem is critical. The more vacancies you have, the more they proliferate. It's like a cancer eating away,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. Cuts in funds, labor and equipment are also to blame for the problem, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and other officials said. But others blamed bureaucratic inefficiency. Former <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> contended that many of the 40,000 people on the waiting lists are dead or ca n't be located. The authority has cut its work force from 2,880 to 1,957 in the last year because of federal cutbacks, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. So, instead of quickly repairing apartments when tenants move out, the authority boards up units, which are often run-down after years of abuse by tenants. But by boarding up the apartments, the authority is telling gangs `` that they can move in and do their number on it,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Famous Divorce Lawyer Blasts Televised Rape Accusation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Divorce lawyer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> on Sunday described two former clients who claimed he raped them as `` professional extortionists'' after they described the alleged attacks on a television program. `` It's ridiculous because I've spent my life defending women, not attacking them. After their complaints were filed, I went and took a lie detector test on both women, and it came out 100 percent that I had had nothing to do with them,'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said. He commented after the CBS program `` 60 Minutes'' featured an investigation that began after <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett-Whitney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> made the allegations against the lawyer. `` These women are charlatans, they can cry on cue,'' he said. `` They know it did n't happen, and I know it did n't happen. They're professional extortionists, that's what you run into in this business When you're a high-profile figure, these people come after you.'' Ms. <PERSON> Barrett-Whitney </PERSON> said she paid <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> $ 25,500 to represent her in a palimony action, only to have him rape her in a bathroom. The CBS program quoted Ms. French as saying she was raped by <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> and another former client as saying he fondled her and took a bubble bath in front of her. Ms. <PERSON> Barrett-Whitney </PERSON> and Ms. French complained to police, who recorded a conversation between <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Barrett-Whitney </PERSON> in which the attorney said, `` I have no bad feelings against you, and I was n't in any way trying to traumatize you,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> report said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said: `` There certainly are things that Mr. <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> says in that tape which make the hair in the back of my neck stand up. I say, you know something, something's cooking here.'' But the district attorney's office decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. The `` 60 Minutes'' report said that when <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> was told about the story, `` he cried and pleaded with us not to air this report,'' offering `` 10 great stories'' if the program dropped the <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> piece. `` I urged them not to do it because it was untrue, but it's a misrepresentation for -LRB- 60 Minutes correspondent -RRB- <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> to say I begged him not to do it,'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office. The lawyer said Ms. <PERSON> Barrett-Whitney </PERSON> has 13 aliases and has filed seven different lawsuits totalling $ 300 million against several professionals, doctors, psychiatrists, lawyers, dentists, `` all claiming the same thing.'' He said Ms. <PERSON> Barrett-Whitney </PERSON> came to him for palimony and later several other suits, but he refused to take the other lawsuits. `` When I refused to take them, then she decided to leave me and claim that I sexually attacked her,'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said. He said Ms. French wanted him to sue a minister for a supposed sexual attack. `` When I found it to be groundless, I said I would n't do it. Even still, she sent me nice letters for months trying to get me to take the case, months after the fictitious attack on her supposedly happened,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A week-old fire along the <LOCATION> Montana-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> border broke away from an army of more than 1,200 firefighters again Sunday and raced northward six or seven miles across thousands of acres of timber, officials reported. Officials were uncertain how many additional acres had burned, but their best estimate was that the fire covered more than 50,000 acres Sunday night in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendley </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Billings, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. Meantime, the number of widespread forest and brush fires continued to run far above average and to concern fire officials across the nation, though some fires were being brought under control. More than 700 acres of drought-seared grassland burned in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. At least 10 people were injured _ one seriously enough to be hospitalized _ and four residences burned before firefighters controlled a 215-acre blaze Saturday in the high desert community of Apple Valley. Aided by overnight rainfall and cooler, humid weather, 200 <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> firefighters controlled the 137-acre Tyndall Meadows fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> and planned to begin demobilizing Monday. In <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, weekend rain also helped to remove the immediate threat of forest fires in some areas, but rangers said Sunday that rainfall was too light to make any difference in most of the state's northern woods. A fire that scorched at least 200 acres in the <LOCATION> Allagash </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was reported under control Sunday, but rangers said lightning posed a constant danger. In the western <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> woods, Assistant Regional <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON> said Saturday's rain removed the danger for a couple of days. `` But with a little bit of sunshine and a little bit of wind, we'll be right back where we were,'' Wing said. Flames from the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> fire came within 300 yards of a ranch near the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> border Saturday night before firefighters and air-dropped flame retardant turned the blaze away, officials said. `` It was very extreme, a pretty tense situation,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravnikar </PERSON>. Fire had burned 39,680 acres as of Sunday morning. So far, firefighting costs have topped $ 900,000 and are expected to reach $ 1.75 million, and timber losses are predicted at $ 2.5 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported 10 to 15 new fires a day last week, compared with the usual two or three a day in June. As of late last week, 556 fires had burned more than 2,200 acres this year in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> firefighters normally battle about 100 fires during June, but so far this month 511 fires have been reported. Approximately eight times as many acres of land have been lost this month as in June 1987. High temperatures, consistently low humidity and windy days have combined to make conditions excellent for fires and only a long, steady rain will make things better, officials said.

 Four steel bins filled with unsold grain are <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>'s hedge against a drought that wiped out his 1,300 acres of wheat, oats and rye this spring. As the drought drags on and grain prices soar, he's one of thousands of farmers who stand to make a tidy profit from selling their share of the billions of bushels of wheat and corn stockpiled around the nation. `` The drought makes it tough going, but, yes, we are going to get along quite comfortably,'' said <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodenburg </PERSON>, 57, has 14,000 bushels of wheat stored in the bins on his 3,000-acre farm. The wheat is worth $ 3.85 a bushel, up $ 1.15 from a few weeks ago. The price likely will rise much more, perhaps as high as $ 7 a bushel, some have speculated.

 Worldwide grain stocks could sink to their lowest levels of the decade and lead to possible food shortages if the crippling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought continues for another two weeks, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization. But officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> say favorable weather and crop prospects have created a brighter farm picture in most of the rest of the world. Before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought took hold, the Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization already was projecting that world grain production in 1988-89 would not match consumption and that stocks would drop close to the level the agency considers the minimum necessary to safeguard world food security. `` Now with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought, the question is how much is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production going to be drawn down,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON>, chief of the agency's global information and early warning service, said in an interview Friday. The organization had projected June that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would produce 279 million tons of this year's targeted 1.67 billion tons of grain worldwide.

 It sounds like grand prize in a supermarket sweepstakes: free cash, land and a year of golf and swimming. What's more, ladies and gentlemen, everybody can be a winner. A too-good-to-be-true offer? No. A gimmick? Yes. The promotion is brought to you by the friendly folks of <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, who hope their slick campaign will entice people to move to a tiny town itching to get bigger. <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON>, which will provide $ 1,200, a free lot and recreation for folks who build and live in a house worth at least $ 30,000, is among a growing number of towns in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> offering incentives to lure new residents or industry. All across the heartland, small towns that have lost people, jobs and schools to the farm crisis are now waging aggressive campaigns in their struggle to expand or at least stay alive. `` Rural communities are fighting for survival,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist. `` It's a very competitive situation we've got out there.'' Some towns make pitches in radio or newspaper ads. Many have hired professionals. All are humming a tune of promises, promises, promises _ low business rents, free buildings, tax breaks, cheap utilities and, in some cases, hard cash. Some towns are angling for jobs. Others want people. Both are important. `` It's kind of a chicken and egg question _ do jobs attract people or do people attract employers who bring jobs?'' <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said. `` It's some of both.'' The increasing number of towns offering incentives, he added, `` reflects the desperate financial situation in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Not all the towns have been ravaged by hard times, but many have seen neighboring communities wither away. They fear unless they move fast, they'll be next. Strategies vary: _ In <LOCATION> Chetek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, population 2,160, a bank is offering a $ 5,000 reward this year to anyone who can bring in a new business that will employ at least 15 people full time `` We're a small town. We're looking for any small employer. We're not trying to recruit a Saturn -LRB- auto -RRB- plant,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Missling </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chetek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is offering the reward. _ In <LOCATION> Rolfe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the incentives include cash, one-year family membership to the pool and golf course and 8.8 percent initial financing `` We feel like we have just about everything we need _ except people,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkleblack </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rolfe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Betterment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. One couple has taken advantage of the offer and a house is under construction, he said _ In <LOCATION> Osakis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, up to $ 5,000 is offered toward the cost of a lot and home for anyone willing to build and stay five years A similar offer is available to businesses. The program is financed with proceeds from the `` pull tab,'' a local instant lottery. `` We do n't want to lose what we've got,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Osakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's sort of a circle-your-wagon defense.'' One couple recently took advantage of the program and built a home in town, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. Officials said since the incentive was announced last fall, about 25 inquiries had come in from as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. _ In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, prospective businesses are being tempted with offers of free land and cheaper rents The town will also offer cash to a company based on the number and skill level of the jobs it brings to town, as long as the company stays 10 years. In the last two years, five manufacturers that will eventually employ up to 630 people have moved to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmutzler </PERSON>, city director of economic development. Another company that will provide 200 new jobs will open in July, he said, and plans in the works could bring 300 more jobs to town by 1990. <PERSON> Schmutzler </PERSON> said special offers are important only after a company has narrowed down possible locations to a few towns. Then, he said, `` it's who wants -LRB- the company -RRB- the most. It's who's offering the biggest incentives. Scores of other rural towns have similar programs, leading some experts to question whether they are giving away the store. `` They feel like they do n't have a chance unless they sell their soul,'' said <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> sociologist. `` They have to offer not just a building, but a building with free taxes. `` Competition is so tough,'' he said, `` if you go 10 miles or 100 miles down the road, there's going to be some other community that's willing to provide -LRB- a company -RRB- with free everything. Unless you offer free everything, you'll lose them.'' The drawback, he said, is `` there's only so many marbles to spread around. There's only so many plants looking for a site.'' And that can pit towns against each other. `` In some ways, it's a zero-sum game,'' said <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> State. `` One community gains at the expense of another.'' But town officials say they carefully analyze the cost-benefit ratio before offering special deals. In <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON>, for example, `` we need new housing,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jochims </PERSON>, city administrator. `` It commits people to our community. ... We get a payback. We get tax dollars and utility dollars.'' The town of 700 has lost about 10 percent of its population since 1980, officials say, and the last new house was built seven years ago. `` We need to offer jobs and housing ... to ensure we're going to be here in the future,'' <PERSON> Jochims </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, federal statistics show, lost 62,000 people from 1980 to 1986. In recruiting, many communities emphasize the <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> aspect of small-town <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, such as low taxes, good schools, little crime. But often, there's one missing piece in the puzzle _ jobs. And no matter what they offer, experts say, remotely located towns are n't likely to attract industry, and without work, there's little reason for people to relocate While many say it's too early to judge the impact of incentives, <LOCATION> Bettendorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, offers an example of where they worked _ too well. Last year, <LOCATION> Bettendorf </LOCATION> had to end its offer to pay up to $ 500 of first-time homebuyers' closing costs when it ran out of money, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvach </PERSON>, planning coordinator. The program's cost: $ 106,000. `` The response was much greater than anticipated,'' <PERSON> Kvach </PERSON> said, and 280 homes were bought and built in 10 months, with about 20 percent of the buyers coming from out of state. Money aside, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said incentives also had intangible value. `` It makes a community feel better,'' he said. `` They're trying to control their own destiny. ... In a few cases, it may succeed.'' But, he added, `` for the great many, my answer would be no.''

<TEXT>
 Negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its two largest unions continued bargaining Sunday over a new contract for 47,000 workers, although no immediate strike was expected if agreement was not reached by a midnight deadline. Negotiators resumed talks at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel, according to <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Borstel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Salaried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 40,000 GE workers. GE's other national contract involves the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 6,300 GE employees. <PERSON> Borstel </PERSON> declined to characterize the tenor of the talks, or to speculate about when agreement might be reached. But <PERSON> Borstel </PERSON> has said that if the talks produced no agreement by the midnight EDT stroke deadline, the union was likely to give the company a 10-day strike notice instead of actually striking. The unions are seeking a moratorium on plant closings, a no-layoffs guarantee, better early retirement benefits, stronger limits on subcontracting and other job security improvements. They also want wage increases in each year of the new contract, improvements in the cost of living formula, increases in pension benefits, improvements in health and hospitalization insurance, reimbursement for dependent care and prepaid prescription drugs.

<HEAD>Survey: First Quarter Industry Profit Concentrated In 10
Investment Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten big investment banks accounted for 43 percent of the securities industry's first quarter profit, indicating the impact of the October market crash still is being felt by most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms, an industry trade group has reported. The industry posted a pre-tax profit of $ 1.1 billion in the first quarter, compared with a $ 2.1 billion loss in fourth quarter 1987 and a $ 2 billion pre-tax profit for all of last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a survey released Monday. Big investment banks constituting 2.5 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> member firms accounted for more than 43 of the industry-wide profit, while just 23 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> firms accounted for 61 percent of the profit, <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> stated. The figures indicated the ripples from the October crash still were being felt mostly by the retail sector, where the bulk of the nation's securities firms are focused, said <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> president, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Industry-wide commission revenue fell by 25 percent, to $ 2.4 billion from $ 3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, for the worst quarterly shjowing since fourth quarter 1985. Mutual fund revenue rose to $ 430 million in the first quarter from $ 360 million in the previous three months, although it was below the 1987 quarterly average of $ 552 million, <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> reported. At the same time, industry-wide trading profit surged 63 percent higher, to $ 3.1 billion from $ 1.9 billion in fourth quarter 1987, while investment profit fell to $ 828 million from $ 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, but remained far over the 1987 quarterly average of $ 17 million. Revenue related to other activitites such as mergers and acquisitions and private stock placements nearly equaled the $ 2.9 billion quarterly average for 1987, the report stated. Those results indicate firms concentrating in investment banking and trading continued to do well, `` while the retail hemisphere has almost ground to a halt,'' the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> stated. The report was included in the group's `` Trends'' publication, which is issued several times a year.

 The foreign ministers of seven leading Latin American nations stated Sunday that the $ 8 billion in outstanding mutual debt among their nations was the main obstacle to creating a regional common market. Foreign ministers of the Group of Eight _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> _ issued a communique at the end of their weekend meeting saying they agreed to work together to find a solution to the problem. Group member <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was absent from the meeting. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was suspended from the group at its last meeting in February, shortly after military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. The ministers, who also spent much of their time working on an agenda for a summit meeting of their presidents later this year, offered no specifics about that meeting. Latin American leaders have talked of a common market for years, but earlier attempts at economic integration have failed. In the 1960s, a Central American Common Market and an 11-nation Latin American Free Trade Association were formed but later broke apart amid civil wars and squabbling over tariffs. Recently, the Group of Eight has been trying to revive the plan, spurned on the economic stagnation blamed in part on the region's massive foreign debts Last year, for example, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> signed accords breaking down trade barriers. `` It is necessary to create mechanisms that will allow the nations of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to develop in the medium - and long-term,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> <PERSON> Olea </PERSON> The ministers also agreed that Latin American nations should take the `` most concerted position possible'' in confronting their international lenders. On Monday, the ministers will meet in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, turning their attention to the problems of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s status in the group They are to meet with President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> and with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sense and Nonsense in the Stock Market</HEAD>

 New evidence has come in lately to buttress the widely espoused belief that the stock market makes no sense. On May 17, the government reported a sharp drop in the trade deficit and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 21.22 points. On June 14, the government reported another sharp drop in the trade deficit and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 25.07 points. At least one large bank ran advertisements noting these divergent performances, and suggested its certificates of deposit as an alternative to stocks for people who wanted investments they could understand. The bank had a point. Any investor with a strong desire for order, simplicity and stability is probably better off avoiding any strategy that depends on the day-to-day fluctuations of the stock market. But to the charge that the market behaves irrationally, its advocates respectfully plead innocent. Though the reasoning may get convoluted at times, they say, there is almost always a method behind the madness portrayed on the ticker tape. In the case of the recent trade reports, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the explanation for the market's differing responses lay not far below the surface. `` In both instances,'' he noted, `` the trade deficit declined significantly. `` However, the decline in the March deficit -LRB- reported in May -RRB- signaled that the economy may be strengthening, and the decline in the April deficit -LRB- reported in June -RRB- signaled that the economy may be weakening. `` The March trade deficit improved because exports surged, suggesting that domestic demand in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, etc., was strengthening and was placing pressure on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers to meet that demand. `` This was viewed by the financial markets as inflationary. `` The April trade deficit improved because imports declined, suggesting that domestic demand in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> was slowing. This suggested inflation may not be as big a problem as it has been made out to be. `` The two events, when taken together and reviewed along with the market's reaction to other recent releases, demonstrate how important it is to the financial markets that the economy slows down from the pace of the prior three quarters.'' In other words, stock traders' reactions to the trade reports were simply a new variation on a theme that has become familiar on Wall Street in the 1980s: `` Good news is bad news,'' and vice versa. Favorable news for near-term business activity conjures up images of increased inflation, rising interest rates and credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, all of which could serve as prelude to a recession. Unfavorable news for near-term business activity evokes visions of reduced inflation, falling interest rates and stimulative credit policy from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, all of which could set the stage for renewed growth later on. Suppose you have worked your way through all this and you still do n't buy it. How could one monthly report on a single aspect of the economy send fears of inflation rippling through the market, and another four weeks later persuade thousands of investors that things were not so bad after all? Well, one could argue, expectations do not really change that radically. When the market rises or falls 20 points as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>, it is actually moving up or down by about 1 percent to adjust for the latest information received. And at the same time, one could acknowledge that this `` adjustment'' process is emotional, messy and sometimes outright violent. Most devotees of the stock market will readily admit to all that. Just do n't try to tell them it is nonsensical.
