 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> blamed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Friday for the stalemate in their year-old peace talks and said if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> does not withdraw from captured territory `` within a reasonable time'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> must consider other, forceful action. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that after more than one year and 15 rounds of U.N.-sponsored talks, virtually no progress has been made since establishment of a cease-fire. He called on the international community and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to put pressure on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to withdraw immediately to international borders and release all prisoners of war, as demanded in a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, he said, is ready to comply fully with all obligations. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in turn, has repeatedly accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of bogging down peace talks. At a summit conference of the non-aligned movement in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, on Sept. 5, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> charged in remarks made to reporters that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejects peace talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday renewed the mandate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping group in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for six more months and called upon both countries to implement the council's peace plan. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to take the very first step in fulfillment of its obligations ... namely, withdrawal from the territory of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has tried to take advantage of illegal occupation of the territory of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for realization of illegitimate and expansionist ambitions for which it launched a war of aggression.'' He said that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` must realize that peace is to the benefit of the two countries and the region. Continuation of the present no-peace-no-war situation can gradually move the region toward resumption of tension,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> welcomes the forthcoming visit of special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliason </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, to both capitals and will continue to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general. `` But if these efforts do not lead within a reasonable time to a change in <LOCATION> iraq </LOCATION>'s stance, other measures must be contemplated,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. Earlier Friday he told a news conference that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would use force to recapture its territory if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> does not withdraw. He was repeating a statement by Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> several weeks ago. In his speech Friday <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also condemned <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons in their war and said any international ban on such weapons, as proposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others, must include strong punitive measures. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said his government was ready to help seek the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> releases billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen since the storming of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> by Iranian radicals in 1979. `` If we can do anything to help any country -LRB- win release of its hostages -RRB-, we do not hesitate,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said in answer to a question. `` But I hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also will take some measures in releasing our frozen assets.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, asked about the relationship between hostages and assets, said: `` It is not our duty to talk about hostages who are kept in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which is another country. Some countries ask us to help about hostages and that is based on reciprocity.'' Sixteen foreign hostages, including eight Americans, are being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalist groups and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is believed to wield influence with them. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted 4 -LCB- years ago. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> emphasized the new Iranian government, believed more pragmatic and intent on economic reconstruction, `` is against any hostage-taking and holding innocent persons hostage.'' For several years, he said, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has exerted considerable effort to help some countries with hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, asked about prospects for better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said that from the beginning of the Iranian revolution in the late 1970s the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has had hostility against us and still continues the same policies.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday rejected former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawsuit seeking reinstatement and more than $ 600,000 in back pay and expenses. The court said it no power to overrule the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> which removed the first-term Republican from office last year when it convicted him on civil impeachment charges he misused money in a state protocol fund and tried to obstruct an investigation. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told a news conference the decision `` invited legislative anarchy.'' He said he might appeal to federal courts but only if he could raise $ 150,000. Otherwise, he said, he'll take his case back to the people in running again for governor next year. `` Justice in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> today can only be found with the people at large, certainly not with the justice system,'' he said, adding, `` This is a war, not a battle.'' Some of the money issues raised in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case are also the subject of a lower court lawsuit, and the justices said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could continue to pursue them there or in the Legislature which can authorize payments itself. His lawyer argued that the protocol fund statute was drafted unconstitutionally and that senators were allowed to vote on the charges without having heard all the evidence or agreeing on what the exact charges were. But the justices said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was free to impeach <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> for his general course of conduct whether or not the conduct violated any particular statute and whether or not the statute was unconstitutional. Because impeachment trials are political in nature, courts have no right to interfere as long as lawmakers follow the few rules for impeachment set forth in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Constitution, they added. Aides to Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, the elected Secretary of State who assumed office after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s ouster on April l4, 1988.

<HEAD>Syrian Shellings Killed Millions of Fish off Christian Enclave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six months of Syrian shellings have killed millions of fish in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off this Christian enclave near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and threatened one of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s few natural resources, a government ecologist says. The shellings stopped with the recent cease-fire in the battle for <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> but damage to the fish population and the livelihoods of local fishermen remain critical. `` Our sea is dying,'' ecologist <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Malichev </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. `` It's become rotten and polluted. Our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next year.'' He estimated that along with the millions of fish killed, billions of their eggs also perished. <PERSON> Malichev </PERSON> said fish not killed by the hundreds of exploding 130mm howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets were poisoned by tetryl, one of the explosive elements in the shells that is released into the water. The shellings also forced most of the enclave's 500 fishermen to remain ashore. But about 75 of them risked going out after dark to gather the thousands of fish that would float up dead on the surface after each shelling. `` After a heavy round of shelling, the dead fish float like a carpet on the surface,'' fishermen <PERSON> Sirop </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornakian </PERSON> said before the cease-fire took effect. `` We usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet. Most times I collect about 25 kilograms -LRB- 55 pounds -RRB- of fish every trip.'' The Syrians shelled the 28-mile coastal enclave and its waters to keep cargo ships and tankers from running a blockade with supplies for the Christian forces of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in the battle of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The shelling has killed our season,'' said <PERSON> Kivork </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoukian </PERSON>, a fisherman for more than 40 years. `` Usually this time of the year is the best for us, when we make some money. But this year's been catastrophic.'' His friend, <PERSON> Arten </PERSON> <PERSON> Khishkhishian </PERSON>, said he gave up fishing because his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of shrapnel littering the shallow waters off <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and the ancient port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> a few miles north. `` I've had to repair my net three times and that cost more than 100,000 pounds -LRB- $ 200 -RRB-,'' he said. `` I decided to stop this ` shrapnel fishing' until there's lasting peace.'' But the others risked their lives and their boats, 15-foot craft powered by outboard motors, to haul in the dead fish. Sometimes a Syrian barrage would come unexpectedly. Police said several fishermen were wounded. <PERSON> Kevork </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoukian </PERSON> said that on one night `` it looked quiet so I dropped my net.'' `` Then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my boat,'' he said. `` I ditched my net and made it for the shore in panic as more shells exploded around me.'' Ornakian and other fishermen went out regularly for catches not much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting. With fish in short supply in the enclave, the price has doubled to the equivalent of about $ 4.50 a pound. Ornakian and the others reckon that the money they made from each trip _ the equivalent in Lebanese pounds of about $ 250 _ was worth the chance. Moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where the Syrians deployed batteries of long-range artillery along the waterfront to shell the Christian coastline. But the Moslems are able to fish south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for 50 miles down the coast to the ancient port of Tyre, where the biggest danger they face is an occasional Israeli gunboat.

<HEAD>Leaked Files Causing Uproar in Northern Ireland</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mysterious rash of leaked security files has led to new accusations that <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s embattled security forces are cooperating with <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> murder squads The British government is embarrassed, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government is expressing dismay, and the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is enjoying a propaganda windfall in its war to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule. Desperate to build credibility with the deeply suspicious <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority, the police force has taken the drastic step of calling in 19 detectives from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to conduct an independent inquiry into the source of the leaks. The affair began Aug. 29, when <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was taken blindfolded to meet four masked men who had files and a videotape to show. The men claimed to belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, a shadowy Protestant organization that specializes in killing Catholics. Four days earlier the group had killed <PERSON> Loughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON>, a 38-year-old Catholic father of four. The masked men said they wanted to convince the reporter that <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON> was on file as an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspect and was not an innocent victim. If, as the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> group claimed, the files came from the security forces, then how did they fall into the hands of an illegal and murderous organization? The furor has worsened in the ensuing weeks as at least eight more security files have surfaced. The files consist mainly of sheets of photos with names and addresses of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects. In the hands of the police or army, the files are routine anti-terrorism documents. In the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group, they are death lists. `` This is an intolerable situation,'' said <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, a leading politician in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who, while consistently critical of the security forces, has in the past urged fellow Catholics to cooperate with police investigations of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> outrages. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing, has long claimed that collusion exists between the security forces and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> groups. <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, who belongs to the more moderate Social Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says the fact that files are leaking out of security bases all over the province points to a widespread problem. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, has published a statement by its chief constable, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Annesley </PERSON>, in all <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s daily newspapers. `` The RUC -LRB- police -RRB- will not tolerate wrongdoing, should it be uncovered in its own ranks, or flinch from tackling it in any other branch of the security forces, or anywhere in society,'' the statement said. Some lists have come to <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, others have gone straight to the media. At least two disappeared from police stations, and two more from bases of the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. In most cases they have been mailed without explanation, but one, sent to a Scottish newspaper, came from a former soldier who said he wanted to show how easy it was to obtain such documents. Another, sent anonymously to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, The Independent, included the names of 25 people living in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. This added a fresh dimension to the controversy because it suggests that intelligence collected by <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> police and shared with colleagues across the border may also be available to the murder squads. Deputy Chief Constable <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the English policeman leading investigations of the leaks, said Thursday that a British soldier serving in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was returned to his former posting in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> after being questioned about leaked intelligence. Details were not available. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also announced his inquiry team of 15 was strengthened to 19. Critics say some of those listed are simply victims of mistaken identity. `` One is a well-known businessman with no connection with subversive activity, and at least six of the addresses published are wrong, which puts the lives of innocent people in jeopardy,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference. The affair reflects the blurred line between law and lawlessness in a province where 20 years of conflict have spawned an array of illegal `` paramilitary'' outfits of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> republicans and Protestants loyal to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Royal Ulster Constabulary knows it can isolate the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> only with the cooperation of Catholics, and it has made strenuous efforts to shed its old sectarian image. Its statistics show that last year, more Protestants than Catholics were charged with murder, even though <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> committed three times more murders. Indeed, one theory holds that the Protestants have chosen to publicize their alleged links with the security forces in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>'s crackdown on their racketeering activities.

<TEXT>
 They no longer wear white uniforms with roses in their lapels, but every litter bit still counts to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s pushcart street sweepers, who pick up where mechanical street sweepers leave off So popular are the 110 men and women who sweep, shovel and spiff up the city's sidewalks and gutters that when one of them takes a vacation or sick leave, it's not unusual for residents to call the city and ask where they are. The city calls them `` hokey men'' _ regardless of their sex _ because of their compact `` hokey carts'' stocked with cleaning tools and paper trash bags. No one seems to remember how the carts got their name. Their job is to tidy the corners and crevices that the street sweepers ca n't reach. They bag autumn leaves, shovel snow and harvest the summer's crop of used Popsicle sticks and other trash. They sweep between parked cars and scoop cigarette butts out of the cracks in the sidewalk. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, which was incorporated in 1796, is by no means spotless, and its age shows in many places. Nevertheless, public works officials in other Eastern cities are envious of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s cleanliness and the attention lavished on its public spaces by the hokey cart operators, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapplin </PERSON>, executive director of the city's Public Works Museum `` It seems in the 20th century that it's a very antique way to do things,'' <PERSON> Kapplin </PERSON> said. `` But it's really the only way to keep the city clean, if you want to do the total job.'' Nowadays, they fill out civil service applications and don fluorescent orange T-shirts or overalls before setting out to erase the evidence of urban carelessness. But a century ago, men had to earn their way into an elite street cleaning corps known formally as the White Wings and informally as the Beauty Squad. `` From the days we were settled and through the 18th century, roving bands of pigs and dogs cleaned the streets. There were n't any government services,'' said <PERSON> Kapplin </PERSON> That was changed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Waring </PERSON>, who became <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s commissioner of street cleaning in 1885 and transformed a menial task into an honorable calling by forming the first refuse patrols, according to museum officials Inspired by <PERSON> Waring </PERSON>'s initiative, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s White Wings were organized about the turn of the century. Each man on the Beauty Squad wore white duck trousers, a white jacket studded with brass buttons and a cork helmet. The $ 5 cost of the uniform came out of the men's $ 10 weekly salaries, according to museum officials. Some men added a natty touch by wearing a rose boutonniere. Sadly, <PERSON> Kapplin </PERSON> said, respect for the elite squad declined around 1920, after the special uniforms wore out and were replaced by drab gray outfits. But the hokey men who evolved carry on the same tradition, he said. `` They're very proud. They're career people.'' Actually, the job is considered an entry-level position, paying a starting wage of $ 7.46 to $ 8.89 an hour. But some of the hokey men like the work so much they never leave it. `` I'm the type of person who likes to work outside. I get to meet people,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, a 16-year hokey veteran. `` To me it's a great job.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Goods </PERSON> has belonged to the group only since last December, but he's already got a pet peeve: `` It bothers me when one car parks with its front end all the way over the sidewalk and you ca n't clean the space.

 A civilian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee dying of cancer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wants to spend his last days in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> where he grew up. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, despite pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a White House aide, refuses to provide an air ambulance ride home. Even if regulations permitted the flight, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says, someone would have to pay for it, and it could cost more than a civilian air ambulance. <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> was in and out of a coma Thursday at his home in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 45 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The 25-year-old native of <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> learned he had an inoperable brain tumor a year ago, just weeks before he was married. He was a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> computer operator for three years, working on such projects as the B-2 stealth bomber at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. In July, doctors estimated he had a few weeks to live. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> wants to die in his home state where most of his friends and relatives live. But the latest estimate from a private air ambulance company is that it would cost $ 29,000 to fly him coast to coast. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, citing regulations, refuses to take on the job. `` I understand their position, that they just ca n't pick up and take anybody,'' <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. `` But by the same token he worked for them. He worked for his country, defending his country and they're not helping him in his time of need.'' Not for lack of influential help have the <ORGANIZATION> Brodys </ORGANIZATION> failed to move the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> off its position. Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., on the powerful Rules Committee, and Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroulas </PERSON>, D-Mass., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, have made Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., has been contacted <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, a native of <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON> and a top aide to White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, has his staff working on the case. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is firm. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunstall </PERSON>, a press spokesman based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> might qualify for an airlift home if his illness were caused by his government work, if the trip were necessary to receive some special medical treatment, or if there were some chance for survival. But even if <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> met those criteria, he would have to pay for the flight and <PERSON> Tunstall </PERSON> estimated the cost at $ 30,000, since it would involve a special trip for a plane stationed in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Only if <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> were a uniformed officer whose medical situation was a life-or-death emergency could <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> be eligible for a free flight, he said. <PERSON> Tunstall </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was sensitive to <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s plight but had to draw the line somewhere on transporting government employees _ particularly when the flight involved costly medical preparations. `` This is n't a greed factor,'' he said. `` It just seems so cold and heartless,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who has been trying to help the <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> family. Mrs. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, 25, said her husband's medical problems began to crop up a few months before they were married, but they went ahead with the ceremony. `` We had planned on getting married and we did n't want to disrupt the event,'' she said. Going to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> also would make her life easier. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> would be able to stay in a hospital for the terminally ill not far from his mother's home. Now, he is bedridden at home and Mrs. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> has had to stop working to care for him. One of the public officials working on the case is <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a client advocate for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Office of Handicapped Affairs. `` His wife is having to cope with the ultimate horror of seeing their joint future destroyed by a cruel death,'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. `` The question I would raise is this: Is elementary compassion too much to ask?''

 Talk-show host <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is about to be married for the third time, but he does n't consider himself a two-time loser _ the losers are those who marry only once, he says. `` We are shocked when people marry several times, but if society would admit it, the truth is that many couples who've been married 50 years probably met other people and were afraid to move on,'' King, 55, writes in the Sept. 29-Oct. 1 issue of `` USA Weekend.

They divorced after having one daughter, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, because `` we really never understood each other.'' He married his second wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, in 1976.

<HEAD>Foreign School Aid Program Has Grown Into `Pork Barrel,' Congressmen
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say it's time to overhaul a $ 35 million grant program which is supposed to help American-sponsored schools and hospitals abroad, but now is a `` foreign affairs pork barrel.'' Their assertion is backed up by internal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> records that show that administration officials routinely bend the rules in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abroad </ORGANIZATION> program in response to pressure from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` My interest is in getting people to rethink the program,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the region where many of the program abuses are occurring `` It's become a kind of foreign affairs pork barrel.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., showed their displeasure with the 28-year-old program by ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which runs it, to withdraw a $ 1.5 million grant intended for an ultra-orthodox Israeli school that trains teachers for other religious schools Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has acknowledged he intervened to help an Israeli school get a grant, but said he now believes the process is out of hand `` The competition has become too fierce,'' he said. `` We now have the undignified prospect of individuals approaching senators and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to lobby for their schools. `` We did not envision this kind of political competition.'' Most of the complaints about political interference involve schools with heavily religious orientations, particularly Jewish institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit last year alleging that the program violated the constitutional separation of church and state. The lawsuit names 20 Roman Catholic and Jewish schools that received grants, most of them because of political pressure. Most ASHA grants remain in line with the program's aim, which is to showcase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> achievements in education and medicine overseas. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, recipients of continuing aid, are often cited as success stories. But the rules for awarding grants state that `` assistance may not be used to train persons for religious pursuits or to construct buildings or other facilities intended for worship or religious instruction.'' Obey, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> ordered AID earlier this month to scotch a $ 1.5 million grant for <ORGANIZATION> Sha'Alvim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and redirect the money to other institutions by Saturday, the end of the fiscal year. The aim of the college, an ultra-orthodox Jewish institution, is to train rabbis and teachers who would work in settlements in areas such as the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Such a goal would be at odds with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, which opposes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s settlement policy in the occupied lands. Despite its apparent ineligibility, the school was put on the `` approved'' grant list after intervention by Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., according to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> records and congressional sources In another case, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belz </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had been turned down for grants almost annually from 1980 through 1984, its request ranked near the bottom of the merit list by independent reviewers. But in 1985, AID administrator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> awarded the school a $ 500,000 grant `` without reference to the results of the FY 1985 review process,'' according to an admission the department filed in the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit. `` The grant was made because Sen. -LRB- <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> strongly expressed the view that the grant should be made and exerted pressure on AID to get it to make the grant,'' the document stated. The grant was approved even though the application had been filed a full year after the deadline, the department said. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which approves money for AID programs, a fact that `` influenced Mr. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>,'' the department said. Telephone calls to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s office were not immediately returned. A spokesman for <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, said the senator was not alone in backing the Sha'Alvim school and said it was unfair to single him out. `` To my knowledge, there was no opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. And he contended <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> was simply supporting the AID administrator's action, rather than influencing it. The program receives requests for as much as three times the amount of aid its budget allows. When projects near the bottom of the list are made eligible through exercise of political might, institutions higher on the list lose out. Among other lawmakers named in the documents as applying pressure to make institutions eligible are Sens. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; and Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> was criticized two years ago when it was revealed he sought to funnel $ 8 million to a French school He was forced to rescind the grant after it generated public controversy. In a letter to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, acting AID administrator, Obey and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> warned they planned to closely monitor the program. `` We ... may well object if changes are not made in the coming year,'' they wrote.

 The fight over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cut in the capital gains tax moves quickly to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and into electoral politics following the president's hard-fought victory in the House. A high-profile <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> effort to derail the tax break, which party leaders called a giveaway to the rich, was beaten 239-190 on Thursday. The Democratic alternative contained a tax increase on the wealthy, and 64 Democrats defected to the president's side. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> victory `` was n't unexpected'' but that he would try to buck <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with an alternative of his own when his committee meets next week. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a longtime supporter of special tax treatment for capital gains earnings, says the nation ca n't afford to give away too many new tax breaks with federal deficits running at $ 130 billion a year. However, others in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were certain to push for the capital gains cut. The <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> plan would restore universally deductible Individual Retirement Accounts, an idea the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats' proposal also embraced. But his plan does n't include their proposal to raise income taxes on the wealthy, who now pay a lower marginal rate than the upper middle class. Setting a lower tax rate for capital gains, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised in his presidential campaign, would reverse what was considered a major achievement of the 1986 tax overhaul supported by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ taxing earned and unearned income at the same rate. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan approved Thursday as part of a huge, 2,000-page budget bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on capital gains from 33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. After that, the rate would rise to 28 percent, but taxes would not be paid on earnings attributable to inflation. `` A lower capital gains rate will reduce the cost of capital and create incentives for investment in the long-term productive capacity of American industry,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in hailing Thursday's vote Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., called the plan `` a $ 25,000-a-year tax cut on average to 375,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families _ the wealthiest families in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ for some decision they already made'' and not for new investment House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the Democrats took the correct position even though they lost and he would continue the fight `` This is not the end of the process. It is the beginning,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the capital gains fight was just one of many in the bill, which will continue to occupy the chamber most of next week. Other, less partisan battles are expected then on whether to repeal the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic illness insurance plan, and on new federal support for child care. Regardless of the eventual fate of the bill, the political implications of the vote will linger. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign organization, said his telephone facsimile machines were humming with press releases tagging any Democrats who supported their party as voting for a tax increase and against jobs and prosperity. `` This is one of those votes that you lie awake waiting for, and we got it,'' he said, adding that it would be brought up again for the 1990 elections. Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said Democrats also gained issues _ the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, the federal deficit and the economy. `` Both parties right now are plowing, fertilizing and seeding the fields'' for next year, he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s powerful victory on the capital gains tax calls into question whether <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and his Democratic leadership team can marshal something more important than personal popularity _ votes. On an issue where the Democrats themselves drew the line in the sand, calling the president's position a gift to his rich friends, 64 of their own members crossed over to the other side. The Democrats gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the votes he needed for his 239-190 win on Thursday. `` It puts a big dent in the leadership's new car,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. `` And you remember that first dent the longest.'' The defections cast doubt on whether <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and his team, who took over just three months ago from their scandal-plagued predecessors, chose the right issue on which to confront <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, since many Democrats were already supporting a capital gains tax cut as a boon to the economy. The vote also raised questions of political lethargy _ whether the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> could have headed off the loss. The process of putting together a Democratic alternative was agonizingly slow and public, completed less than a week before the decisive vote. The alternate proposal to expand <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> included a tax increase. Democrats argued that it applied only to the nation's 600,000 wealthiest taxpayers, but it still was the political equivalent of taping a `` kick me'' sign on Democratic members' backs. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Finance Committee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, steered clear of that one when he raised the idea of reviving universal IRAs as an alternative to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax cut. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s panel begins working on the tax issue next week. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> brushed aside the problems as he met with reporters to analyze the vote, saying he was `` comfortable'' with the outcome. `` I think it is a proud day. I am satisfied we took a correct position,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s Democratic opponents on the vote were quick to express their admiration of him and discomfort with having to go against their leadership. `` I regret it. I've not enjoyed this at all,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who was one of the six Democrats who started the ball rolling by supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Ways and Means Committee. `` I do n't think you can just blame the leadership.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and other Democrats said there was little resemblance in this vote to 1981, when <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> held news conferences to decry their leadership and vote with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Any analogy to 1981, when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic plan with the help of renegade Democratic `` boll weevils,'' has some major weaknesses. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was riding high in the polls then, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now, but seemed to have a greater ability to appeal directly to Americans on teleision. `` I do n't think this is -LRB- because of -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus `` Compared to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, this is not a guy who brings sweat to a brow of a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. ... this is nothing like that.'' But Democrats have to worry, as Republicans were all but gloating over the possibility that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will enjoy a kinder and gentler version of the politics that led to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s big victories. Republican <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the minority whip, was plenty comfortable with that scenario. He declared that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> now has a working majority in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, because the Democratic leadership was representing a liberal wing out of step with most Americans. White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, bubbling after the vote, said that `` if we conduct ourselves well, there's an opportunity to use some elements of the same coalition on other issues.'' Democrats tried to play down that scenario, saying capital gains was an issue where many Democrats had long-fixed feelings that a lower capital gains rate would help boost the economy. But there was almost no evidence that the Democratic leadership had `` gently persuaded,'' in <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s words, any significant number to change their minds and back the party. The complex politics of the Capitol can always produce a silver lining, though. Although <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> fell short, one top <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> aide chuckled that the leadership forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to deliver pork-barrel goodies to many Democrats in order to keep their votes. `` He had to help our guys get re-elected in exchange for his legislative victory,'' he said.

<HEAD>FHA Losses Combine Worst of S&amp;L, HUD Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Massive losses in the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> insurance fund appear to combine the worst of the savings and loan crisis and the federal housing scandal, and taxpayers again may wind up footing the bill, congressional investigators say. The <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> losses _ half of them attributed to fraud and mismanagement _ have swelled the cost of the scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> almost overnight from $ 2.2 billion to $ 6.9 billion, officials said Thursday. The new estimate results from the disclosure that the department's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> mortgage insurance program lost $ 4.2 billion in 1988 alone. `` With the S & amp; Ls, the farm credit system and now <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>, it seems to me there was almost a government meltdown in the 1980s,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, head of a special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> task force on potential fiscal crises, said at a hearing Thursday. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, whose panel is examining taxpayer exposure to abuses in several supposedly fee-based, self-financed government insurance programs, said the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> losses `` combine the worst of the S & amp; L fiasco and the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals.'' `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people again may be left holding the bag for billions of dollars of waste, mismanagement, fraud and abuse,'' he said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said the loss figure was a conservative estimate. `` It sounds like a reasonable estimate to me,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, told the panel. Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> told the panel the chief causes of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> mortgage insurance losses totaling $ 4.2 billion last year were the same as those that set off the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis that will cost taxpayers a minimum of $ 157 billion under a bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month. Some of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically strapped areas of the country being unable to make their house payments, <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. But he said at least half of it was due to mismanagement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, plus fraud and undercapitalization by private insurers who started writing <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> coverage in 1983 under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to privatize the program `` You have to monitor what's happening in the private sector when you delegate to the private sector,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. `` It's just like the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. `` We do n't know what's happening with the programs,'' he said. `` Our budgeting and accounting systems are on a cash basis. So no one has to report a problem until they have to write a check. There's a culture of not bringing up bad news.'' Not that some officials did n't try. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had written several reports on abuses of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs before one last spring grabbed the attention of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee and subsequently the media. Only since 1986, <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said, has <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> modernized its accounting systems enough for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that he heads to even perform an audit of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> programs. Without that modernization, it would have been at least another two years before the $ 4.2 billion losses in 1988 would have surfaced. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said a dozen ongoing audits by his office and more than 600 active investigations into <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> activities `` confirm that many abuses are continuing.'' Despite several changes ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, such as requiring higher down payments and more creditworthiness reviews, he said, `` We continue to uncover schemes to defraud the program.'' About $ 960 million of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loss was attributed to the so-called co-insurance program initiated by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. Basically, it allows private lenders to write <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> insurance coverage for 80 percent of a mortgage, assuming only 20 percent of the risk themselves but collecting large fees up front in the form of points. But because many private lenders have little or no money of their own at risk as capital in the enterprises, the government often gets stuck for the full tab if the borrower defaults. House investigators cited instances of companies writing federally insured mortgages totaling $ 300 million with as little capital as $ 1 million. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is now investigating two of those companies _ <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> _ with losses in the tens of millions of dollars. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he attempted several times to convince former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> officials to establish capital requirements for writers of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> mortgage insurance but was always rebuffed.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> put itself on record early Friday against legislation banning federal financial support for `` obscene'' art, reversing a vote taken two months ago. By 62-35, the lawmakers rejected a non-binding measure that voiced the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s backing for the prohibition. It was the first time senators had been forced to disclose in the record vote their preferences in the issue. The vote was taken after the ban's sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, invited senators to view photographs he brought to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor that he said were obscene. At one point, he said he would seek to have the chamber cleared of `` all the pages, all the staff and all the ladies'' so lawmakers could view the pictures. But he did not follow up and the room was not cleared. Some lawmakers who oppose the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment have been eager to avoid a roll call vote on it, fearing that it could be used against them later. `` What 30-second ad might come out of this?'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said was a popular question among senators `` Senator so-and-so voted for pornography.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> introduced his amendment in July after being angered that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> had paid $ 45,000 for a pair of exhibitions. One included photographs by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> depicting homoerotic acts and the genitalia of children. The other showed a photograph by <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of a crucifix in a jar of urine. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the ban July 26 on a voice vote in a nearly empty chamber, attaching it to the $ 11 billion appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies that carries government arts appropriations. The House never adopted the provision, voting 264-153 against on Sept. 13. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted a cut of $ 45,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, trying to work out a compromise, appear on the verge of watering it down, which angered <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. Friday's vote was on an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill which would have directed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to stand fast for the ban. The amendment would prohibit the use of federal money to exhibit `` obscene or indecent materials, including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts.'' It also bars federal aid for material that `` denigrates'' people based on their religion, race, sex, handicap, age or ethnic origin.

 Hundreds of residents queued up Thursday to apply for money from the largest disaster-relief package ever approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he would tour areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo. As <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s airport reopened for the first time since last week's storm, providing another channel for aid, some officials criticized the government for creating a bottleneck by opening only five <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> centers. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said limiting <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> itself to two <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> offices was `` absolutely ridiculous.'' `` We should have a couple of centers in rural counties. We ought to have several centers in the urban counties,'' he added. In another development, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities early Friday withdrew a report that the bodies of four more victims of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> were found beneath a collapsed house. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON>, night supervisor for the county <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said search dogs had picked up four scents in the fishing village of <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION>, and the state Law Enforcement Division officer near the scene mistakenly reported that as four bodies. `` He misunderstood. It was four contacts. There are no four additional deaths in <LOCATION> McCllellanville </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON>, adding that a dead animal or clothes with human scents could have triggered the dogs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to make a pre-dawn flight on Friday to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, which bore the brunt of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135-mph winds, but he would have to complete his tour by mid-morning in order to leave for <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the White House said. `` We need him to understand how deep the human suffering is in this,'' Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` I want him to know that it's a long haul for us, and it's not a quick fix. As <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s airport reopened for the first time since last week's storm, providing another channel for aid, some officials criticized the government for creating a bottleneck by opening only five <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> centers. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said limiting <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> itself to two <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> offices was `` absolutely ridiculous.'' `` We should have a couple of centers in rural counties. We ought to have several centers in the urban counties,'' he added. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to visit shelters housing those displaced by the storm, urged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` not just come and visit a house or two but to come with a plan and resources.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters `` there is no sense of the massive federal presence that people deserve,'' but praised local residents `` who have the good sense to turn to each other and not on each other.'' Later Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved $ 1.1 billion in emergency aid for victims of Hugo, the largest relief package ever for a natural disaster. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> `` may well be the most damaging one -LRB- hurricane -RRB- in history,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON>. <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said the aid can not go to people insured for home or business losses. The program provides loans up to $ 10,000 for people `` who have needs and can not qualify for -LRB- private -RRB- loans for some reason or other.'' State officials put <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s insured loss at $ 2.5 billion. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may sign the legislation while he is in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` I have never seen so much damage in my life,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, told his colleagues before the vote. `` It looked like there had been a war there. ... We need all the help we can get.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, angrily criticized <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> for opening only five assistance offices, where long lines formed, although 17 counties in the state have been declared federal disaster areas. `` We've got to make sure everything possible has been done at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> level. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is still the bottleneck,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might help cut red tape that is hindering the cleanup, said, `` If there is any _ yes. We'll take a look at that.'' Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>, whose district includes <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, disagreed: `` I detect some partisan politics creeping into the tragedy and that's a shame.'' <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said requests for federal aid must come through the governor's office and `` everything the governor has requested has been dispatched immediately.'' In addition to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit, a congressional delegation led by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., is scheduled to tour <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> on Friday <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, closed since the storm hit, reopened to limited commercial traffic on Thursday. The airport concourses were n't open because of roof damage suffered in the storm. `` It's not pretty but it works,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, which smashed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sept. 21, has been blamed for 29 deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 18 of them in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The storm also killed at least 33 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. An estimated 203,000 utility customers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> remained without power Thursday, more than half in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area. About 50,000 Charleston-area residents had been displaced by the storm, officials said. Even the <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> felt the effects of the electric problems. `` The power comes and goes. I think it is like this throughout the city where there are varying degrees of power,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffennach </PERSON>. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said approximately 1,600 active duty <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> personnel had been detailed to various duties along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to aid in the cleanup. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> committed some 3,925 personnel involved in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, he said, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had some 600 construction specialists in the area with 495 <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> personnel. Supplies, including 5,000 cases of baby food, four tons of pet food and one ton of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> catfish continued to pour into the area. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it had donated $ 42 million to aid victims of Hugo in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the largest relief operation in the organization's history. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it sent a team of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> specialists to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to help deal with restoration of the hundreds of historic structures damaged or destroyed by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. Almost 18,000 miles of roads in the state were damaged or covered by debris, said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Highway Department Executive Director J.G. <PERSON> Rideoutte </PERSON> said it could take 18 months to clean the roads.

<HEAD>Patients Might Benefit From Switch in High Blood Pressure Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A study showing that certain high blood pressure drugs may increase the risk of a heart attack suggests that some patients might be better off with other drugs, doctors say. The study reported Thursday found that diuretics, used by 15 million Americans with high blood pressure, may increase the risk of a heart attack by raising levels of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood and by interfering with the body's use of insulin and sugar. Previous studies had found that while diuretics lower blood pressure, they do not lower the risk of a heart attack. Attempts to explain that phenomenon focused on the effect of diuretics on insulin and blood fats. The new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollare </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithell </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Uppsala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, involved making detailed measurements of insulin and sugar in 50 patients over three years. It is the first to provide definitive evidence that the diuretics interfere with insulin use and increase blood fats, the authors said. The study was praised by Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON>, head of the preventive medicine department at Rush Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a former president of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> `` I think it's a major study, because it gives us additional evidence for what many of us have suspected for a long time,'' he said. <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON> said patients taking diuretics should not insist that they be taken off the drugs. `` We do n't want panic,'' he said. But `` everybody ought to ask how their doctors view the data'' in the study. The study was of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide. It is widely sold in generic form under that name, and it is also contained in such brand name products as Dyazide, the best-selling diuretic. Dyazide's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, issued a statement emphasizing that Dyazide contains an additional drug that could ameliorate some of the effects noted in the study. The statement also said long-term studies found that the effects cited in the new study do not last more than a year. The study found that another high blood pressure drug, called captopril, produced beneficial changes in insulin and sugar use and had no effect on blood cholesterol and triglycerides. Captopril is one of a class of high blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or ACE inhibitors. It is made by the <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which held a news conference Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to publicize the study. Squibb's Swedish affiliate contributed some of the financial support for the study The two other principal classes of high blood pressure drugs, in addition to diuretics and ACE inhibitors, are calcium-channel blockers and beta blockers. In studies published in the last few months, <PERSON> Pollare </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lithell </PERSON> have shown that beta blockers have an even more deleterious effect than diuretics on insulin, sugar and blood fats. Calcium-channel blockers had no effect on insulin, sugar or fats, they found.

 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators struck a bargain Thursday to delay preliminary work for offshore oil and gas exploration off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, a compromise between energy interests and drilling opponents. The two sides agreed to a five-month halt next year in many preliminary activities. In effect, the deal gives drilling foes five more months to continue their efforts to block production. The provision is slated to become part of a compromise $ 11 billion spending bill for federal land and cultural programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies during the fiscal year beginning Sunday. Bargainers from the two houses hoped to complete their work on the bill Friday. Negotiators also adopted provisions to forbid lobbyists who help clients gain federal aid to be paid with federal dollars they obtain. Those lobbyists would also generally be required to file public reports on their activities with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also rejected an amendment that would have directed conferees to stand fast on a ban of financial support for `` obscene'' art. The 62-35 vote early Friday reversed a vote taken two months ago on the amendment introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N.C. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> introduced the measure in July after being angered that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> had paid $ 45,000 for a pair of exhibitions. One included photographs by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> depicting homoerotic acts and the genitalia of children, while the other showed a photograph by <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of a crucifix in a jar of urine. The House never adopted a ban on so-called obscene art, voting 264-153 against on Sept. 13 and instead voting to cut $ 45,000 for the Endowment. As has been routine since the early 1980s, the legislation imposes another one-year moratorium on leasing and drilling in federal waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and much of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. The five-month delay in pre-leasing activities is favored by drilling opponents, who say it would help postpone drilling if the moratorium were ever lifted. Those activities include such work as studies on how the environment would be effected by the work, and public hearings. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had earlier approved a one-year restrictions on pre-lease activities, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had no such provision. The issue has been an important one in environmentally conscious <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, even before the March Exxon Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> that aroused additional public concern. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has imposed a delay on lease sales off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> until Jan. 1, when a task force he appointed is due to report. Under the agreement reached Thursday, pre-lease activities _ short of the release of a preliminary environmental impact study _ could not proceed until five months after that task force report is ready. `` This will allow time for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to digest the report,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, R-Calif., who pressed for the delay The lobbying restrictions, sponsored by <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, were weakened somewhat from their original Violations would be punishable by fines of from $ 10,000 to $ 100,000, instead of the $ 100,000 <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had sought. And reporting requirements, which <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> proposed applying to all lobbyists seeking federal money, would only apply to those whose contracts exceed $ 100,000. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be allowed to waive the provisions. Negotiators on the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment remained at odds over whether standards attempting to describe what constitutes obscene art should be enacted into law while a commission studies the issue.

 Finance officials from 152 nations are heading home with progress _ but no final decisions _ on whether to boost <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s standing in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and while increasing the fund's resources. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> central bank chief who serves as managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, is urging that the fund's resources, called quotas, be doubled from $ 120 billion to $ 240 billion The increase is needed, he argued, to meet the agency's growing responsibilities in the 1990s, including aiding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s strategy to reduce the Third World's crushing debt burden and helping Eastern European nations convert their economies from state control to free enterprise. Also discussed during the three-day annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, were world environmental problems and efforts by the major industrial nations to stabilize their currencies' exchange rates. Both organizations, headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were founded after World War II to promote economic growth and stability. On Thursday, after the closing session, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> expressed confidence that agreement can be reached on a quota increase by the end of the year. Nineteen members of the fund's 22-member executive board support a quota increase of 67 percent or more, he said. But <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which holds veto power on the question, have yet to sign on. Quotas are supplied from member nations' reserves and can be withdrawn at any time. An increase would not add to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the organizations, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> must have adequate resources to fulfill its critical role'' and pledged to work on reaching a decision by the end of the year. However, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials say the administration remains unconvinced that <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> needs as much as its leaders are requesting. Complicating the debate are touchy questions of national prestige for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' closest allies. In exchange for contributing reserves, each nation receives a commensurate share of voting power in the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has expressed a willingness to recycle more of the revenue from its huge trade surplus through the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, but only in exchange for more influence in the organization. It already holds the No. 2 slot in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and wants to vault from fifth to second in the fund, behind only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in voting power. That would displace <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which despite the efforts of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has fallen behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as a world economic power. Delegates said a compromise is emerging that would permit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to share the second slot, while <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would share the fourth position. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is seeking a replenishment of the bank's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which makes low-interest loans to the world's poorest nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the lone holdout among 34 nations over providing $ 14.5 billion for three years worth of loans, in part because its share of $ 3.2 billion would add to the budget deficit, unlike an increase in <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> quotas. In other developments at the meetings: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other Western leaders warmly encouraged Polish Finance Minister <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON>'s efforts to secure aid in his country's historic conversion of its economy from communism to capitalism However, they withheld promising specific amounts until <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> agrees to a program of economic reforms with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said that could come in as soon as two months. _ The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday granted <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s third largest debtor, a $ 1.4 billion stabilization loan in reward for economic reforms instituted by its new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> However, moves last week by three large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks to add to loan loss reserves for developing country debt raised concern among delegates that banks would be unwilling to follow the write offs with enough new lending to keep the borrowing countries growing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> and other officials used the meetings as an occasion to urge bankers to continue to lend. _ <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ announced an accord on exchange rates The group's central banks, starting Monday, intervened vigorously in currency markets, driving the dollar's value down. The effort was aimed at reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and the German and Japanese trade surpluses.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says he is hopeful <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> will start negotiations on the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would bring to the talks a plan by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for holding elections in the territories. The Palestinians, he said, would bring a 10-point election formula proposed by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stressed at a news conference Thursday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal and views <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s as `` simply a means of trying to assist to get the parties to the table.'' He said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10 points were not intended as a substitute for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections to choose Palestinians for negotiations. However, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not explain how the two ideas could be meshed. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has described the <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> formula as a prescription for Israeli surrender. It calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to commit itself to giving up territory and to dealing in the negotiations with Palestinians deported during the 22-month uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> discussed the two approaches in a three-way meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. Afterward, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters they had `` a good discussion'' and `` there may be some potential for progress.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was cautious. `` We really will not know'' until key members of the Israeli Cabinet meet in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> next Wednesday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

 Teacher union leader <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> has a thought-provoking way of looking at the monumental chore left by the historic two-day education summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors. `` I think you have to view this like trying to find a cure for a disease,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't know exactly'' what may work `` but you know that if you provide the right resources, give people the right incentives, you know that over a period of time they will.'' The nation will see results from the summit in five to 10 years, he said, warning, `` Anybody who thinks that with 40 million kids and 2 -LCB- million teachers you can turn the system around in one or two years is foolish.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the governors met for two days at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> to hammer out a process intended to result in the entire nation _ teachers, parents, school boards, administrators, businessmen, politicians _ setting national goals on what children should learn and when, where they should learn it and what type of people should teach them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could n't have provided a better setting, drawing the state chief executives to the placid, picturesque <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s school. He courted them royally, wining and dining them in <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s home, perched on a mountaintop with a breathtaking view. But he declined pleas for more federal money for public schools. Administration officials indicate that extra help probably will come once the goals are settled, possibly in the form of loosening the red tape normally attached with federal school funds. Some governors, particularly Democrats, who had earlier said they wanted more federal money, walked away instead with a list of goals with no funds attached. However, the governors succeeded in pressing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a greater commitment to one day making the Head Start program available to more disadvantaged preschoolers _ a stronger statement than he earlier indicated he was willing to make. Lofty goals and education reform ideas are nothing new for the nation's governors, many of whom already have embarked on ambitious programs to improve the education system. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> outlined a five-year agenda on education, and each year since then the governors have reported their states' progress. `` Certainly this is n't the kind of issue that's going to be resolved even by something as historic as this education summit ordered by the president,'' said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>. `` For many of us, legitimizing the reform agenda and putting sort of the White House ` Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' on the reform agenda is a plus.'' <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said each governor is expected to work with the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION>'s education task force to develop the A preliminary report, complete with timetables, should be completed by the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION>'s February meeting, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been invited to attend, <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> puts it, `` We need the right step to define the goals. If you get the wrong goals and the wrong measurements, this will all turn into a pile of garbage because whatever they decide are goals everybody -LRB- has -RRB- got to be doing, so they better be right.'' The summit, said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, `` is the major turning point. I think they discussed the right issues and they came up with the right answers.'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the governors need to assess the efforts that already are going on in individual school districts. Then, leaders can focus on worthwhile goals and toss out the trendy solutions. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> is convinced some results _ the intangible ones _ will be evident shortly. `` I think you'll see attitudes change. I think you're going to see cooperation,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. `` In that sense, I think you are going to see it right away. `` But to restructure education and to redefine goals, it's going to be an ongoing thing. It's going to take a lot to do that because our educational system in this country, to a great extent has not changed that much while the world has changed ... `` Fifteen, 20 years ago we were n't dealing in an international marketplace. We are today,'' he said. `` We used to compete amongst ourselves. Now we are competing with the world.''

 <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> was amazed when police told him they had recovered his son's three-speed bicycle, which was stolen 10 years ago. His amazement grew when he tried to get it back. In 1979, he bought the bike for his son, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON>, then 14. It soon was stolen from his yard, and when police did n't locate it immediately, Snow figured it was gone for good. But police called to tell him the bike was found Aug. 31. They had traced a registration sticker to Snow. Police said, however, that it would take 30 days to turn over the bike. It turned out the bike had been stolen that month from a 16-year-old boy. The boy said he bought the bike from someone out of town. A sheriff's deputy looked for the seller, but could n't find him. Authorities then decided to return the bike to the boy. `` That made me very unhappy,'' Snow said. Police said the boy had ownership rights because he paid $ 15 for it, and that if Snow wanted the bike he would have to buy it back. `` I did n't think that was right. That's when I contacted the city law director's office. Our whole family went up _ my wife, myself and my son _ and we gave written statements about the bicycle.'' Law Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> eventually decided that the evidence made Snow the owner.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in restoring $ 600 million to <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to strengthen its negotiating position with a Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> looking to slash funds from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s missile defense shield. `` It's a bargaining strategy for the conference,'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reversed field Thursday and restored two-thirds of the money it had cut for Star Wars `` It does n't represent an increase in support for Star Wars,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. The dramatic 53-47 vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, commonly known as Star Wars, was capped by final passage early today of the $ 288 billion military spending bill. The vote on the overall bill was 96-2 with Sens. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, voting against the legislation and <PERSON> Sens </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>., not voting The spending bill, adopted after four days of debate, includes the following provisions: _ Elimination of all $ 1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident 2 missile but an increase of $ 70 million to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 216 million for research and development of the submarine-launched weapon The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action came more than one month after a Trident 2 missile exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. _ Endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 1.1 billion for the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile and $ 100 million for the single-warhead, Midgetman missile _ General approval of the B-2 stealth bomber, the bat-winged aircraft considered the most expensive in history at $ 530 million a copy _ Endorsement of a plan to shut down 86 domestic military bases and scale down five more _ Funding of $ 255 million for research and development on the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sought to cancel House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members will meet in conference next week to thrash out a final version of the appropriations bill. On Star Wars, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a total of $ 4.3 billion and gave members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> more room to maneuver in talks with the House. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, in approving its authorization bill last month, approved $ 4.5 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted a funding level of $ 3.1 billion. Lack of progress on a final version gave way to confident <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members indicating Thursday morning that they would not accept a Star Wars funding level higher than $ 3.5 billion. Their argument: The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote Tuesday night in which the chamber slashed $ 900 million from the missile defense shield. `` It shot a hole in the poor <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> position. Take that, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would not stand for having his bargaining position undercut. He easily gained the support of the key Republicans, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and took his case to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am not a cheerleader for SDI. I always voted to cut some of the program,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told his colleagues. `` But I also felt it was a valuable research program.'' `` We're not going to negotiate between $ 3.7 billion and $ 2.8 billion. Where does that leave us?'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` Maybe we'll sit here until Thanksgiving. Maybe we'll do that. ... I'm convinced the only way to do it is to send a signal to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., questioned whether senators really believe the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` weak-willed and weak-minded'' and would n't know `` what's going on here. However, the amendment prevailed and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on the authorization bill laid claim to what they believe is a stronger hand in the conference. `` Once we determined the conference depended on it -LRB- Star Wars -RRB-, the strength developed,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's cyclical. We're concluding this day on a high note. But there was a note of dissent from some lawmakers. `` Part of the bargaining strategy was a close <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote for improving our bargaining position. Whether it succeeds remains to be seen,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and SDI supporter who noted that congressmen wo n't be `` fooled over there.

 Conservative civil rights activists agree with one of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s criticisms of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s civil rights record: he's said the right things, so far, but has n't done `` Here we are almost a year into it and it's not very clear what direction they are going to take,'' <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Landmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` What I have not seen in the area of empowerment -LRB- of minorities -RRB- is much beyond rhetoric,'' he added. `` There seems to be a duality of purpose. I have seen the right rhetoric, some inconsistent actions, and not enough action,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, agreed: `` I am not exactly sure if I can tell you exactly where they stand on civil rights. I call it schizophrenia,'' he said. The remarks were similar to what Urban League officials said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the league's annual conference Aug. 8 that his administration is `` committed to reaching out to minorities, to striking down barriers to free and open access.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, the president of the league, said after the president's speech, `` He is saying the right things. Now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the right things.'' And <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, commented, `` We have heard Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> say the right words; now he must turn on the music and dance.'' Despite the comments, the conservatives and the orthodox civil rights leaders have sharply differing agendas. The Urban League members back traditional affirmative action programs, are dismayed by recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions eroding the programs and are backing legislation to overturn those decisions. The conservatives oppose the affirmative action programs as reverse discrimination, are delighted by the high court's rulings and are gearing up to fight the remedial legislation proposed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that I am talking about something very different than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and his folks are talking about,'' said <PERSON> Bolick </PERSON>. `` When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to the Urban League he gave a very different message than they were used to hearing,'' he said. `` So far, the rhetoric is solidly on our side of the equation. I do n't know whether those subtle nuances are not being grasped by the other side or whether I am being naive about exactly what they are saying.'' In any event, he said, the administration should more aggressively defend the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decisions. In its last session, the court struck down a 30 percent minority set-aside requirement for government contracts in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, stiffened the requirements for statistical proof in job discrimination cases and held that settlements in such cases can be challenged later by employees who were not a party to it. Bills have been introduced to reverse some of the effects of those decisions. `` The day these bills were introduced, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should have introduced legislation dealing with some of the issues or at least establishing a commission to recommend such legislation,'' <PERSON> Bolick </PERSON> said. `` Thus far the administration is fighting a purely defensive battle, which is exactly the trap the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration fell into.'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> added, `` We see the president affirming the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions _ at least to the extent that he does not favor remedial legislation _ and at the same time the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is filing a brief in support of a racial set-aside program.'' `` This sort of attempt to square the circle only inspires the president's enemies and cools the ardor of his supporters,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> leader said. <PERSON> Bolick </PERSON> said the administration should push for `` a refocusing of affirmative action away from quotas and toward investment in human capital development,'' more black entrepreneurial opportunity, free choice for parents among schools, getting people off welfare, and promoting `` freedom from crime.''

<TEXT>
 The partisan dispute over funding for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> is putting a crack in the consensus for major legislation to guarantee the rights of the disabled. The dispute arose Thursday in a hearing of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> transportation subcommittee studying the impact of the proposed Americans With Disabilities Act on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation, endorsed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and already passed this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, includes provisions guaranteeing the disabled access to rail transportation. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> would have to spend millions of dollars to comply with the act. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, however, wants to end federal subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't agree to make <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> accessible -LRB- to the disabled -RRB- if there's no <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>,'' subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Calkins </PERSON> of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> with Disabilities. <PERSON> Calkins </PERSON> had told the subcommittee that the cost of adding accessibility is secondary to assuring the civil rights of the country's 43 million disabled. `` You are lecturing us about money, which we would want to provide, but the administration says it will veto the money if we provide the money,'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will probably pass the bill `` along the lines of saying how do to it and then not pay for it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have passed separate bills giving <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> $ 615 million for fiscal 1990, with $ 85 million for capital improvements. The administration wants to eliminate subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, saying it serves less than one-half of 1 percent of all intercity travel. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the subcommittee it will cost $ 52 million over 20 years to modify stations under the act. That includes costs to meet access requirements mandated by the overlapping Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> says that low subsidies during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have hindered its ability to meet those requirements.

 The federal government is losing ground in its program to clean up the nation's most dangerous hazardous waste dumps. In eight years cleanup work has been completed on only about three dozen sites, and on Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> added 93 new properties in 32 states that need to be cleared of hazardous waste and debris. The additional sites bring to 1,194 the waste dumps scheduled to be decontaminated under the Superfund program, which is aimed at dealing with the nation's most hazardous waste problems. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the program likely will cost tens of billions of dollars and take decades. The national priority list for cleanup projects would have grown even more, except for a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to also delete 31 sites that had been on the list. Of the 31 sites, 27 are to be shifted to another cleanup program within the agency. Cleanup activities were to continue at those 27 sites, but not under the Superfund program, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mears </PERSON>. The other four sites were deleted because the health risks associated with them no longer were considered sufficient to meet the Superfund criteria, said Ms. <PERSON> Mears </PERSON>. The national priority list represents the worst of an estimated 30,000 hazardous waste dumps in need of treatment nationwide. Since 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated more than $ 8 billion for removal of toxic and radioactive materials from contaminated sites under the Superfund program. Earlier this month, a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the Superfund program has been `` superslow'' in dealing with the toxic waste dump problem and that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has not been aggressive enough in getting polluters to pay for the cleanup. During the program's first eight years, cleanup was finished at only 34 of the 1,175 sites on the priority list at the time of the study, the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> analysis said. The report also criticized the agency for not spending more of the money provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has acknowledged that work has been completed at only a small number of Superfund sites, but maintains the number does not reflect the overall progress that has been made in the program. At many sites, substantial work has been completed and in many cases the most severe health threats have been mitigated or even eliminated, although work technically has not been finished, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials maintain. The additional target locations for cleanup announced Thursday were spread over 32 states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Sixteen of the additional sites were in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, nine in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and seven in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Among the new sites were 11 federal facilities including the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and four nuclear weapons plants near <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. These facilities joined 52 other military installations, nuclear fuel processing plants and other federal facilities already on the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> priority cleanup list. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> recently announced plans to put greater emphasis on getting polluters to pay for cleanup projects through civil suits and a threat of penalties. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Superfund subcommittee and a frequent critic of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the cleanup program, said the announcement that additional sites had been put on the priority list `` marks an important step forward in getting these sites cleaned up.'' Overall, he added, the program continues to have problems.

 Coastal property owners in this hurricane-scarred state are being told a tough new conservation law wo n't necessarily keep them from rebuilding on the water's edge. `` We do n't want people to panic,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are calling us, asking if all of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> will be affected by the law and it will not be.'' The 18-member council administers the controversial Beachfront Management Act, passed last year in response to an accelerating erosion problem blamed on overdevelopment of the state's coastline. The law, which took effect in July 1988, bans new construction within a so-called `` dead zone'' extending inland 20 feet from an established dune line, and prohibits the rebuilding of any home or hotel in the zone that suffers more than two-thirds damage. The controversial law was already under challenge before Hurricane Hugo hit last week. Homeowners on <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> had filed suit in federal court and the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a revision giving the council more latitude to permit rebuilding within the dead zone. The House has not given its approval. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> cut a swath of destruction along more than half of the state's 187-mile coastline last week, and hundreds of coastal property owners are worried they wo n't be able to rebuild. The council met Thursday to streamline recovery efforts. Owners of damaged buildings, seawalls and docks will receive a construction permit without having to file for individual permission. Those who must rebuild will have to apply for special permission. The council also agreed to permit hotels to rebuild oceanfront swimming pools damaged or destroyed by the storm and reallocated $ 10 million distributed before <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> to refurbish the state's beaches; <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> officials returned $ 6.25 million allocated to them before the storm, which left their beaches largely unscathed State tourist industry offficials were urging quick action to get beach resort areas back in shape for next year's season. `` We represent a large part of the state's Golden Goose,'' said <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON>. `` We need to get to business yesterday.'' While there are no estimates available on the number of beach properties destroyed by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, a survey taken before the storm found that only 200 owners did not have enough property to rebuild their structures by moving them several feet inland. The other 700 structures in the survey were on lots big enough for the owners to move them outside the `` dead zone.'' Beam also said the two-thirds damage clause will be liberally interpreted. `` There will be some losses, but a house will have to be in bad shape to be considered two-thirds destroyed,'' he said. `` I believe there will be many buildings that may be condemned by local standards that will not be considered beyond repair by us.'' Under the council's regulations, even homes lifted off foundations or pilings can be replaced at their original site.

<HEAD>Measure Would Require Canisters in Autos to Trap Gasoline Vapors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air bill now includes a requirement for vapor-trapping canisters in cars despite a lawmaker's warning that the devices may be `` motorized bombs.'' The House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee added the provision Thursday in a unanimous voice vote that included the consent of Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> _ the lawmaker who expressed the safety concern. Amendment supporters said the canisters could be made safe. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., agreed only after the panel voted to require consultation by federal officials to ensure the devices are safe before they're installed to trap gasoline fumes The requirement, an effort to reduce cancer risk, would take effect four years after the bill became law and would apply only to cars sold in the most polluted cities. Gasoline vapors have been classified as a probable carcinogen by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, causing an estimated 25 to 75 cancer cases annually. Meanwhile, subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif. negotiated privately with lawmakers to win support for his proposal to toughen <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s standards for auto tailpipe emissions The negotiators were deadlocked over <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s demand for a second phase of emissions reductions early in the next century. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> offered the canister amendment, arguing that `` we have never heard any reputable source actually indicate that on-board canisters present a real safety risk.'' He said the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the Center for Auto Safety, founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, have concluded the technology exists to make the devices safe. The on-board charcoal canisters have long been sought by environmental groups and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> staff _ but were rejected by top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials who write the clean air bill. Some states and cities _ among them <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> _ already have approved another method of capturing the gasoline vapors: special boots on gasoline pumps that include hoses to recycle fumes back to the underground storage tank. Auto industry officials have said the canisters could catch fire after an accident, although there is no hard evidence from test vehicles of that happening. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> warned that the canisters could force motorists `` to ride around in motorized bombs.'' `` If you want to ride around in exploding vehicles, you can support this amendment with enthusiasm,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said as the panel neared the end of its second week of amending the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation. But <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> argued the canisters would reduce emissions more than controls at the gas pump, adding the pump controls cost seven times as much. <ORGANIZATION> Multi-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which studied the canister issue for the domestic and imported auto industries, said the devices would cost an average of $ 83 per car initially and $ 37 per car later _ although amounts would vary with each model. But <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the average cost at about $ 14 per car. The firm concluded that capturing the vapors at the pump would be more effective, because it would take 16 years to implement the canister program. The figure was based on lead time necessary for automakers plus the time needed for older cars to go out of service. White House officials decided to use the gasoline pump controls in its clean air bill and top <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials went along, despite the staff recommendation. `` This is an administration decision,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> assistant administrator for air programs. `` I have no problem with these kinds of tradeoffs.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the auto industry has favored the gas pump controls, which would place the expense on the oil companies and service stations. The oil industry has backed the canisters so that carmakers would bear the expense. The amendment would give the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator a year after the bill's enactment to set standards for light-duty motor vehicles, which could include cars as well as pickup trucks. The canisters would take effect three years after the rules were approved. The systems would have to capture 95 percent of the vapors, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator could waive the requirement once the canisters were in widespread use.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief watchdog is investigating the diversion of hundreds of millions of dollars to other agencies to award defense contracts without competitive bidding. The arrangement, described as a `` money-laundering operation'' by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was detailed Thursday in testimony by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general `` It's not outside of the law. However, it's a procedure that has been undertaken to avoid some of the constraints and the regulations that surround the contracting process,'' said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general. `` It has escalated astronomically since it started,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> cycled $ 200 million through the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s research laboratory at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, for contractors to perform management consulting for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the panel was told The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> transferred another $ 84 million to a Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> program, where contractors hired subcontractors for the same purpose. The inspector general is investigating similar deals involving other federal research centers, operated by private contractors for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaf </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy inspector general `` The system is being abused to avoid the Competition in Contracting Act,'' he said. The Pentagon used the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, known as Fedlink, to award the contracts, under provisions of the Economy in Government Act. The law, intended to avoid costly duplication in procurement, allows one agency to ask another to procure items it needs. <PERSON> Fedlink </PERSON> allows other federal libraries to use the vast resources of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and centralizes procurement for these facilities. `` Then somebody got the bright idea to try to finance the operation of the library by passing this money through the system,'' <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> said. `` The library, of course, kept its 15 percent management fee'' from any money returned to the Pentagon. Private contractors for the Fedlink subcontracted the work for the Pentagon for a fee, he said. `` It gives those individuals in government that have friends or have firms that they know, or have other relationships, it gives them an opportunity to direct a contract to a particular individual or a firm,'' <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> said the investigation so far had not documented any examples of officials personally benefiting from these arrangements. In the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Oak Ridge lab, arranged for subcontracts with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> money transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` It could also be used as a laundering operation to avoid end-of-the-year fiscal restraints,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the panel's chairman said. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> replied that about 40 percent of the money sent through <PERSON> Oak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> was spent at the end of the fiscal year so the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could avoid losing the money. The committee also heard testimony about contract abuse at other agencies. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>, reported that 81 percent of subcontracts were awarded without competitive bidding. <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> said 33 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> subcontracts he audited were overpriced and 12 percent had yielded profits exceeding 100 percent. He said 80 percent of contract abuse he found involved criminal fraud. There were 300 cases of fraud under active investigation, plus another 300 awaiting his staff's attention, <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said private contractors were reimbursed for expenses even when the agency found instances of fraud and abuse.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> should put off development of a new space shuttle rocket and instead try to perfect the rocket now being used for the accelerated space shuttle program, says the head of a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> safety advisory board. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ca n't have it both ways by stepping up shuttle launches with rocket boosters that officials want to be replaced. `` It makes me quite nervous,'' to use old rockets in an intensified program if <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> lacks confidence in them, <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> said. Either the rockets can be used `` or they'd better not fly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has been rebuilding the shuttle program that ground to a halt after the 1986 Challenger disaster. The agency hopes to have as many as 14 annual launches by 1994. The latest shuttles launched are using a redesigned solid rocket motor to propel the booster, which launches the orbiter into space. The design changes were made to correct flaws responsible for the Challenger explosion, which was blamed on problems with the rocket joints. But <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is also committed to developing a so-called advanced solid rocket motor, and over the objections of the safety panel contracted to develop 44 of them at a cost of $ 1.1 billion. The first ones are to be delivered in 1994. The new design emphasizes welds over bolts, allows for mechanical closing of joints and has different seals that permit more visual inspection, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says. Construction of the new rocket would be more automated, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says, leaving less room for human error. `` It is still the number one priority with me,'' said <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> deputy administrator. `` It is the last system that failed. -LRB- When it fails -RRB- it always fails catastrophically.'' <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, speaking to the House Science, Space and Technology science subcommittee, said that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs to have a tried and true shuttle rocket ready for the space station program in 1995 because that new program will rely on the shuttle for construction, supply and operation. <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> said that although the advanced rocket motor may be `` inherently safer,'' it may not be `` realistically safer'' in 1995. By then, he said, the current rocket motor will have had 50 to 75 successful flights.

 The handful of black Americans living in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> experience apartheid uniquely. They feel the personal insult of race discrimination, but they can not share black South Africans' sense of oppression. `` The little things I've been through are nothing compared to growing up in a place like this and being told you're inferior,'' said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. She has worked with church groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for two years. `` Personal discrimination against me is the least of it.

A week later, he joined 15,000 people in an anti-apartheid march through <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` I realized for the first time of my life, I'm a part of the majority _ just by the fact that I'm black. It's an empowering feeling,'' said <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Nealy </PERSON>, 30, who came from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with her family to set up a Church of Christ ministry in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, feels differently. `` Even though blacks are a majority, I feel like a minority,'' she said. `` It's just because of the way people are classified.

And he said he gets angry every time he visits black townships. `` Neither Soweto -LRB- outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> -RRB- nor Crossroads -LRB- a shantytown near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> -RRB- are anything like <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` These ` ghettos' were contrived with forethought. Someone here thought about the worst living conditions you could put black people in, and created them.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nealy </PERSON>, 30, says <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is similar to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 25 years ago, and she worries about street crime. But she and her husband have applied for permanent residence. As soon as their accents reveal their nationality, black Americans may be treated as oddities or celebrities. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>, 26, who is working in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s second-highest court under a research grant from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights institute, says the attention he received as one of only three blacks on the aircraft flying to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was annoying. Miss <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Thunder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, Ont., and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, had wanted to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since she was 13 `` I knew I had to come and live here and experience it as a black person, not just as an observer,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Loyola-Marymount </ORGANIZATION> graduate. But Miss <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, 26, is treated as `` Colored,'' a person of mixed-race, because of her light complexion. `` That to me is most painful, the divide between black and Colored,'' she said. Storekeepers wait on her before South African blacks, `` Coloreds'' tell her they are not black, and black people react warily when she greets them on the street. Mrs. <PERSON> Nealy </PERSON> went to a segregated school in <LOCATION> Lamarque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and her children, 9 and 13, attend a private multiracial school. She said she has difficulty dealing with South African racism. `` I've had to pray about it a lot. ... color is a big issue here,'' she said. `` I guess the freedom to feel at ease, to go different places, I miss that. There's racism in the States as well, but it's very subtle.'' At the same time black South Africans `` seem a bit standoffish at first'' and `` do n't seem to take it too well'' that she and her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, can not speak an African language, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nealy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> say they feel tension, although life seems normal, and they are amazed at the lack of communication and interaction between the races. Everyone interviewed said they had expected more violence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` People in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> think that as the sun sets there are running racial battles in the streets, that most whites are unfeeling ...,'' said <PERSON> Baquet </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` But I'm working with basically white middle-class groups on a project in the tough part of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> trying to open a day care center and rehabilitation center for black children with disabilities,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, who works for <LOCATION> Koinonia </LOCATION>, a church organization that runs programs in which blacks teach whites about social, economic and political issues, said, `` The fact that everything is so well-controlled shows that the state of emergency is so effective.'' <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>, also a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> graduate, from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said he was startled by the lack of knowledge most white people have of black life in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He found being mistaken for a South African black and not understanding local languages can have its advantages. While visiting a small town, he and a friend stopped at a store for directions and cold drinks, and <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> leaned on the counter. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said the white owner, trying to tell him he was lazy, had to repeat the insult in three languages until <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> understood. But the feelings can not always be laughed off, he said. `` It's like an assault on your senses on a daily basis, an assault on your sense of justice, on your sense of humanity,'' said <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>. `` It's not just the big things, when someone says something to you. Sometimes it's just the look in a child's face.''

<HEAD>Butte's Near Bankruptcy Focuses Attention on Counties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Caught between the burgeoning cost of state-mandated social programs and the legacy of the Proposition 13 tax revolt, some officials in rural <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> think bankruptcy may be their only answer. Budget cuts have forced the county to release inmates from overcrowded jails, curtail office hours and cut the sheriff's department in half despite a four-fold increase in the county's Understaffed libraries may have to close soon, but officials have made room in the budget for one new expense _ hiring a team of bankruptcy lawyers. `` We've cut and bled every year and literally dismantled our government until we got to this point,'' says Supervisor <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vercruse </PERSON>. `` At some point, the whole thing starts to melt down,'' county administrator <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said. `` We're there. We're down to that point.'' Many of the state's other 57 counties read their future in the problems of <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, an area 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> rich in gold mining lore, forests and fertile farmland but also home to widespread poverty. `` The danger is that <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is the precursor of all the other counties,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think it's a real danger, a real possibility.'' Counties complain that the state continually shorts them on funding to pay for welfare, health, court and other services they are required to provide, while inflation erodes property tax rates that were frozen by the Proposition 13 taxpayer revolt of 1978. Facing a $ 3 million deficit on its $ 128 million budget, <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> got short-term relief Sept. 18 when Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> agreed to defer a $ 2.8 million billing for fire services. In exchange for the deferment, the county consented to a state audit. But without a long-term solution _ reforms in the funding of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s counties, a state takeover of some county duties, or both _ <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials say they'll have to pay back the state and only be worse off. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has attacked local governments for blaming their budget cuts on the state. Some officials predict the results of the audit will force the state to acknowledge that counties have been chronically underfunded. `` It ca n't be written off to something such as mismanagement or somebody's not doing their job,'' says <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Chartrand </PERSON>, consultant to state Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The counties face `` more and more obligations and not renough revenue,'' <PERSON> Chartrand </PERSON> said. County officials were considering bankruptcy before the fire bill deferment; their decision on whether to declare bankruptcy in the future may hinge on any action the state takes in response to the audit, as well as to possible action by the legislature when it returns from recess in January, officials said. <LOCATION> Oroville </LOCATION>, at the foot of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, was settled by miners in the 1849 Gold Rush and is named after the Spanish word for gold. But it is the lure of cheaper housing that is drawing a new wave of low-income immigrants from cities to <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and other unincorporated areas, swelling welfare rolls and the demand for other services. <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, whose 23 percent property tax rate is the state's second lowest after <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, has been particularly hurt by Proposition 13 Since the initiative's passage, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said, the county's revenues have grown just 26 percent, while inflation has risen 48 percent and costs of mandated programs jumped 261 percent Meanwhile, the county's population of 40,000 has grown to 170,000 and county costs for general assistance welfare grants increased from $ 100,000 a year in 1981-82 to $ 2.4 million this year, he said. The sheriff's department staff has been reduced from 50 patrol officers to 24. With round-the-clock shifts, there are nights where there are only two deputies to patrol the entire county, roughly 2,000 square miles, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said. Jailers must release inmates weekly to meet a court order governing the population of the county's overcrowded jail; five library branches will close Sept. 30 unless volunteers agree to run them, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, said he reached the conclusion in 1985 that his county was dying. `` I've often said, if we were a corporation here, we probably would have filed for Chapter 11 moments after I got on this board, which was 7 -LCB- years ago.''

<HEAD>Senator Calls House Mailing Vote `Flagrant Hypocrisy'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The author of a Senate-passed measure to end free mass mailings for lawmakers says the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is taking a `` deceitful path'' by voting to save the constituent newsletters. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., said Thursday he hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not follow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and reverse a prior vote to virtually eliminate the favorite perk of incumbents The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, reversing a decision it made three days before, voted 274-137 on Thursday for a conference report that would save the mass mailings. The compromise also would cut the frequency of mailings in half _ six to three annually. The House had voted 245-137 Monday to instruct its members of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to back <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s plan to virtually eliminate mass mailings and give the estimated $ 45 million savings to the war on drugs. The conferees, two hours after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote, ignored both that instruction and the 83-8 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote Sept. 7 for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s anti-mail language. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still must approve the compromise and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, heaping scorn on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, urged colleagues not to buckle under. He complained that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members `` in one breath openly voted to ban newsletters, but then with flagrant hypocrisy voted to accept a meaningless compromise that will allow the continued gross abuse'' of the free mail to their constituents. `` I hope and trust the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not follow the same deceitful path of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he added. Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., author of the compromise, said negotiators knew members wanted to save the newsletters and privately thanked him for doing so He said the grateful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members included 14 Republicans who had voted to stop the mailings on Monday. Several House members warned that if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does n't accept the compromise, they would introduce legislation to stop senators from using campaign contributions for office expenses. The House is prohibited by its rules from such use of campaign funds. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., urged members before the vote to end what he called an act of hypocrisy in the House `` If you belong here, you would have guts enough to vote today ... publicly the way you talk privately when the vote machine is turned off,'' Obey said. `` If you ca n't do that you ought to go home and stay home.'' The mailing was part of the appropriations bill that would run congressional operations for fiscal 1990 at a cost of $ 1.9 billion. Of that figure, $ 31.7 million would pay for mailings the remainder of this year. Starting Jan. 1, when the reduced mailings would take effect, the legislation would spend $ 54.5 million for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> mailings _ 65 percent of the total _ and $ 29.3 million for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> mailings. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> mailings would be reduced 32 percent and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 14 percent from original estimates.

 The splinters of what used to be a mahogany altar lay under a gaping hole in the ceiling of the Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a Roman revival structure built in 1815 and slammed by Hurricane Hugo. A big chunk of the roof on the peach-colored church had been peeled away, exposing naked rafters and sending stone supports crashing down on the altar. `` It's just been crushed. You could n't do anything but cry,'' said the Very Rev. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Koscheski </PERSON>, the Episcopal church's dean. The cathedral, adorned with white columns and archways, was one of 20 to 30 historic buildings in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> destroyed or severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph fury on Sept. 21, officials said. With damage to about 75 percent of the 3,500 buildings considered to be of historical significance, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> officials have sent out an SOS to craftsmen around the country, requesting their help in healing a wounded city. `` Other than the loss of life, the real tragedy from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the architectural loss,'' said <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Martz </PERSON>, an architectural historian. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the toll will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and that it would take five years to undo the havoc caused by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds or the rains that fell two days after the storm. `` This city is a national treasure that's been badly hurt. These buildings are the whole flavor of the city. We are wounded,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, `` but we are not dead.'' Some of the structures in this 319-year-old port city date back to the 1690s. The pastel mansions, churches and offices also date from the Federal, Antebellum and Post-Civil War periods. Tourists flock to admire terra-cotta ornaments, delicate iron lacework, cornice details and balustrade railings along with the intricate plasterwork and ornate furnishings inside. One week after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> struck a bulls-eye on <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, crews toiled to cover holes with tarp and plastic or secure loose brick. `` These buildings are like works of art. What the storm did would be the same thing as slashing a painting for crushing a statue,'' <PERSON> Martz </PERSON> said. The city has set up a hotline for suppliers and contractors, and it received 122 calls in a 24-hour period ending Thursday. Artisans from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> have arrived, as have preservationists from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and historical societies in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The city is in dire need of slate for roofs, artisans who can work with mortar originally mixed with horse hair or ashes, and plasterers capable of working intricate patterns. `` Our biggest problem is being able to secure the right craftsmen,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyrick </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. She also urged residents not to settle too quickly with insurance companies who might want to put an asphalt roof instead of a slate one on a damaged building. The city has a strict preservation law that dictates even the pastel colors a house may be painted. `` We've got an outdoor museum here. This is n't tract housing in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wyrick </PERSON> said. `` Preservation is part of the mindset of this city.'' The historic heart of the city sits on a peninsula like a tongue of land sticking out into <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Over 100 of its buildings have survived British occupation during the Revolutionary War, the Union bombardment in the Civil War, earthquakes in 1886 and 1893, fires, tornadoes and now a killer hurricane. `` Hugo was like a malicious vandal,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, the city architect and preservation officer whose 1895 Victorian frame house was squashed into rubble by the storm. `` This town is not immune to destructive forces. This is the most recent and destructive it has ever faced.'' `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> always survives, come hell or high water. Life goes on. We'll come back,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 50, who rode out the storm in a picturesque brick home built in 1840 whose doorway bears an odd angle from the 1886 earthquake. Contributions for the restoration of the historic homes are being accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> Disaster Fund.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reaffirming confidence in Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s fight against drug lords, says he wants to reopen talks on coffee export prices and launch other economic measures to help bolster the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation's economy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Barco on Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to get sufficient economic aid as his embattled government faces up to drug traffickers who have declared all out war, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Barco saw <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House before traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> will head an `` interagency effort to examine urgently what can be done'' on trade relations to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benefits to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, particularly with agricultural and manufactured items, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a written statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told Barco the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will `` work with the international financial institutions to support increased economic assistance for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to resolve `` fundamental problems'' with the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agreement </ORGANIZATION> that led him last week to turn down <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an extension of that pact to benefit Colombian coffee growers, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. At a photo session in the Rose Garden before their 1 -LCB- - hour meeting, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told reporters he was not seeking any more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid beyond the $ 65 million package <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered this summer `` We are not asking for more assistance. We have received ... help with our problem,'' he said without elaboration. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> he would encourage other countries to support <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s efforts against the cocaine cartels. In August, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to sent $ 65 million in military equipment, weapons and supplies to help <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> security forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is requesting some $ 90 million more from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the next fiscal year. Some Colombian officials have criticized the aid package as not suited to their needs. They said they need police equipment to track down the traffickers, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid is primarily military equipment such as helicopters and other troop transport vehicles. Joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the meeting with Barco were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top drug policy advisers: drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, Attorney Gen. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> also met Thursday with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> under tight security at the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. Administration officials previously have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is willing to discuss the coffee import matter, even as he turned down <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s request to reinstate an export quota system that helped Colombian coffee growers `` The president indicated his intention to work closely with President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to expand bilateral trade and investment opportunities in order to spur <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s economic growth,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation International Coffee Agreement collapsed in July after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulled out in a price dispute with coffee-producing nations. The agreement had set quotas for member nations' exports aimed at supporting prices of beans at $ 1.20 per pound or more. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted an increase in export quotas for higher-quality coffees enjoyed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers. Colombian officials have suggested it will be difficult to convince farmers to grow coffee instead of coca, for lucrative cocaine production, if coffee export prices continue to slip. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a letter to <LOCATION> Barco </LOCATION> last week, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready to negotiate for a new quota system but would not adhere to the now-defunct agreement. Barco's visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came against a backdrop of almost daily terrorist bombings attributed to drug lords in his country. Since <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> ordered emergency measures to crack down on the drug traffickers following the Aug. 18 assassination of a leading presidential candidate, police say eight people have been killed and 37 injured in the widespread explosions. Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed in attacks believed carried out by drug traffickers.

 The dollar dropped against the Japanese yen for the fifth-straight day Friday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell moderately. The dollar closed at 139.35 yen, down 1.50 yen from Thursday's close of 140.85 yen After opening at 140.60 yen, the currency ranged between 139.10 yen and 140.75 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 53.22 points, or 0.14 percent, closing the week at 35,634.76. The index gained 319.41 points for a record-high closing of 35,689.98 points Thursday. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's slide to coordinated intervention by the Japanese, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British central banks. They said Friday marked the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s fifth day of dollar-selling intervention in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market since Monday, when central banks from other nations stepped into the market to join in bringing the dollar down.

 <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Boda </PERSON>, who advised <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> for 30 years before leading purges during the Cultural Revolution, has died in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of heart failure, local media reported today. He was 85. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> died at his <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> home on Sept. 20, the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> service and newspapers reported. He was cremated Thursday, they said. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was jailed after his downfall in 1970 for allegedly supporting Defense Minister <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Biao </PERSON> in a power struggle against <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. He spent his last years living with his son in the Chinese capital. In 1980, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was put on trial along with the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION>, the radical leaders of the Cultural Revolution. The man whom the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, dubbed the `` mad persecutor'' was sentenced to 18 years in jail for `` counterrevolutionary activities'' and purging innocent people. Officials disclosed in early 1988 that <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> had been released on probation for medical reasons, but did not say when or give his whereabouts. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> news service, which disclosed <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s death, said he has been out of prison since late 1981 His body was cremated at the Babaoshan crematorium, and about 25 friends as well as his son, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaonong </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lingmei </PERSON>, attended, according to reports. There was no mention of participation by high-level officials. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was born in 1904 in coastal <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1920s. He studied in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for four years, returning in 1930 to teach at <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. When the Japanese occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1937, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> went west to <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>, the remote base of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. He taught at the party school and began his long friendship with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. Over the next decade <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s personal and political secretary, counseled him while he wrote some of his most famous essays and speeches. He played a major role in drafting the new constitution of Communist-ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after 1949 and in 1958 became first editor of the party's ideological journal, the Red Flag. He accompanied <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> on his only foreign trips, his 1949 and 1957 visits to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In 1966 <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> head of a four-member group assigned to lead the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution by mobilizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s masses to denounce alleged `` capitalist roaders'' in the party and purge the nation of bourgeois influences. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> used the post to orchestrate campaigns against top officials, including party General Secretary <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. He was regarded as the fourth most powerful person in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, behind <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s designated successor <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Biao </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. Almost 3,000 people died and 84,000 were persecuted in the factional fighting that followed, according to official figures. He was arrested shortly after an August 1970 party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum at which <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> had, for the first time, publicly criticized his appointed heir, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was closely associated. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was denounced as a member of the `` Lin Biao Clique.'' For the next decade <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was rumored to be dead. He reappeared in 1980, when he was tried with nine others for conspiring with <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> or abusing power during the Cultural Revolution. `` I plead guilty,'' he told the judge. `` I have nothing to say to defend myself.''

<TEXT>
 The foreign minister of communist <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> says his country is ready for democratic reform and and urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to send an envoy for talks on ending the U.S.-backed insurgency. Also Thursday, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> offered to mediate between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and said they could meet on Soviet soil. Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, fighting a deadly war with drug traffickers, today addresses the 44th General Assembly and officials said there would be heavy security. Afghan Foreign Minister in <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> announced that his country's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` has abandoned the monopoly of power'' since the last Soviet troops withdrew in February. `` We are ready to welcome in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> a special envoy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration for a fact-finding mission and for the exchange of views,'' he said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would find <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is ready to institute a `` democratic system based on political pluralism and a free economy,'' <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs the Moslem guerrillas in their 11-year-old war against the communist government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was expected to express gratitude for international aid for his month-old battle against cocaine kingpins while asking for more assistance, particularly economic aid and price supports for coffee and other crops. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent $ 65 million in emergency military aid. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced Wednesday it would also send military and communications equipment. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said he was not looking for more tools to fight drug lords and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said he discussed trade issues. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security officials said protective measures would be tight at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters today for Barco's visit. Since the drug war began in mid-August, traffickers have been blamed for more than 100 bombs in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that killed at least 10 people. The first speaker scheduled today was <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who was expected to discuss his offer to host Israeli-Palestinian talks on ending the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising. At least 575 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died in the Arab revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied territories. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal would have the two sides discuss ways to smooth <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan for elections in the territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> was silent on the Egyptian plan when he spoke to the Assembly on Wednesday <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Thursday with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. Both praised the improvement in <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations but said there were no immediate plans to resume full diplomatic ties, severed by the Soviets 22 years ago during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` I even proposed my good offices to organize such a meeting -LRB- between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on the territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> later told reporters. `` That could be a very good meeting and a sensation for reporters.'' There was no immediate comment from the Israeli side on the Soviet offer. However, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on Thursday formally recognized the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and said at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that it `` respects its right to independent statehood.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> offered his sympathy to strikers who shut the country down for a day over economic austerity measures required by international lenders. But <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> had no choice but to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 26.5 million standby loan. `` We had a knife to our throat,'' <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>. The 24-hour general strike closed all businesses and most factories on Wednesday and paralyzed all public transportation in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> and virtually the entire nation of 6 million. `` The strike was a success,'' <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said. `` I would have gone on strike, too, because I do n't agree with everything they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- demanded. I do n't agree with the Monetary Fund deal. I do n't agree with poverty. I do n't agree with insecurity.'' The strike was called by 32 leftist and conservative political and labor groups and had the tacit support of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrialists </ORGANIZATION>. The groups called for withdrawal of last month's austerity measures, including a tariff increase on imports and a lowering of the ceiling on taxable businesses to include those that earn as little as $ 25,000 a year. The measures were an attempt to increase government revenue, curb a deficit that has reached about $ 60 million this year, and reduce <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s $ 800 million foreign debt _ three times this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation's annual budget. The strikers also demanded a price cut for food staples and respect for human rights.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos Pledges to Return Husband's Body to the Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 From the side of her husband's casket, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pledged to return <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body to his homeland for burial despite <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government orders barring such a move. `` This is so cruel, so inhuman and so immoral,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told reporters Thursday night in the living room of the hillside home where the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president and his wife lived during most of their 3 -LCB- - year exile She said there were no immediate plans for burial, and an aide suggested that, barring their return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' remains might be above ground for a long time <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 72, died Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after nearly 10 months in the hospital. Doctors said kidney and lung failure and a widespread infection contributed to cardiac arrest that caused his death. His successor, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body to return to his homeland for burial in the interest of `` the tranquility of the state and the order of society.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flags flown at half-mast until Sunday on all government buildings out of respect for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Later Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> prohibited any aircraft from flying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' remains out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, saying it would `` create a danger to the safety of the aircraft and the persons involved.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> dismissed that rationale with a gesture toward her husband's open casket in the living room of the family's mansion `` How can you feel this man is dangerous to security when he is resting at peace forever?'' she said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his face clearly visible beneath a pane of glass, was dressed in an off-white Filipino shirt called a barong tagalog. The casket was draped with a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flag, and the presidential seal of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was mounted on the wall behind the casket. About two dozen mourners wept and prayed in the living room. Van loads of flowers arrived throughout the day. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, clad in black, told reporters <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had left his estate to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people. She did not elaborate and attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> would not comment on the bequest. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 60, said she had made no funeral plans. She said she would not consider burying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while she had hope Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would change her mind. `` I have always considered that his wish and every Filipinos' wish is to be laid to rest in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said `` I continue to believe that sooner or later he will be.'' `` Burial in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will be considered like turning off the life support systems,'' family spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyuan </PERSON> said. `` She will decide that at the last minute.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother, who died in May 1988, has been embalmed several times and lies unburied in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was not allowed into the country for her funeral. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ruled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for more than 20 years before being ousted in February 1986 by a popular insurrection that placed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has survived six armed attempts to overthrow it, many by officers formerly loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said she would continue to defend her husband against allegations he stole as much as $ 10 billion from the impoverished archipelago and stashed the money abroad in bank accounts, property and extravagant purchases. `` We are not guilty,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent to federal racketeering charges in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court last October and is free on $ 5 million bail. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' failing health prevented him from being tried. <PERSON> Peyuan </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home would remain open to mourners 24 hours a day until Sunday, then his body will be taken to a local mortuary for viewing through Thursday.

<HEAD>Social Christian Leader Leaves Anti-Sandinista Coalition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leader of the 14-party coalition opposing the sandinista government said he dropped out of the bloc because leftists in the organization want to limit the number of candidates his party can field. Today is the deadline by which candidates must register for the February elections. But 24 hours before the cutoff, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was still debating which parliamentary seats each member party could run for. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the coalition offered his party an unacceptable two candidacies, while the Communist and Socialist parties were offered six seats each. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said his party was the fourth largest vote-getter in the 1984 elections, while the Communists were fifth and the Socialists sixth. `` Leftist parties within coalition have too much influence and great power,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said at the news conference. But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that high-ranking members of <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>'s party denied there was a split in ranks. `` The coalition's political council is in session right now ... and the executive commission of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is in the meeting,'' Union spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> announced his decision. `` They insist that the party as such will maintain itself within coalition and that if <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> is breaking away, he's doing so on his own,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, publisher of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> are the coalition's presidential and vice presidential candidates for the Feb. 25 elections Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> are running against President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has held power for a decade. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> told reporters his party would support <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the presidential candidate of the splinter <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>'s party has six deputies in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and is the third-largest opposition party in the country's single-chamber legislature. The current <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has 96 deputies. According to the Nicaraguan Constitution the Assembly has 90 seats, but defeated presidential candidates are guaranteed one place each and six candidates ran aginst the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 elections. Besides the opposition coalition and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, at least six parties are running presidential candidates in next year's vote. The choice of <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> as the vice presidential candidate four weeks ago created a crisis in the coalition because some parties favored a conservative businessman. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> was eventually accepted, but not before some parties had threatened to break away.

<NOTE>New Bush Steel Plan Is Questioned</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's new steel import restrictions probably will work for a while, but the program may never attain its goal of ending unfair steel trading practices overseas, a labor leader says. The administration is completing hurried negotiations and expects to reach its deadline of having a new steel import restraint program with 29 nations in place by Sunday, a top trade official said Thursday. `` There will be a steel program as of Oct. 1,'' Deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told a conference of steel manufacturers. `` We may have some cleanup to do after Sept. 30, but we will have a new program Oct. 1.'' The program will replace a series of five-year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration steel trade pacts that expire Saturday. The scaled-down <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> version will last 2 -LCB- years. The goal is to give domestic firms continued breathing space from imports by placing new, product-by-product caps on the volume of steel products shipped into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also is asking nations to commit to steps designed to remove government steel subsidies or other free trade barriers by March 31, 1992. Steel labor is backing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program but has expressed doubts about whether a meaningful consensus on free trade can be achieved. `` We have many reservations about whether that's possible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who is not related to his <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration namesake. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the pacts may work for a while, but after they expire, import pressure may again begin to build.

<NOTE>Toy Retailer Voluntarily Recalls Baby Rattles</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major toy retailer is voluntarily recalling 11,000 baby rattles because parts of the toy may become detached and choke young children, a government spokeswoman says. The `` Wooden Shaky Head Rattles'' were sold nationwide for about $ 2 each in 1988 and 1989 by Toys ` R' Us, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The toy consists of a six and one-half inch wooden handle topped with a red, yellow, pink or black head-shaped rattle which has springs hanging from each side. Attached to the springs are two small wooden balls. The rattle `` fails to meet the Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> mandatory standard for rattles that is intended to prevent choking accidents involving young children,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the panel's acting chairman, said Thursday. Consumers should take the rattles away from children and return them to the nearest Toys ` R' Us store for a refund, the commission said. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said there had been no reported injuries associated with the toy but the recall was being made as a preventive action.

<TEXT>
 With former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and others indicted on corruption charges, officials said the task of the conservative-communist governing coalition is complete and new elections will be held. Conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will be dissolved a week from today so elections can take place on Nov. 5. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was indicted Thursday on charges involving an alleged $ 210 million bank embezzlement scandal, and last week on charges he instigated a widespread illegal wiretapping network. The 70-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has denied involvement in both scandals, saying he is the victim of a conspiracy aimed at his `` political annihilation.'' Also Thursday, tens of thousands of people gathered at an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> cathedral for the funeral liturgy of prominent deputy <PERSON> Pavlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakoyannis </PERSON>, a conservative lawmaker gunned down by the leftist November 17 guerrilla group. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party and the Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress took power after June elections left a splintered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. They joined exclusively to prosecute politicians involved in scandals, before new elections for the 300-member one-chamber <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Judicial and parliamentary inquiries have implicated <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, four of his former senior ministers, and about 200 other people. All five will stand trial before a special 13-member high court that will convene by late November, raising the possibility <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> will campaign for office in the coming elections while under indictment.

<HEAD>Plane Touched Down, Rolled Before Smashing Into Trees, Killing 10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSAYAN, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Grand Canyon sightseeing plane that crashed on a landing approach, killing 10 people, touched down hard and scraped its right wing, then veered off and rolled nearly 180 degrees before smashing into a stand of trees, federal officials said. Investigators are checking to see if the crash was related to another landing problem seven months ago in the same aircraft, a de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In that incident, the plane's wing also struck the ground. `` Clearly, as we get further into this and are able to examine whatever other information we can find out about that, that's a possibility, but at this point we have nothing to tie those together,'' <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said Thursday. Preliminary results indicate the plane's two engines were accelerating when the crash occurred, <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said, but he refused to speculate whether the pilot was trying to abort the landing and regain altitude. Weather was not a factor in the crash at the Grand Canyon Airport, he said. Tests of the pilots' blood and fuel analyses were incomplete. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administraton </ORGANIZATION> records show the 14-year-old plane had a problem while landing at the airport on Feb. 27, when it lost directional control and struck a wingtip on the runway. The records said the plane had a `` possible nose-wheel-centering problem.'' No one was injured in the earlier accident, in which wind was listed as a contributing factor, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records. The earlier flight was piloted by a new employee who was being supervised by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sedona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, the pilot killed in Wednesday's crash, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, 47, and copilot <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Kailua-Kona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, were killed along with eight passengers. Three survivors were in serious condition, one was in guarded condition and seven were in stable condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Flagstaff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, about 75 miles away. `` It all happened in a flash,'' said <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON>, who suffered a broken pelvis and a severely bruised right shoulder. Ms. <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON> described how the plane `` shot straight up'' and flipped over. She said she looked out the nearby window and found herself `` in the middle of a pine forest.'' Inside the wreckage, she saw a woman hanging upside down in her seat and other passengers entangled in the debris. `` I crawled as far away as I could,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` And I waited for the medics. I'm sure they got there as fast as they could, but it seemed an eternity.'' <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said the plane was returning to the airport 10 miles south of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> after an aerial tour of the Grand Canyon. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tower had cleared the landing and everything appeared to be normal, <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said. As the plane touched down, however, the right wingtip struck the runway, and the landing was hard enough on the right side to put `` scrub marks'' on the right tire. The craft soared and rolled so that its left wing was nearly vertical to the ground. It struck a stand of ponderosa pine 300 yards off the pavement. <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said transcripts of radio communication between air traffic controllers and the pilot revealed nothing unusual. There were `` a couple of unintelligible transmissions'' after the final clearance to land was given that sound experts were scrutinizing for clues. <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said the engines would be removed and shipped to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> for examination by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, the manufacturer. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> had worked 3 -LCB- years for the airline and logged about 2,000 hours of flight time, <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON> was in his first year with the airline.

<TEXT>
 A rebel offensive this week has left at least 11 people dead, government and rebel sources said. An armed forces communique on Thursday said that in the previous 48 hours, seven rebels and two soldiers were killed while 16 other people were wounded. Two policemen were also killed. Guerrillas on Tuesday began a nationwide military operation, attacking army positions in 10 of the 14 provinces to protest what they say is repression against grassroots movements sympathetic to them. Officials of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government and high-ranking military officers have said the guerrilla offensive endangers a second round of talks between the two sides scheduled for Oct. 16-17. The rebels said their fighters killed or wounded 40 soldiers but did not report their own casualties. In the latest attack, a policeman was fatally shot Thursday while guarding the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the country's federal reserve. Witnesses and police sources said on condition of anonymity that gunmen shot the patrolman, <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>, shortly before midday and fled the scene. Late Wednesday, another patrolman standing guard outside some new high-rise buildings in the capital also was shot dead. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Borga </PERSON> was one of several patrolmen guarding the <LOCATION> Colonia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Militar </LOCATION>, a neighborhood where ranking military officers live. Police sources said unidentified sprayed the policemen with automatic weapons, killing <PERSON> Borga </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebel coalition claimed responsibility for the two police slayings through anonymous telephone calls to news media. The callers did not say why the patrla casualties, three deaths and seven injuries, the army said. It said no soldiers were killed or wounded in that clash. Rebels on Tuesday attacked the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> residence of Col. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, commander of the eastern military zone, wounding the officer's father, the army said. The home is near the civil defense headquarters in the capital's southern suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renderos </ORGANIZATION> Rebels reported attacking civil defense installations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Planes </LOCATION> but did not mention the colonel's house. Rebel reports said four officers and nine soldiers were taken prisoner during attacks on 18 towns. Rebel and government representatives met this month in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to try to negotiate an end to the 10-year-old war in which 70,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians. The talks were the first between the two sides since <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> took office June 1.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, the Soviet-born ballet star, has resigned abruptly as artistic director of the American Ballet Theater in a dispute with the company's management. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> resigned Thursday after the board refused to rescind a decision by the company's new executive director to place an assistant to <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> on a year's leave of absence. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, who defected from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1974, had announced in June he planned to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> ABT </ORGANIZATION> in 1990 to further personal endeavors, including an acting career. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>, the new executive director, said in a letter Wednesday that the former star of the <LOCATION> Sovet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Kirov Ballet gave the company an ultimatum. The dispute also involved financial problems and <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>'s refusal to sponsor fund-raising efforts for the institute, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said today The <ORGANIZATION> ABT </ORGANIZATION> had a $ 1 million operating deficit during the summer, and $ 1.5 million was chopped from the company's budget at Wednesday's board meeting. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, who does not receive a salary at <ORGANIZATION> ABT </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter written Monday by his manager, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, that the removal of his assistant, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> France </PERSON>, infringed on his artistic authority. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has been reported ill. `` If the board sanctions the decision to sever relations with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, then it must realize that <PERSON> Misha </PERSON>'s association with A.B.T will cease as of today,'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said in the letter, referring to <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> by his nickname. Ms. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> said she had asked <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to complete the final year of his contract on leave at full salary and benefits, but he continued to do work for the company. `` This request was totally ignored and he -LRB- <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -RRB- continued to pursue business on behalf of the company which was inconsistent with the artistic and financial planning which I was attempting to implement,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>'s letter said. `` This caused us to work at cross-purposes,'' she said. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> also threatened to withdraw the ballets he staged if the casts he directed during his tenure are not used. `` I'm not taking orders from anyone, especially unfair ones,'' he told the Times in an interview. `` I left one country for those very reasons.''

<TEXT>
 A man who spent 18 months in jail for having illicit sex with his ex-wife is suing for custody of their two sons, claiming she exposed them to bad influences. `` I feel like I can give them a better life, offer them more love and security,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>. `` I do n't want them in any kind of environment that would not be good for them.'' In the lawsuit filed Thursday, <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said his former wife has `` exposed the children to influences which are extremely detrimental to -LRB- their -RRB- well-being and best interest.'' No further details of the lawsuit were immediately available. The children's mother, <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, was awarded custody of their sons when the couple's divorce became final in April 1988. Neither Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> nor her attorney could be reached for comment Thursday. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> originally was charged with rape and sexual assault. He was acquitted of those charges but was found guilty of the lesser charge of oral sodomy under a 156-year-old <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law. He was released Aug. 30 on appeal, and a judge later overturned the conviction. The judge ruled that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s sodomy law can not be applied to consenting married adults. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, a 35-year-old carpenter, has not seen his sons, <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 2, since his imprisonment. He said he will not fight to deny Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> visitation rights. During his trial, <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> testified that he believed his wife had the sexual assault charges filed partly because she wanted to sabotage his plans to seek custody of the boys.

<HEAD>1,600 Soviet Emigrants Enter U.S. in a Single Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The largest group of Jewish refugees to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a single day in more than 40 years landed in time to celebrate the Jewish New Year here. Kennedy International Airport was the scene of emotional reunions Thursday as the Soviet refugees _ including 1,350 Jews and 250 Pentecostal and <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> _ arrived to take advantage of a processing policy that ends at midnight tonight. The agencies that assist Jewish refugees decided to stop the flow early out of respect for <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashanah </LOCATION>, which begins at sundown tonight and ends Sunday. `` <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashanah </PERSON> represents a new beginning for every Jew, but expecially for these people,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Zukerman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, who spent most of the day greeting the new arrivals. `` I dreamed of this day for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Zena </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadelova </PERSON>, as she embraced her four younger brothers, whom she had n't seen in five years. They arrived with 17 other relatives, including wives, children and in-laws. New <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies will mean longer waits for Soviet emigrants at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is allowing record numbers to leave. Last year, 18,965 Jews emigrated, up from 8,155 in 1987. This year that number is expected to near 50,000. Instead of being processed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as in the past, the refugees' paperwork will be handled at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the same as other would-be emigrants. Many of the arriving refugees Thursday had been among 14,000 Soviet Jews waiting in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for final processing. It was the largest number of Jewish immigrants to arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a single day since the end of World War II. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said he had given up hope of getting out of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> before the deadline after his first application to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was denied. `` I did n't even reapply, but they said I could go.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they will continue to review the applications of Soviet refugees already waiting in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Since the early 1970s, both Jews and Christians who wanted to leave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> applied for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> visas at the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which performed consular functions for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They would then proceed to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where as many as 90 percent of the Soviet Jews expressed a desire to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Their applications almost automatically were approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials. The Israeli government has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to change the policy in the hope of attracting more Soviet Jews to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials deny the policy change was at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s behest.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two-thirds of Americans say in a new poll it is likely that abortions in their states will be further restricted in the next year, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> Poll found that 43 percent of respondents said abortion should be legal as it is now while 13 percent said it should not be allowed at all. Forty percent said abortion should be legal only in cases such as rape, incest or to save the mother's life. The national telephone poll of 1,347 adults, taken from Sept. 17-20, found 65 percent said they expected more state limits on abortion following the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision this summer upholding a restrictive <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law. The poll's findings have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, the Times said. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed said they were very or somewhat concerned that women may lose the right to have an abortion; 31 percent said they were not very concerned or not concerned at all. Concerning possible restrictions, 70 percent of respondents favored requiring the consent of the parents before a girl under 18 could have an abortion. Sixty-five percent favored requiring a test in a pregnancy of 20 weeks or more to make sure the fetus has not developed enough to live outside the womb. Thirty-five percent of respondents favored prohibiting public employees or public hospitals from performing abortions. The poll also found that 69 percent of respondents agreed with the following statement: `` Even in cases where you might think abortion is the wrong thing to do, the Government has no business preventing a woman from having an abortion.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules, Former Inmates React in ``Titicut Follies'' Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BOSTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A judge lifted a 22-year-old ban of a film depicting atrocities at a state mental asylum, with the condition that the filmmaker blur the faces of inmates who prefer their grim treatment remain a secret. Judge <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s ruling Thursday released the 1967 documentary `` Titicut Follies,'' by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, an award-winning director known for his stark potrayal of subjects like hospitals, racetracks and the men whose fingers are on the buttons that fire nuclear missiles. The 85-minute, black and white film depicts the moldering, often cruel, conditions at <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for the criminally insane, built in 1852 and replaced with new buildings since the film's production. Many scenes depict nude men in bare cells being baited by sadistic guards. One man is shown being force fed as he lies on a table and a liquid is poured down a rubber hose shoved into his nose. The film has no narrator. It was ordered withheld from the public six weeks after its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut on grounds it violated the privacy of the 62 featured inmates. In his ruling, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said that inmates who still wish to remain anonymous, or those who are incompetent to judge, must appear with their faces blurred. In reconsidering the ban, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> solicited comments from the inmates portrayed in the film, many of whom have died or could not be located. The judge said seven of 20 inmates located were competent to decide whether they wanted their identities masked. Some of those who appear in the film do n't want to revisit the dehumanization they endured, but others say the abuse they suffered must be exposed. `` To me, it was like a concentration camp,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, 51, who spent eight years at <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION> and now bags groceries and lives in <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION>, 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad they're showing the film _ I want to expose the state,'' said <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>. He said the film may `` make the public take some interest in conditions at state hospitals.'' Imposing the ban two decades ago, Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalus </PERSON> labeled the film a `` nightmare of ghoulish obscenities.'' His ban, against which <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> began fighting two years ago, was n't total. <PERSON> Kalus </PERSON> allowed the film to be shown to members of interested professions and the film has been shown regularly to psychology students, lawyers, social workers and journalists. In his ruling, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> tried to resolve the conflict between the film's potential to embarrass its subjects and the filmmaker's right for his work to be shown `` I have viewed the film and agree that it is a substantial and significant intrusion into the privacy of the inmates shown in the film,'' the judge wrote. `` However, I also regarded ` Titicut Follies,' as an outstanding film, artistically and thoughtfully edited with great social and historical value. ... Another observation about the film: it is true.'' State officials have said that since the film was made, conditions at <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION> have been improved, with a better trained staff and a smaller population. The film has been credited by some with forcing improvements at asylyms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikora </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney who was appointed by the court to interview 17 of the 20 located inmates shown in the documentary, said Thursday he would need more time to assess the effect of the ruling. Neither <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, a Cambridge-based filmmaker, nor his attorney returned telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Israelis Celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jews throughout <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today began their celebration of <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the Jewish new year, with prayers, picnics and tight security. The beginning of the Hebrew year will not be marked by blowing the traditional ram's horn, or shofar, in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 8,000 synagogues because the holiday falls on the <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>, when it is forbidden to sound the horn. Instead, the shofar will be blown on the second day of the new year festival Sunday. The new year 5750 was interpreted by some religious scholars as the `` year of miracles'' because 50 stands for the letter `` n'' in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>. The scholars linked the `` n'' to the word `` nisim,'' or miracle. But some newspapers interpreted the new year as the root to the word `` tashan,'' or sleep, suggesting weariness over the 21-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories. At least 575 Arabs have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and civilians during the revolt. Forty Israelis also have been slain in the violence. To prevent the uprising from interfering in the holiday, the army blocked travel into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by residents of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> until Monday morning and increased searches of Palestinians entering from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Overnight, police in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> rounded up 105 Palestinians who broke the law prohibiting residents of the territories from spending the night in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army also increased patrols along the Lebanese and Jordanian borders and police were reinforced throughout the country to head off possible guerrilla attacks. `` We want not only to ensure a feeling of safety but to let the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> celebrate as they choose,'' Police commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON> is celebrated on the first and second day of the Jewish month of <LOCATION> Tishrei </LOCATION>. It marks the beginning of the `` 10 days of awe,'' when Jews reflect on their deeds of the past year and repent for their sins. The period culminates in the fast of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which comes on Oct. 9. Tonight, the start of the holiday, Jewish families gather for traditional dinners, eating apples dipped in honey to signify a `` sweet new year.'' Ashkenazim, or Jews of European origin, eat a festive meal that traditionally includes chopped liver and gefilte fish, while Sephardim, Jews from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, eat couscous and fish heads. Vacationers, enjoying a long weekend, flocked to beaches in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and other coastal cities, taking advantage of sunny skies and 80-degree weather.

 A young mother accused of swapping her 3-month-old boy for $ 20 worth of crack cocaine was arrested after the father saw his son on the television news. The father said Thursday he will fight for custody of the child, who had been retrieved by a customer in the bar where the alleged trade took place. The baby, apparently unharmed, was turned over to state family services officials. `` This is one more example of how pathetic drug addiction can be,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a police spokesman. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 23, was charged Thursday with one count each of child endangerment and abandonment, police said. The 23-year-old father, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Saffold </PERSON>, turned on the TV news Wednesday night and saw his son, <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON>, in a policeman's arms. <PERSON> Saffold </PERSON> called 911 and by early evening police were able to identify the boy and mother. <PERSON> Saffold </PERSON> said he and Ms. <PERSON> Price </PERSON> had another child, a 1-year-old daughter, but she was taken by the state six months ago. <PERSON> Saffold </PERSON> said that Ms. Price had been smoking crack for about a year. He also said his son seemed well when he saw him Wednesday night at police headquarters. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said Ms. Price went into a bar Tuesday night and contacted an alleged dealer there known as `` the Crack Lady.'' The young woman said she wanted a $ 20 rock of cocaine but had no money. Another customer in the bar said the dealer responded, `` I sure would like to have a baby boy.'' The pair walked outside to complete the deal, investigators said, and the alleged dealer returned to the bar with the baby. Another woman in the bar asked the dealer if she could hold the baby and then took it home and called police in the morning, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. Police said it appeared to mark the first report of a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> baby being traded for drugs although similar deals have been reported elsewhere. `` I think it's a horrendous example of the vulnerability of people who are addicted to crack and the extent to which they will go,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Death Rate Highest in Southeast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The death rate from cervical cancer, which kills 4,500 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women a year, is higher in the Southeast than in other parts of the country, federal health officials say. The disease, the risk of which increases with the number of sexual partners, killed an average of 4,543 women each year in the period 1984-86, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Average mortality rates were highest in the Southeast, from the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Nine Southeastern states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were among 13 with annual cervical cancer death rates of more than 45 deaths per million women. The nine states were <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Others were <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The lowest rates were in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, with less than 20 deaths per year per million women. Compared with other types of cancer, `` the number of cases per year is small,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Cervical cancer accounts for less than 3 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cancer deaths among women; lung cancer and breast cancer are the chief causes. Nationwide, the mortality rate was 37 per million. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this year that rate was down 18 percent since 1979. Most women with cervical cancer survive. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reports that from 1974-85, 67 percent of women with cervical cancer were still alive five years after diagnosis. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said certain types of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus act as infectious agents, possibly increasing the risk of cervical cancer. Another risk factor, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, is smoking; 29 percent of all cervical cancer death is attributable to cigarette smoking. Pap tests, recommended annually by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, aid in early detection and treatment of cervical cancer, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. A study of cervical cancer cases in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in 1987 found five factors contributing to invasive, or more serious, cervical cancer: lack of Pap tests, too long a period between tests, rapid development of the disease between tests, a falsely negative test result, or lack of treatment following a positive test. In patients under 40, most patients either experienced rapid growth of the disease after a negative test, or had a falsely negative test result, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Among women aged 40-69, most had waited too long between screenings.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called for talks among political and social leaders of the two Koreas on national unification, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today rejected the offer as `` obsolete and nothing new.'' <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Byong-bo </PERSON>, spokesman for the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal is the same one made by the north's leader, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, in his New Year messsage. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> also turned down the earlier proposal. The latest North Korean overture, broadcast by <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday, calls for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> to hold a joint meeting of 60 political and social leaders, equally divided between them, on Feb. 20 next year to work out a new unification formula. `` The proposal is obsolete and has nothing new in it,'' <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, in what appeared to be a slight policy change, said that although it considered its unification formula the most effective, it also was willing to discuss other measures. Some experts in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> speculated that <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> may be willing to modify its longstanding unification formula calling for the two Koreas to operate as separate states under a confederation. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has rejected this idea. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> said the north's proposal, made by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-nam </PERSON>, that country's foreign minister, is basically the same. He said the latest <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> proposal is aimed at formenting dissident movements in the south. In the past, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded the convocation of a joint meeting of 600 political and social leaders from each side to discuss unification but this time it cut the number of delegates, the spokesman said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> did not specify the qualifications of delegates but in the past has said that they should include dissident leaders. South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo on Sept. 11 proposed that <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> form a `` Korean commonwealth'' before unification and build up mutual trust. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> immediately turned down <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s idea. Also today, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government approved a plan by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> organization to invite 30 North Korean monks and laymen to a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> lantern festival in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> next month. The approval cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a federation of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> orders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, to invite North Korean Buddhists to the Oct. 14 festival in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. It is unclear whether <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would accept the invitations. If <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accepts, it would mark the first religious exchange between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION>. North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the 1950-53 Korean War.

There were no promissory notes signed, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did commit himself to the principle of targeting any future funding increases toward needy preschoolers, for both Head Start, health and nutrition programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing in the sunshine on the lawn outside the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson-designed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotunda </PERSON>, pledged his `` determination to follow up in every way possible. We just can not let it sit here and end here, and I promise you that I wo n't.'' Earlier, in a keynote address, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` A social compact begins today in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a compact between parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, state legislators, governors and the administration.'' `` Educational reform is an urgent responsibility for every parent, every student, every community. And those who do not advance the cause of education, hinder it,'' he cautioned. Former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was rebuked by White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> for his comment that the governors' summit debates were full of `` pap and ... stuff that rhymes with pap,'' displaying `` a total absence of any knowledge'' about the schools. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> spoke for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, now the federal drug policy chief, `` Thanks for your comments, they were n't helpful.'' Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, Republican chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the consensus among the governors and administration officials was that `` Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> went overboard'' and `` was somewhat flip in his remarks.'' For the governors, some of whom have spent much of the 1980s battling to improve their schools, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message was music to the ears. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> lamented that now, `` you do n't find many parents who even go to open house in the school their children are attending It's a call to them ... to get involved.'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a Republican, predicted it will take a decade to reach the point where <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students are getting `` an education that's just as good as students are receiving in countries like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> struck one of the few discordant notes, suggesting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should scrap three $ 500 million stealth bombers and spend the money on school reforms instead. But even <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, a Democrat, acknowledged that stamping `` the White House ` Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' on the reform agenda is a plus. ... That's very valuable.'' In seeking school restructuring, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the governors endorsed stricter accountability focusing on `` results rather than on compliance with rules and regulations''; decentralization of school authority and decision-making; and `` real rewards'' for teachers who succeed with students and `` real consequences for failure.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said the accord on national goals is `` potentially a major turning point for education in this country.'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has embraced `` a kind of experimentation and child-oriented approach rather than the rigid conservative approach, which is to go back to the old system and put the screws on.'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There are no broad goals that we ca n't work with.'' But he predicted it will take some `` tough discussions'' to define the broad goals outlined at the summit. A governors' task force and administration officials will seek to define those goals by the governors' regular winter meeting in February. The accord also commits <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the governors to seek `` greater flexibility and enhanced accountability'' in federal school aid, to push state efforts to restructure schools and to report annually `` on progress in achieving our goals.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said, `` We will have a report card'' evaluating not only the schools, but how the states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fulfill their roles. A happy but weary <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said, `` Not only are we going to set national performance goals ... but we stand here before you and tell you we expect to be held personally accountable.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today it will disband the <ORGANIZATION> ZOMO </ORGANIZATION> riot police, the widely scorned paramilitary units long associated with the Communist government's repression of opposition activists. The helmeted police, with shields and batons, were especially active following the imposition of martial law in December 1981. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the police, is still run by the Communists, one of four cabinet posts retained by the party after the formation this month of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist-led government under Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The decision to disband the <ORGANIZATION> ZOMO </ORGANIZATION> was made to save money and remove an `` irritation'' for society, said <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON>, a ministry spokesman. The ZOMO squads will be replaced by special `` preventive patrol units'' of the civic militia, as the police force is called, to be established in 22 of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 49 provinces, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. In addition, the power to deploy the forces will be removed from provincial police chiefs and reserved for the office of the prime minister, a government presidium or the Interior Minister at their instruction, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. `` This is one of the most important changes because those troops were not bad by themselves but the formula for using them was wrong sometimes, and this formula is changing,'' the spokesman said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> had said this month in parliamentary hearings that he saw a need for some force trained to maintain public order. `` We assume at the same time these are indispensible troops because some danger for social peace and order will remain at a large scale that will have to be approached with mobilized troops,'' <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. `` I am talking ... about various big events, first of all sports events.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> budget published in early September by the liberal Communist weekly Polityka, there were 12,819 positions in the <ORGANIZATION> ZOMO </ORGANIZATION> department, not counting part-time employees and others assigned temporarily, including those doing mandatory military service. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> put the number of ZOMO at 28,000. The ZOMO, which stands in Polish for Motorized Units of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, had been used most to disband anti-Communist demonstrations during the years the government tried to suppress Solidarity and other opposition groups following martial law on Dec. 13, 1981. The squads would spill out of armored trucks and double-step in ranks, the officers hidden behind helmets with face guards and large shields. Alerts of `` ZOMO ZOMO'' would turn heads of protesters and onlookers, and send tension through a crowd as the troops moved forward to force marchers into retreat. The ZOMO have been controlled by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> during his eight years as interior minister, a post he retained in the new government after stepping down as prime minister in August following a futile three-week effort to form a Communist-led government. He was the chief negotiater for the Communist authorities during spring `` round-table'' talks on political and economic reform that led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status April 17, largely democratic elections in June and eventually the creation of a Solidarity-led government.

 Some men are reluctant to admit they read books by women writers and criticize their work as being less universal than men's, authors told the PEN international writers association. `` Writing by men is supposed to be more accessible to the human race,'' novelist <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said about what she sees as the prevailing belief. `` You do n't stop being defensive until you stop being attacked,'' she said during a panel discussion Thursday. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, perhaps <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s best known writer for such best-sellers as `` The Handmaid's Tale'' and `` Cat's Eye,'' was one of the most prominent critics of the association's 1986 congress in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for not including enough women. The Canadian meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, and earlier in the week in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, is the first in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since 1986. Organizers made an effort to include more women, ethnic and minority writers in its discussions. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> suggested the question might better be examined from the other angle. `` Why do n't I like <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerns </PERSON>?'' she asked. In one of the livelier sessions, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> joked that men at book signings often have told her how much their wives like her work. `` What is it that this phrase conceals?'' she said. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said either the men are n't reading her books or they do n't want to admit it, possibly for fear of being considered wimps. `` Although I can report from book signings that more and more men are saying, ` This book is for me,''' she said. <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> has some 11,000 members in more than 90 chapters worldwide organized along language lines. It pays special attention to freeing writers from prison, and to censorship and other threats to freedom of expression. The congress is being held in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for the first time since <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION>'s founding in 1921. The English-speaking Canadian chapter hosted the first portion in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and the French-speaking chapter is hosting the last days in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON>, the American author and feminist, suggested at the panel on feminine literature that women must stop being so defensive about the female experience. `` Is war more universal than childbirth?'' she asked. `` Maybe it is as universal.'' At an earlier panel on the writer and the exercise of freedom, <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> said threats to freedom of expression exist in democracies even if they may be more subtle than in authoritarian nations. `` I can tell you this from my personal experience as a writer and a woman of the last 25 years,'' she said. <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> noted the difficulties of getting ideas other than the prevailing view published or being exposed in the mass media subject to marketplace pressures. `` There are ways that our freedom is being continuously coopted,'' she said. `` And we collude in this.'' She said the idea of the `` new traditionalism'' that women want just their husband, children and home seems to be appearing more frequently in the mass media. `` It's something to watch,'' <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> today for four days of talks with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on uniting the Anglican and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches, divided since the 16th century Reformation. Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> was greeted on arrival at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci airport by top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, including Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promoting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>. In a brief statement, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said his talks likely would be `` frank'' but he was confident they would lead to increased understanding. Earlier, about 20 protesters at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport carried signs such as `` <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> resign'' and `` no to papal talks'' as the archbishop departed. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> refused to speak to the group. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s secretary for ecumenical affairs, <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said earlier he did not expect immediate union of the churches because, `` talks about closer relations have been going steadily on for 30 years.'' `` I am sure it will happen eventually because the founder of Christianity wanted one church,'' he said. Anglican leaders said they thought unity between Anglicans and Catholics would not come until the 21st century. `` It will happen, eventually,'' <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, Archbishop of Westminster and leader of Catholics in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, said in an interview with Channel 4 television late Thursday. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> have met four times, but this is <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s first official visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> as spiritual head of the state Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> He is also the leader of 70 million Anglicans worldwide, including 2.5 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians. The pope leads 850 million Roman Catholics. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is expected to discuss the nature of the Anglican Communion and explain how its system of dispersed authority gives a measure of equality among church leaders. The Anglican church does not have the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s central directing authority, although its priests look to <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> for guidance. The Anglican freedom allows members such as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians to ordain woman priests and, this year in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> diocese, the first Anglican woman bishop. `` There's no doubt about it, and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> himself has said so, that the ordination of women and especially the consecration of a woman as bishop, constitute very considerable difficulties for us and also the Orthodox church,'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said. Anglicans and Catholics have discussed for many years how their churches might draw closer together. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> caused a stir last week by telling an Italian journalist that the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> might recognize papal authority in a <ORGANIZATION> united </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION>, a view that had already been stated by the commission. Evangelicals in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who base their teaching strictly on the Bible and oppose unity with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, reacted indignantly. Their chief spokesman, the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, said, `` Many people in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> do n't want closer ties with the Church of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Already, people are leaving the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> because of the Catholicizing tendencies.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television Thursday he was looking forward to the visit. `` One thing which is at the center of my thoughts and I believe at the center of his -LRB- the pope's -RRB-, is that we do have a unity already,'' he said. `` We do n't have perfect unity, but there is something we have and sometimes people forget that.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is returning the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s 1982 visit to <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, the Anglican mother church and the seat of the first archbishop, <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 597. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> and the pope also met in <LOCATION> Accra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, in 1980 and in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in 1986. They met again later in that year in <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> invited leaders of world religions to pray for peace in the city, which is the birthplace of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. The first visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by an archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> since the Reformation was paid by the late <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who met Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> XXIII </PERSON> on Dec. 2, 1960. The Vatican regarded the meeting as so sensitive that it barred photographers. Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> in 1966 and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggan </PERSON> in 1977. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> separated the English from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> when the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> refused to annul his marriage with <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON>. The 1534 Act of Supremacy acknowledged the king as `` the only supreme head on Earth of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.''

 Soldiers and police were on alert today and panic-selling hit the country's stock exchanges after President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> banned the burial of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. There was little sign of tension, however. About 300 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters staged a vigil in front of the armed forces headquarters at suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the only rally reported today. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flags flown at half-staff until Sunday on government buildings in respect for the 72-year-old former president, who died Thursday in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ruled out allowing either <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' remains or members of his immediate family to return now because it `` could lead to some destabilization activities.'' A senior official had suggested the government might allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ashes to be flown to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said later that was not under consideration. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, called Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision `` so cruel, so inhuman and so immoral.'' Also today, a senior official said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death may encourage former associates to help efforts to recover the fortune allegedly stolen from the government during the late president's rule. Security was reinforced today at all radio and television stations, electric power plants, telephone exchanges and other essential installations in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters planned rallies and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masses </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and other cities. But military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the situation was calm nationwide and, `` We have not seen anything that is abnormal in the country.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters, including former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, met to plan strategy but did not comment later. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she took power on Feb. 25, 1986, after a civilian-military uprising ended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule. But rallies by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> followers have dwindled steadily over the past three years. Most of the recent crowds have numbered only a few hundred. At a news conference today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the return of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' remains might trigger clashes between pro-and-anti-Marcos groups. She said officials could lift the ban if conditions in the nation improve but gave no timetable. `` We believe that allowing the remains of the late president to be brought back here would cause some instability and would discourage very much investors and tourists from coming here, plus also dividing the people,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said recent opinion polls by the government showed public almost equally divided on the issue of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' burial. `` For my part, I have forgiven Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' she said. `` But it is not just a question of forgiving. As president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, it is my duty to see to it that the security and welfare of the Filipino people is assured.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would seek to prevent any flight from carrying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Following a meeting today of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ileto </PERSON> said the government may send a representative to the funeral if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is buried in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Asked if the government was offering the return of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ashes as one official had indicated, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said, `` No, there is absolutely no truth to that. I did not even discuss the matter of his cremation.'' Share prices fell today in early trading on the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> stock exchanges as retail investors feared <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death would enrage his followers and stir up trouble for the government. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Composite Stock Index of 25 selected issues dropped 16.27 points to 1,131.67, down 1.4 percent from Thursday's close. But prices began recovering in later trading, brokers said. The Philippine government says <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates embezzled up to $ 10 billion before he was ousted. But efforts to recover any money have been delayed by legal problems, both here and in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where the bulk is believed stashed. `` We believe that there are cronies who were prevented from cooperating with us because of ... fear of the president to whom they owe so much,'' said <PERSON> Mateo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government. `` But now, for the sake of the nation ... I believe they would voluntarily come to us and tell us the truth,'' he said.

 A man convicted in the grisly killing of a schoolteacher was executed today despite last minute appeals by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and human rights lawyers in this country. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a prosecutor said two white police riot squad members will be charged with assaulting anti-apartheid protesters as a result of allegations of brutality made by a dissident mixed-race officer. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mangena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON>, 36, was hanged along with a mixed-race man sentenced in a separate killing. <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON>, a black member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, was convicted of the 1985 killing of <PERSON> Mellina </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, a black teacher who apparently defied a school boycott called by anti-apartheid activists. Mrs. <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, who was in her 50s, had a gasoline-soaked tire placed around her neck and set alight. In nationwide unrest from 1984 to 1986, militant anti-apartheid activists used the `` necklace'' to kill dozens of people they considered collaborators with the white government. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, called on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to commute the death sentence of <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON> and all other `` political prisoners.''

Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not consider <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON> a political prisoner. `` There can be no circumstances in which a violent murder such as the one in this case ... could be considered a rightful political act,'' said <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. The South African Lawyers for Human Rights, who oppose the death penalty, said they made unsuccessful appeals to the government Thursday on behalf of <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON> and the man executed alongside him, <PERSON> Jacobus </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. Thirty-nine people have been executed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year, far fewer than in recent years when more than 100 people were hanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black men, remain on death row. About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this year and now are serving prison terms. In the police case, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossouw </PERSON>, attorney general for the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> region, said Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazelle </PERSON> and Lt. D.J. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> would appear in court Tuesday to plead to assault charges stemming from a Sept. 5 confrontation between police and activists in the mixed-race township of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain. <PERSON> Rossouw </PERSON> said Thursday he decided to prosecute after investigating complaints by Lt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>, who accused riot squad members of acting like `` wild dogs'' and beating and whipping protesters and bystanders. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> went public with his allegations Sept. 6, the day of segregated parliamentary elections that excluded the black majority. He has become a folk hero with many township youths, who sometimes chant his name at anti-government rallies. Activists say 23 people were killed in election day violence instigated by police in black and mixed-race townships outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Police initially denied responsibility for any deaths. However, they have opened an investigation and now say 19 people were killed, including 10 who died in black-on-black factional fighting and nine in incidents where police may have been involved. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said he welcomed the decision to prosecute but called for a broader investigation into alleged police brutality. He said the Sept. 5 violence was `` only one of the complaints that I've got. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Roussouw </PERSON> Thursday, has called for the resignation of Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and requested a meeting with President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Government Eases Stance On Multiracial Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government for the first time is willing to take responsibility for multiracial schools, either by running them directly or funding them, a senior official said today. Most public schools would remain segregated, but the new approach would benefit families in certain urban neighborhoods that are in the process of being declared multiracial. Most of these areas have been integrated for years despite laws mandating residential segregation. <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clase </PERSON>, minister of white education, announced the new policy after a meeting Thursday with a delegation of people trying to prevent the closure of <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Enrollment has declined sharply at the whites-only school, and a committee of parents, teachers and students has campaigned to save the facility by opening it to all races. <PERSON> Clase </PERSON> said today the government had a responsibility to provide education in so-called `` free settlement areas'' _ the official term for neighborhoods that will be designated multiracial. He said the committee seeking to save <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> had two options _ it could transform the school into a 100 percent state subsidized private school, or it could apply to have the school's neighborhood become a free settlement area. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, education spokesman for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Clase </PERSON>'s statement represented a `` dramatic shift in policy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-government newspaper, said in an editorial Thursday that it would make no sense to allow mixed residential areas unless the government allowed mixed public schools in those areas. At present, black, mixed-race and Indian children living in multiracial areas must either attend private schools or travel long distances to segregated public schools in outlying townships.

 A car packed with dynamite exploded in the basement garage of a downtown hotel, damaging or destroying 60 cars and wounding one person, police said. Three other bombs caused minor damage elsewhere. The car bomb exploded Thursday night on the first level of the garage of the <LOCATION> Tequendama </LOCATION> hotel, which is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s retired officers organization The hotel was not damaged, and no one was evacuated. The hotel is where many of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign television and radio reporters have been staying while in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to cover a 6-week-old war between the government security forces and drug traffickers. The garage runs under the hotel, a high-rise apartment building and a shopping complex. The compact car carried 70 pounds of dynamite, the national police said in an interview. One man was hurt slightly by flying glass. Another bomb exploded harmlessly Thursday night at a transformer substation of the government's electric company, the police said. The other two bombs exploding Thursday night were in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, a city of 1 million people in western <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. One bomb was at a bank, and the other at a warehouse owned by a bank, national police said. No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, among 118 in the past six weeks that have killed 10 people and wounded 143. Government security forces have blamed the bombings on drug traffickers, who declared war on the government as a result of the drug crackdown and the pledge to extradite traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug charges.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today toured areas of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> devastated by Hurricane Hugo, viewing scenes of flattened buildings and forests and signing a $ 1.1 billion relief package for its victims. `` I'm here trying to mobilize the resources of the federal government,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, standing in front of a school bus demolished by a fallen tree in nearby <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shown around the grounds of the <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> _ littered with fallen trees, smashed vehicles and twisted metal _ by <PERSON> Summerville </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, who called the Sept. 21 storm `` the worst storm that ever happened to our state.'' The president, patting the mayor on the shoulder, said, `` Why am I here? I'm here to give a little encouragement to a courageous man.'' The overcast skies cleared long enough for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take a 15-minute helicopter tour toward the coast, flying low over some of the hardest hit areas of downtown <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. At the end of his trip, the president told a small crowd at the air base, `` You could n't help be impressed to hear the people say, ` we're going to bounce back.''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had been criticized by some officials for not organizing aid faster, said he was satisfied the federal government was doing all that could be done. `` To the critics, I say, I understand ... we want to solve the problem,'' he said. In signing the relief bill aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One en route from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the assistance approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday was `` imperative to those who are suffering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Hugo.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 15-minute motorcade to the inland town of <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION> took him past pine forests filled with trees snapped in half, mangled road signs, decimated trailer parks and dozens of buildings with their roofs torn off. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> told the president `` most people did n't realize how broad this devastation was.'' He said `` untold millions of dollars in damage'' remained and that 550,000 people were displaced and that 270,000 were out of work. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the federal relief package `` will help the victims of Hurricane Hugo rebuild their homes, communities, businesses and lives.'' At the same time, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced a $ 1.1 million program from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help the stricken area beef up its police forces, including paying overtime and repairing damaged equipment. In addition, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made an emergency $ 5 million available to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help retrain displaced workers and for other programs. The emergency relief package provides money for storm-ravaged areas in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, in addition to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, who accompanied the president on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, told reporters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had given him a $ 1,000 personal check from himself and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, to help the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in the relief efforts. `` The money will start flowing,'' said <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>. Asked if it would be enough, he said, `` Ca n't tell. It's certainly a good start.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been criticized by some local officials and Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, for not responding faster to the emergency. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> was invited to make the trip with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today, but declined, the White House said. `` We need him to understand how deep the human suffering is in this,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` I want him to know that it's a long haul for us, and it's not a quick fix.'' The president spent just over two hours in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, squeezing in the visit before a previously scheduled late-morning event in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was participating in a retirement ceremony at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy for Admiral <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is stepping down as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1. The president apologized that his visit was so short. `` I commend the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, adding that he also was proud of the response of hurricane victims in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Again mentioning criticism of the pace of the federal response, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` When all the dust is settled and the debris removed, people are going to understand this was a team effort.'' `` It does bring out the very best in the men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the president said, adding, `` the spirit of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> comes through loud and clear.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> visit follows by one day a visit to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> by the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The 1988 Democratic presidential contender, visiting shelters housing those displaced by the storm, urged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` not just come and visit a house or two but to come with a plan and resources.'' A week after the storm slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s coastline with 135-mph winds, five <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> centers were jammed processing applications for emergency federal disaster relief. With the <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy under heavy criticism from local officials for moving too slowly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants to make sure <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is committing all of its resources effectively,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president was increasing from five to nine the number of <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to better handle the crush of applicants for disaster aid. The 200 people staffing <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> centers would be increased by `` as many as it takes,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> has been blamed for 29 deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 18 of them in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The storm also killed at least 33 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Some 200,000 utility customers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> remained without power Thursday, more than half in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area. About 50,000 Charleston-area residents were displaced by the storm, officials said. The $ 1.1 billion relief package swept through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday with near-hurricane speed of its own. `` There never was this much money,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` But this also may well be the most damaging one -LRB- hurricane -RRB- in history.'' <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said the legislation would help provide low-cost loans of up to $ 10,000 for storm victims who can not qualify for private loans. During debate on the emergency package, <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> told colleagues: `` I have never seen so much damage in my life. It looked like there had been a war there.''

 Evolution theory would be emphasized more than ever in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> science classes under a new state guideline approved by a blue ribbon panel of educators. Thursday's 6-0 vote of the science subcommitteeof the state <ORGANIZATION> Curriculum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> sent the new teaching guidelines to the full commission. If the commission approves the guidelines today as expected, they will go to the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> for a public hearing in October and a final vote in November. Science teachers and school administrators who attended the subcommittee hearing were unanimous in congratulating the panel for the increased emphasis on teaching evolution. Unlike past state hearings on evolution, which attracted standing-room-only crowds of Christian fundamentalists opposed to the exclusion of creation theory, only one person spoke against the proposed new science guidelines. `` I am a creationist, and I hope creation theory is included,'' said <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ripon </LOCATION>. The new guidelines for science teachers and local school administrators, formally known as the state science curriculum framework, is a detailed policy statement of what should be taught in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schools and how it should be taught. The frameworks do n't mandate course content, which is determined by the state's 1,030 elected local school boards, but they set standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective as mandates. Only four pages of the 187-page framework refer to what subcommittee chairwoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stage </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> calls `` the controversial topic of evolution, which is not controversial in the scientific world.'' The key provision in the science framework is brief, but makes a pro-evolution statement more strongly than any previous <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> education policy guideline has been made: `` Evolution is the central organizing theory of biology, and has fundamental importance in other sciences as well. It is no more controversial in scientific circles than gravity or electricity. `` While recognizing the right of individuals to hold and practice their own beliefs, teachers must not be pressured by anyone to distort or suppress science,'' the framework continues, adding that teachers should feel free to respond, `` Sorry, but that's not a question for science,'' when students raise the creation theory. `` Such questions should be treated with respect and referred to family or clergy for further discussion,'' it declares. <ORGANIZATION> Curriculum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> predicted unanimous commission approval.

 Episcopal bishops say they are ready to work together to preserve church unity by accommodating sharp differences over the ordination of women. In a statement Thursday, 182 members of the House of Bishops affirmed the ministry of women while calling for pastoral sensitivity toward those who believe women should not be ordained. `` I think there was a real expression in this house for ` Let's move on,''' Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said `` I do n't think there was any question about that I think we are ready to get on with the mission.'' The statement welcomed Suffragan Bishop <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the first female bishop in the worldwide Anglican Communion, but said those within Anglicanism who oppose the ordination of women `` hold a recognized theological position.'' It also called for following the guidelines of an international church commission that this year urged Anglicans to `` live together'' despite differences on matters of faith. The bishops' statement was sent to Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A.K </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> today for a four-day official visit with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The meeting is aimed at resolving obstacles to unity between the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Anglican churches. The statement also will be sent to the primates of the other 26 provinces in the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. Traditionalist bishops who met in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in June to form a `` church within the church'' said they were pleased with the statement, which came at the end of a six-day meeting. `` God's hand is in this,'' said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>. `` What we have done is simply to remove the siege mentality. Our convictions remain the same, but we've got an atmosphere now in which I think we can actually go forward together without compromising our beliefs.'' The statement expresses the collective belief of the house but holds no canonical authority. It was shaped in closed sessions in the city where the denomination was organized in 1789 as the first free and independent Anglican church outside the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>. The bishops opted not to issue a pastoral letter, which would have been required reading in every parish serving the church's 2.5 million members. Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said her reception at the meeting had been `` overwhelmingly affirmative, even on the part of some who disagree on the ordination of women.'' She expressed hope that this would be `` the last time the house will have to deal with this as a public statement.''

 An Afghan air force pilot landed his Soviet-made fighter jet at <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s border city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> today and joined anti-Communist rebels, the guerrillas said. A release issued by the U.S.-backed rebel government-in-exile said the pilot, <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalaluddin </PERSON>, was assigned to bomb the strategic <LOCATION> Kabul-to-Jalalabad </LOCATION> highway in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when he diverted to <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jalaluddin </PERSON>, who uses only one name, was stationed at the Communist government's largest air force base at <LOCATION> Bagram </LOCATION>, 145 miles east of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. A rebel commander, <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, said the defection was pre-arranged, although he refused to give details. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> is a commander with the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> rebel group. The <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> government has custody of the pilot and the aircraft, said <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will keep the bomber `` until we can claim it for our own, now that there is a hope that we will have an air force some day,'' <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> said, referring to the rebels' goal of overthrowing the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Anti-Communist fighters, headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have been battling for more than a decade to topple the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the major backer of the guerrilla fighters, while <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> outfits its allies in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. After nine years of military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> withdrew the last of its 103,000 soldiers in February but promised to continue arming the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government as long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplied the rebels. About two months ago another Afghan government pilot flew his SU-22 ground-attack fighter to <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> and defected to the rebels. The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen, meaning Islamic holy warriors, also reported the death of a senior Communist army officer during fighting outside the key city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 45 miles east of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official radio confirmed the officer's death. Rebels claimed the death occurred last week, but Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> gave no date.

<TEXT>
 Indian peacekeeping forces battled Tamil guerrillas in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, killing five militants and shattering a 10-day-old cease-fire, military officials said today. Elsewhere, at least 14 people died in ethnic violence this week, despite a truce the army called in its fight against anti-government Sinhalese radicals. Military officials who requested anonymity said the Indian soldiers clashed with Tamil guerrillas in the northeastern town of <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> on Thursday. Five rebels were killed and five wounded, they said. Two Indian soldiers also were hurt in the first major attack since the peacekeeping forces called an indefinite cease-fire Sept. 20. Tamil guerrillas agreed to honor the truce. Military officials accused the largest and most militant group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, of provoking the clash. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent 47,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in July 1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil rebellion. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> government has said the remaining 42,000 troops will be gone by Dec. 31. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, contend they are denied jobs and education by the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which mediated the peace accord, became involved in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic problems because 60 million Tamils living in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sympathize with the rebel cause. The accord offered the Tamils limited autonomy if they abandon their demand for an independent homeland in the northeast and surrender their weapons. The Tamil <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> rejected the accord and turned their guns on Indian soldiers. The presence of Indian troops also triggered a 2-year-old violent campaign by Sinhalese radicals, who accused the government of offering too many concessions to the minority Tamils and compromising the country's sovereignty by inviting foreign troops to Sri Lankan soil.

<HEAD>Methodist College President to Allow Exhibit of Painting Mayor Banned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a Methodist college invited an artist to exhibit a painting that the mayor had called unfit for children when he banned it from a museum. `` I will encourage -LRB- the artist -RRB- to find a place and time on campus to show this painting in relation to all of his paintings,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Huntingdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. The artist, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, is director of the college's art department. Mayor <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> had the painting, called `` Television Envangelism,'' removed Monday from the city's Armory Learning Arts Center gallery after three people complained that it was `` vulgar and offensive,'' according to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON>, an assistant to the mayor. The painting, part of an exhibit by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, depicts a clothed woman bathed in light similar to that cast by a television screen.

A police spokesman said the seven policemen were only slightly injured and that four protesters were arrested.

The demonstrators chanted `` We wo n't forget the massacre!'' and `` Oppose the National Day!'' They also sang patriotic Chinese songs.

 The Communist Party leader urged <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> to defend socialism and ruled out a multiparty system in a nationally broadcast speech today marking 40 years of Communist rule. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>'s speech in the Great Hall of the People opened a weekend of festivities marking revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s Oct. 1, 1949 proclamation of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after decades of civil war `` Only socialism can save <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> declared in a speech thick with traditional socialist rhetoric and praise for the party's crushing of massive, student-led, pro-democracy protests in June. Since then, supporters of liberal change have been purged, including then-party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, and hard-line attacks on capitalism and pluralism, such as <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s speech, have become the norm. The capital remains under martial law imposed during the protests, and public warnings have been issued against any attempt by disgruntled participants in the spring movement to sabotage the celebrations. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> today, 100 students protesting the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement clashed with police outside an official reception for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s National Day. Seven policemen were injured and four protesters were arrested, police said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Many of the territory's 5.7 million people took to the streets during the pro-democracy movement to voice their support. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said today that `` history has proven the socialist system has great vigor and vitality. The replacement of capitalism with socialism is the great historical trend.'' Calls for a multiparty system, he said, are `` extremely destructive to our cause and -LRB- are -RRB- liable to be exploited by a small handful of reactionaries.'' One can not oppose socialism and be patriotic, he said. `` People of all nationalities and all party members, especially leaders, must maintain a high degree of vigilance,'' he said, referring not to any military threat but to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> liberal ideas that might undermine the party's power. He reiterated the party's accusation since June that Western nations seek to stimulate a `` peaceful evolution'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> away from socialism A return to capitalism, he said, would `` give rise to a capitalist class by fattening it with the sweat and toil of the laboring people'' and reduce most Chinese to `` extreme poverty.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> stood with his arms firmly planted on each side of the podium and his head down as he plowed through the 80-minute midafternoon speech. The speech, televised live and immediately reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, was before an invited audience of more than 10,000 made up of top party and government leaders, model workers and soldiers. They applauded briefly 14 times, cued each time when <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> raised his voice in a flourish and then paused. Foreign reporters were not allowed to attend. <PERSON> Xinhua </PERSON> later praised <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> for his `` penetrating analysis'' of issues facing the party. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> praised as the mainstay of the party, did not attend the speech, in keeping with his habit of skipping most public government and party functions. But the 85-year-old leader has made several public appearances in the past month despite reported ill health. Most recently, he was shown on television Thursday meeting briefly with more than 2,000 party-selected `` model workers.'' At that gathering, he walked side-by-side with <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, apparently underscoring his desire to promote <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> as the new party center. Small parties and receptions celebrating the 40th anniversary of Communist rule have been going on all week. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s speech began a weekend of activities at the Great Hall and adjoining <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. In past years, thousands of ordinary citizens flocked to the square in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on National Day to admire special displays of flowers and colored lights. This year, however, the square has been under military guard, open only to those with special permission, ever since the army recaptured it June 3-4 from the student protesters after a bloody march into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people. Elaborate flower arrangements in the shape of the national flag and other symbols have been erected in the vast square, and specially chosen groups will perform dances there over the weekend. Celebrations will climax with a fireworks display Sunday night. Also today, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> students went to a cotton mill to begin a 100-day `` social investigation'' campaign aimed at awakening pro-democracy students to the realities of Chinese life. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said students from more than 50 universities will send students to work along with and observe the common people. The campaign, organized by the city <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, will include a `` factory day,'' a `` country day'' and a `` military camp day.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is racing to get as much of its spending business finished as possible in time for the new fiscal year, but once again lawmakers will fall dramatically short of their goal. A handful of spending measures for various agencies advanced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. But with fiscal 1990 beginning Sunday and only one of 13 annual spending bills on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk, lawmakers sent him a stopgap bill to keep the government functioning through Oct. 25. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the emergency measure today en route to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where he examined destruction caused last week by Hurricane Hugo. The bill contained $ 1.1 billion for areas wrecked by the storm's winds and waves. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders had been saying _ until the last several days _ that they hoped to complete all 13 spending bills by Oct. 1. Lawmakers met that deadline last year, the first time they had done so since 1976. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early today adopted a $ 288 billion military spending measure for next year that would provide $ 4.3 billion for Star Wars programs. The overall bill was adopted 96-2. On the day's crucial tally, lawmakers voted 53-47 to restore $ 600 million to <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> they had cut earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provided just $ 3.1 billion for the missile defense system. That difference is one of many that <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will try thrashing out beginning next week. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, voted 274-137 to adopt a $ 1.9 billion compromise bill financing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' own operations next year that reduces mass mailings from six to three annually, but saves them from virtual elimination. Only Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 245-137 for a non-binding measure supporting an almost total end to the free mailings. The $ 45 million saved was to be spent for treatment and prevention programs for pregnant drug addicts. <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators also are continuing their search for a compromise to the amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> to ban federal aid for `` obscene or indecent'' materials, or for a work that `` denigrates'' a person's race, religion, ethnic origin, sex, age or handicap. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, lost a round early today when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 62-35 against a show of support for his amendment. The chamber had adopted the provision on a voice vote on July 26. Bargainers indicated Thursday they were considering requiring that a commission study how federal grants are dispersed to art projects. They were divided over whether a law was needed defining standards of decency a work should meet to qualify for government backing. One federally funded exhibits recently included photographs depicting homosexual acts and children in suggestive positions, while another showed a photograph of a crucifix in urine.

 The Soviet Union dropped an atomic bomb near <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units in 1954 to test the effects of the blast and soldiers' ability to fight on irradiated ground, a newspaper disclosed today `` After the atomic strike, there were not only no landmarks left on the terrain, but the area itself became unrecognizable,'' said the armed forces daily <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. `` However, the troops fulfilled their assigned tasks completely.'' The newspaper said the bomb was dropped from a plane in the south Urals. It did not report any casualties, or address the long-term health problems caused by radiation and how the soldiers may have been affected. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 100 nuclear tests were conducted above ground at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site near <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> prior to 1963, when President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> signed the treaty banning explosions in the atmosphere. In April 22, 1952, a bomb was dropped from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airplane and detonated in the air as news reporters sat on bleachers watching. The event was seen live on network television. Scores of soldiers who were assigned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test site during the above-ground explosions have sought compensation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for illnesses they trace to the testing. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said foxholes and fire trenches, many with overhead covers, and deep underground shelters with double doors were built for the soldiers, equipment and ammunition involved in the Soviet exercise. The newspaper said the bomb was exploded because of the Cold War and at a time when <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were expanding by bringing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into the defense alliance. `` It never occurred to us to question any measure meant to bolster the army's battleworthiness and the country's defense capability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper's expose was titled `` The Explosion We Can Now Talk About.'' Although testing of the atomic device was reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency three days after it took place, there was no mention then that troops were involved. At the time, the effects of radiation were the least understood aspect of atomic weapons, the report said. `` The bomb was exploded 500 meters -LRB- yards -RRB- above ground, leaving little radioactive contamination,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulganin </PERSON>, who was then Soviet defense minister, described the test as successful, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. Since 1963, all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests have been buried in holes drilled beneath the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert or in tunnels carved into hillsides.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> urged closer cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in battling drugs as he prepared for his first official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> `` will continue to fight it because it represents a threat to national sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said Thursday night. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who leaves Sunday for a weeklong visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said drug trafficking will be a top issue in his talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government provides equipment and materials to the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> attorney general's office, which coordinates the anti-drug campaign and maintains a large force of law enforcement agents, mainly to stop smuggling of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said Mexican agents have seized more than 24 tons of cocaine this year. He said that represents a significant portion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption. The president said the war on drugs would be more effective if there were more coordination and a greater exchange of information with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train was blowing its horn when it slammed into a fire truck at a rural crossing, killing two firefighters and injuring about 150 people aboard the train, authorities said today. Twelve of 16 cars and both locomotives of the Crescent derailed in the accident about 7:40 p.m. Thursday about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leatherwood </PERSON> said. The train was bound from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` The train was blowing its horn as it was supposed to,'' <PERSON> Leatherwood </PERSON> said. `` Some people try to beat the train and they always lose out. We're very saddened by that ... but people just do n't have the perception of the speed and think the train can come to a quick stop, and it ca n't, not with that tonnage behind the train.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who was at the scene today, said it was too early to say what happened. `` That's pure speculation on anyone's part to say what the driver thought or saw at the time ... it is possible he had sirens going,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. There were no warning lights or bars at the crossing, which is not uncommon since it was on private land, state police spokeswoman <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said. She said she did not know who owned the land. Work crews were clearing the wreckage this morning with a crane and other heavy equipment. The fire truck was shattered by the impact, and the biggest piece of the vehicle remained flattened across the front of the locomotive. It was so mangled that the only clue that it had been a fire truck was its red color. `` I felt us go across one track, and the next thing I know, I woke up and I was in the hospital,'' said <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, one of five firefighters aboard the truck. <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, who was treated at a hospital for minor injuries and released, said he did not see or hear the train. Ms. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> identified the dead firefighters as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, both of <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON>. Two other firefighters and seven train passengers were in serious but stable condition today, hospital officials said. Fauquier Sheriff's Deputy R.R. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said 150 or more people on the train were injured. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said the board sent an investigative team to the scene. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON> said the team spent the night gathering documents and information. `` We're talking to witnesses, to the crew to see why it happened.'' The train was carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. Rescue personnel formed a human chain to guide the passengers through brush away from the train. <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student from <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said help arrived within minutes and rescuers used ladders to help people climb down. `` We were really lucky,'' she said. An unidentifed resident told <ORGANIZATION> WQRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> his son saw the accident. He said it would have been difficult for the truck driver not to have seen the train because the train had its light on, visibility was good and the crossing is on a flat, straight stretch of track. Passenger <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who was sitting toward the front of the train, said he heard a `` big thump. ... Then, I could tell the train came off the tracks. I started bracing myself.'' `` Luckily the train was n't going very fast,'' said <PERSON> Roby </PERSON>, who was traveling with a group to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to see Sunday's professional football game between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the speed limit for the train was 79 mph at the crossing, but he did not know how fast the train was traveling. One woman sitting in the front row of <PERSON> Roby </PERSON>'s car was hurt when she flew out of her seat and hit the wall, and others were injured when their seats broke lose, <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> said. The last reported derailment of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train was April 6, when both engines and the first eight cars of an 18-car train jumped the tracks near <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, causing minor injuries to 34 passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s worst wreck occurred on Jan. 4, 1987, when three linked-Conrail locomotives slid through a stop sign and into the path of a 12-car <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train at <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, killing 16 and injuring 174. The <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer and brakeman were later found to have been using marijuana.

<HEAD>School Heads Say They Will Defy Cutback Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State college and university presidents say they will refuse to comply with a budget-crisis order by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration to cut 700 positions from the higher education system. `` This is not something that I will do in the middle of a year where we've already cut $ 8 million,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. `` There's no way we can do it and be a university when it's over,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> `` I wo n't do it.'' The mandate, issued Wednesday, orders <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> to cut an additional $ 8 million and about 200 positions, and <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> to lay off 56 in a $ 2.5 million reduction of its $ 52.6 million budget. <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON>, chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said he is scheduled to discuss the order Monday with the man who issued it, Administration and Finance Secretary <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON>. `` I've talked to 12 presidents today and they all say they simply ca n't do it,'' said UMass President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, who heads an association of state college presidents. `` There just is n't a lot of flexibility at this point.'' The administration of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ordered the elimination of 2,300 state jobs by Jan. 1 as part of a 5 percent across-the-board budget cut to offset an estimated $ 340 million budget shortfall. The education cutbacks are intended to reduce administrative positions, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a top administration and finance aide. `` Our preference would be that they minimize the impact on teaching faculty,'' he said. `` We'll just lock up their funds,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said of any college president who fails to comply. `` We ca n't have administrators dictating whether we're going to have a budget deficit.'' `` We're in the process of dismantling the -LRB- educational -RRB- system,'' countered <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON>, chairman of the regents. `` My question is whether this dismantling is with the consent of the state as a whole.'' <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 6,000 employees in the higher education system, said the response to the administration's order should be: `` Just say no.''

 Threatening weather delayed the launch of a private rocket to test Star Wars anti-missile sensors and a possible escape vehicle for space station astronauts. The 58-foot-tall <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> booster was scheduled for launch from this coastal military base Thursday at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> satellite woul be orbiting overhead in proper position for the Star Wars experiment. But the $ 2 million launch and 15-minute suborbital flight were postponed until Saturday because rain, clouds and fog created the possibility the 33,400-pound rocket could be hit by lightning, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittinghill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amroc </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing director. <ORGANIZATION> Amroc </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, billed the planned launch as the first in the nation using a rocket totally designed and built with private funds. There have been two other commercial launches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, but both used rockets built with government money. The Amroc booster is intended to release a cloud of inert gas for a test of missile-detecting sensors aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> satellite, which was launched from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in March. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> contains various sensors that some day may be used as part of a Strategic Defense Initiative system _ nicknamed <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> _ in which satellites would detect incoming enemy nuclear warheads so they could be destroyed, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said by phone from the Pentagon. The Amroc rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineering test model of an 8 -LCB- - foot-wide `` ParaShield. It is a combined heat shield and parachute that someday might be part of an escape system to allow space station astronauts to return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Akin </PERSON>, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Akin's design class built the 390-pound model, which includes a ParaShield and instruments to monitor its performance, after he assigned them to design a spacecraft that could be launched on any existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space boosters.

 Two women have been charged with lining up their six children in the home they shared and allowing men to take their pick for sex, police said. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, was charged last week with four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, was charged with one count of first-degree child abuse and four counts of criminal sexual conduct. They are not accused of sexually abusing the children themselves. Investigators say they believe at least seven men visited the women's house frequently in 1987 and 1988 to choose their victims from the line-up. They said the children were then sexually assaulted in their bedrooms. `` The kids would just look at each other as if to say ` Oh God, not again,''' Detective <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. The women have denied the allegations, police said. The women, who are not related, were living together in <LOCATION> Otsego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of Grand Rapids, and each had three children in the house. Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said today that the six children have a number of different last names, and authorities have been unable to determine who their biological fathers are. He said the women have been uncooperative in background checks on them or the children. The children, five girls and one boy, have been living in foster homes since May 1988, after one of the girls came to school with bruises and told school officials of the alleged abuse. Five of the children are 8 to 13 years old; the sixth is a developmentally disabled 18-year-old girl. After interviewing the girl at school, <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said he petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Allegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to have the children removed. Police did n't seek arrest warrants for the women until two weeks ago, when they believed the children were prepared to testify. `` We did n't feel a year ago they were prepared to testify or could testify,'' <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said. Police said the line-ups occurred at least once a week for at least a year. The women also allegedly beat the children and forced them to clean floors with toothbrushes and eat dog food, police said. Authorities were investigating motives for the alleged crimes. `` The assumption would be money or narcotics changed hands,'' <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said. There is medical evidence to substantiate the children's claims of sexual abuse, police said. Two of the girls were believed to have been spared, they added. One man, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION>, has been charged with second-degree criminal sexual conduct, and police are seeking others. `` They'd select their child and go into a room to have sex. The kids' stories are consistent and corroborate each other,'' <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said. The women were being held in the <LOCATION> Allegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION> on $ 10,000 bond and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> on $ 12,500 bond. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday in circuit court.

 In the year of the nation's largest oil spill, Alaskans will receive their second-fattest annual check from the state's oil wealth savings account. This year's `` dividend'' from the $ 10.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> will total $ 873.16, state officials announced Thursday. That's more than $ 46 over what was paid last year Checks will be mailed beginning Oct. 9, more than six months after the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> struck a reef in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil. A family of four will receive $ 3,492.64. Voters created the trust fund in 1976 to save a portion of the state's oil revenues. The idea was to ensure the state benefits from its oil wealth long after the oil is gone. Since 1982, a portion of the fund's earnings has been given each year to every <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> resident who meets the residency requirements, regardless of age or income. A person must live in the state from October of the previous year through March to qualify. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, with no state sales or income taxes, is the only state that pays its residents for being residents. The largest check _ $ 1,000 per person _ was given out the first year. The amount was a flat rate set by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> after the program was delayed several years by court battles. The amount being given out this year is the largest since then. `` For many families, the annual dividend distribution is anticipated as a welcome and necessary part of their annual income,'' state Revenue Commissioner <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said in announcing the 1989 dividend. The state estimated 517,693 eligible applicants this year. The fund's earnings in the year ended June 30 totaled $ 868 million, up from $ 789 million in the prior fiscal year. Of that, $ 452 million was made available for dividends. The fund's principal can not be spent. The portion of the earnings not used for dividends is used to inflation-proof the principal and boost the earnings reserve account.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today embraced a toned-down version of Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' attempt to ban federal aid for `` obscene'' art, 11 hours after it voted to reject more sweeping restrictions outright. On a 65-31 vote, senators approved a non-binding measure urging <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to adopt legislation ending government assistance for obscene depictions of some sexual and erotic subjects, but falling short of all the restrictions <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wanted. `` We do know in our hearts that there is such a thing as obscenity,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., who opposed parts of <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' proposal and helped shape the new provision The adopted language evolved when <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, offered to drop his insistence that federal aid should be forbidden for art that `` denigrates'' a religion, race, ethnic background, sex or handicap. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, despite <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' opposition, convinced his colleagues to also drop a prohibition against federal support for `` indecent'' art. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said dropping the word `` indecent'' would leave `` a loophole to people who want to continue to abuse'' the use of tax dollars. But opponents indicated that use of `` indecent'' was vague, with <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> saying his deletion of the word strengthens the measure. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, angry that his amendment appeared about to be watered down, forced the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early today to show its members' individual preferences for the first time on his measure In a vote surprising for its decisiveness, they voted 62-35 against him. The tally, which was a non-binding expression of support, was a reversal of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision two months ago to adopt the ban. Forty-three Democrats and 19 Republicans opposed <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, while 10 Democrats and 25 Republicans supported him. Before the vote, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> remained insistent that the government should decide which works of art it will finance. `` When they start saying to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ` Butt out, just send the money,' this senator says, ` No,''' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. But opponents argued the proposal was too far-reaching. Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., said differences between religions over <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s divinity could be considered offensive and fall under the law's restrictions `` Depictions in this Bible, in any written work, much less 700 years of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> art, can be conceived as being deeply offensive to Jews,'' said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' provision was in a bill that would provide about $ 11 billion for federal land and cultural programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday. The legislation contained other controversial provisions on which lawmakers reached compromises on Thursday. In one instance, they agreed that studies and other activities that would precede oil and gas exploration off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast would be delayed for five months next year. The moratorium was worked out between energy interests and drilling opponents seeking to protect the environment. As has been routine since the early 1980s, the legislation imposes another one-year moratorium on leasing and drilling in federal waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and much of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. Drilling opponents say the five-month delay would help postpone drilling if the moratorium were ever lifted. The negotiators also adopted new restrictions on lobbyists who seek grants and other federal monies for clients. The provisions, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, forbid those lobbyists from being paid with the federal funds they obtain, and requires most of them to file public reports with They reached no deal on the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment Thursday, but moved closer to one. Liberals and conservatives agreed a commission should be established to study how federal arts aid is distributed and whether standards should be set for works to qualify for government funds. But they disagreed over whether they should enact guidelines describing which art is suitable for government assistance before the commission completes its work. The National Endowment for the Arts provided $ 45,000 for two exhibitions that have created an uproar among conservatives. One included an <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> photograph of a crucifix in a bottle of urine, while the other included photos by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> depicting homosexual activities and children in erotic poses. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' amendment on a voice vote July 26 with only a handful of lawmakers in the chamber. The House legislation contained no such language. The amendment would prohibit the use of federal money to exhibit `` obscene or indecent materials, including ... depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts.'' It also bars federal aid for material that `` denigrates'' people based on their religion, race, sex, handicap, age or ethnic origin.

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s second attempt to come back from bankruptcy faces formidible obstacles from major airlines that can afford frequent-flier programs, huge computer networks and elaborate marketing schemes, analysts say. `` The mega-carriers definitely control the game now. If you do n't have a true niche, like <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> or Midway, there's no way to battle the major airlines on the long-haul routes,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, which reported losses of more than $ 1 million a week since February, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code at about 2 a.m. Thursday in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where the carrier relocated its headquarters from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in May. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1982 and emerged two years later with hopes of a rebound. The carrier also has announced plans to cut its work force to about 2,000 from 4,791, including 556 pilots and 1,167 airport personnel. More than half of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s workers are based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, its flight hub. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> `` just ran out of cash,' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which led an investor group that purchased the carrier last year. `` They had some good ideas and viable plans. They just were losing money too quickly.'' Thousands of travelers were left stranded and workers were stunned when <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> canceled all flights Wednesday afternoon. The airline said it is reducing the number of cities it serves from 36 to 11: <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- National -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> also announced it will offer $ 49 one-way tickets between any of the 11 cities starting Monday. The fare will be available through Wednesday. The carrier extended the expiration date of issued tickets until Sept. 27, 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, both subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said they will honor most Braniff tickets. At <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> found out about he canceled flights as she tried to get home to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` I think it's outrageous,'' she said. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Antabades </PERSON> of Grand Prairie, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> that he had a premonition of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles when he bought a ticket for a flight to the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. He remembered the first bankruptcy filing, `` but I said, no, that wo n't happen again.'' Capt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Goduti </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> pilots union, said the bankruptcy filing was a blow to the airline's 900 pilots. `` We've been down this rocky road before,'' he said. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> agent who went through the airline's first Chapter 11 proceeding in 1982, predicted <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> would return, probably as a much smaller carrier `` I am sure we will end up flying out of this one,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 31.8 million on revenue of $ 293 million in the first six months of the year. The financial problems largely were caused by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s relocation to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and its $ 2 billion order for 50 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320 aircraft, industry analysts have said The company recently was unable to complete a $ 75 million financing deal. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> will not cancel its <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> order and will retain its options for 50 more. In May, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> announced plans to expand the work force by 35 percent and build maintenance facilities in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They were losing money. The writing was on the wall, but sometimes you choose not to read the writing,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaskowsky </PERSON>, a professor and airline industry expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've seen it happen at other companies in trouble. People do n't want to believe the worst. You know what they say: hope springs eternal.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s former chief executive who piloted the carrier through bankruptcy proceedings the last time, agreed. `` You could see it coming,'' <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They took on a lot of debt. They began a gigantic expansion in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and they began to lose money. They had been known as a low-fare airline and became a high-fare airline. They got out of their niche.'' <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> tried to build up its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub to capitalize on the void left by strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which was losing millions of dollars a day before filing for Chapter 11 protection on March 9. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had operated 93 daily departures from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 South Carolinans showed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> roofless buildings, decimated forests and other legacies of Hugo today, while the president defended his administration's handling of aid to the storm's victims. `` I do know that there's been a critic or two _ that's less than I would have expected. But to the critics I simply say I understand. We are trying very hard,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> at the end of his two-hour visit. Before touching down at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a $ 1.1 billion relief package approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. He was greeted on his arrival by Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the latter of whom had criticized a planned aerial tour by the president as being too removed from the people. However, bad weather forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to travel by motorcade through <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>, an inland town 22 miles northwest, which suffered major utility and timber damage. Summerville Mayor <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the grounds of the <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> littered with fallen trees, smashed vehicles and twisted metal. The president, patting the mayor on the shoulder, said, `` Why am I here? I'm here to give a little encouragement to a courageous man.'' The weather cleared enough by midmorning for a 15-minute helicopter tour of the coast. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters of some chats he had with <PERSON> Summerville </PERSON> residents. `` One thing that touched me very much was a young homeowner there saying that he had had offers of help from all over this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think it does bring out the very best in the men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who want to help in a tragedy of this nature.'' The president then departed for an engagement in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md. Before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, a Democrat, had complained: `` Airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice but everything is on the ground. The buildings are on the ground, the people are on the ground, the stress is on the ground and we need a president who is on the ground.'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said it was `` absolutely ridiculous'' that only two federal disaster claims offices have opened in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has opened five claims offices across the state to serve 17 counties that have been declared disaster areas. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today the president would increase the number of <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to nine. There were long lines at those offices Thursday as thousands of people applied for grants and low-interest loans to help cover storm losses not covered by insurance. An angry Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, also criticized <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got to make sure everything possible has been done at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> level. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is still the bottleneck,'' he said. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>, a Republican whose district includes <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, blamed partisan politics for some of the criticism. `` It's very easy to find fault and point fingers,'' <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said, adding he believed <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> was moving as fast as it could to speed storm relief to the state. Meanwhile, an insurance group estimated Thursday that Hugo caused $ 2.5 billion in insured losses in the state. The preliminary figure, released by the <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, does not include uninsured losses, state-insured property, marine and harbor facilities, aircraft, utility equipment or public property such as roads and bridges. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on environmental protection today that the damage from Hugo probably will total $ 2 billion and `` I would n't be surprised if it was much more.'' <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> residents were somewhat lucky in the path the Sept. 21 storm took, Sheets said, since <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s maximum strength struck just north of the city in the <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, where few people live. Meanwhile, aid continued to flood in from around the nation _ shipments included 5,000 cases of baby food, four tons of pet food and a ton of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> catfish. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it had donated $ 42 million to aid hurricane victims in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and on the mainland, making it the largest relief effort in the organization's history. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> officials have opened a hotline to obtain the services of contractors and artisans to help rebuild historic buildings, and artisans from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> have arrived. About 75 percent of the 3,500 city structures deemed of historical value were damaged in the storm, city historians said. The death toll from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was 29 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 18 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The storm is blamed for 33 deaths in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Animals also fell prey to the fury of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135 mph winds, The News and Courier of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, home to a number of endangered and threatened species, lost an undetermined number of animals, its visitor's center and dock, according to refuge manager <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garris </PERSON>. The storm also swept away 50 years of refuge records, including nest counts of loggerhead sea turtles, a threatened species. On Bull's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ part of the refuge _ at least two red wolves survived, <PERSON> Garris </PERSON> said. Transmitters in the collars of the endangered wolves show the male and one of his five daughters are moving around the island. The other four female pups do n't appear to have changed position since before the storm. At least 203,000 power customers remain without power, more than half of those in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said power had been restored to about 20 percent of the city. The Charleston International Airport reopened Thursday. Although the concourses were n't open because of storm damage, 20 incoming and outgoing commercial flights used the facility.

 The owner of a Greek tanker that ran aground and spilled thousands of gallons of heating oil off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> in June was fined $ 500,000 today, and a federal judge ruled the captain must pay $ 10,000. The captain, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> each pleaded guilty Aug. 16 to one count of violating the federal Clean Water Act in connection with the June 21 spill of nearly 300,000 gallons of oil at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> company, promised to pay $ 500,000 to the state for environmental research and park acquisiton. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, who left court without comment, agreed to the $ 10,000 fine to avoid jail or probation. Each misdemeanor count carried a possible year in jail and fines of up to double the actual damages. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, as part of a plea agreement, said it would pay up to $ 1 million, but with half of that suspended. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said he would not jail <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> because the captain had cooperated with investigators and his actions were `` negligent, as opposed to willful or reckless.'' `` I think we were right on the mark'' with the plea bargain, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON>. `` We're sending a message to the industry for reform ... and corporate responsiblity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has estimated cleanup costs at $ 3 million. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>'s insurance company has guaranteed a total of $ 3.2 million to the state and federal governments for environmental damage.

<TEXT>
 Timing and a little luck helped quash a smoky fire that caused evacuation of the 101-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> but no injuries and relatively minor damage. The fire started Thursday in a basement air-handling unit and pumped enough smoke up air vents to fill the two-story-tall <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber with a foul-smelling haze. But firefighters, who arrived 90 seconds after the first call, cleared the building and extinguished the three-alarm fire within an hour. `` We were lucky that the fire was detected early, it was during daytime hours and people were in the Capitol'' to report it, said Lt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. That contrasted with an early morning blaze in February 1983 that gutted parts of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wing of the historic building and nearly claimed the entire structure. Fire Capt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said cork insulation in the air-handling unit caught fire about 4:30 p.m. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Battalion Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Teasdale </PERSON> said he had reports that a work was being done in the basement and `` there may have been a spark from a welding torch.'' However, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the State Purchasing and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains the building, said the workers were in another part of the basement. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said today that firefighters had no estimate of the number of people evacuated or a damage estimate for the building. The capitol was closed this morning as officials awaited results of air monitoring tests to determine if any areas were contaminated by asbestos. Firefighters had to cut through asbestos to extinguish the fire.

 English actor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> has made a powerful addition to film portrayals of the handicapped with his performance as a victim of cerebral palsy in `` My Left Foot,'' previewed to warm applause at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Film Festival. <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> -LRB- `` Rain Man'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Men'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Miracle Worker'' -RRB- have all won acclaim playing characters with severe mental or physical disabilities, and <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> already has won best actor honors at the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. `` My Left Foot'' traces the story of Irish author and painter <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who manages an intense, well-rounded life despite brain damage, badly impaired speech and the use of only his left foot. The film's title comes from <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s first book. <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> plays the adult <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 13-year-old <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Conor </PERSON> portrays him as a child. Producer <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> were friends of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who died in 1981 at age 49 after choking on a piece of meat. `` I knew <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for a long time and he did n't consider himself crippled,'' said <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, who recently appeared with <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> at a post-screening news conference. `` He considered others crippled because they could n't understand what he was trying to say.'' `` Meeting <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is the equivalent to meeting a large jumbo jet tearing down the runway without taking off,'' added <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, making his directorial debut with `` My Left Foot.'' The 32-year-old <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> has displayed remarkable range, portraying a gay punk in `` My Beautiful Launderette,'' a prissy suitor in `` A Room With a View'' and a seductive physician in `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being.'' In `` My Left Foot,'' he conveys the frustrations of a brilliant man struggling for understanding, rolling his eyes and contorting his face to convey love, humor and despair. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was able to write and paint with his left foot and <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> practiced daily to master the same skills. `` About 18 months ago, I appeared at a party for ` Stars and Bars,' which <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> was in,'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. `` As the night wore on, the drinks got thicker and the spirits got better. I talked about <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for 20 minutes and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> did n't say a word. I thought I was boring him.'' But <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> was interested, and <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> were so happy to have him they completed filming in seven weeks to fit the actor's schedule. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was one of 22 children _ 13 survived _ and `` My Left Foot,'' shot mostly in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, used several siblings as extras. `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> was afraid they'd see him and say, ` That's not <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> said. `` But when they saw the film, they said, `` That's not <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>, that was our <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> up there.'' `` My Left Foot'' will open theatrically Nov. 3, and is being released by <ORGANIZATION> Miramax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION>, which also has put out `` sex, lies, and videotape,'' `` Scandal'' and `` The Thin Blue Line.''

 Police are checking out the checks they accept as bail a little more closely these days after a check-forging suspect allegedly stuck them with a bad one. `` It's a little embarrassing,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a supervisor at the Police Department's Van Nuys Jail. The phony check that landed <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> in jail had the same serial numbers as the one that briefly got him out, county Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, 32, was charged Wednesday with five counts of felony forgery, including one count of giving the police a fake cashiers check to cover his $ 1,500 bail on the other four counts. Authorities said a desk officer did n't notice that the check <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> allegedly used to get out of jail on Sept. 6 was dated four days before his arrest. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> was arrested later that day after police took a closer look at the check.

 Ten men convicted by an Islamic court of child abuse or murder were beheaded in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. Six of the criminals had kidnapped minors for burglaries, highway robberies and `` acts of abuse,'' the statement said without elaborating. The six, all Saudis, were tried and executed in the capital, <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. The other four convicts killed a man, stole his money and then murdered an accomplice, the statement said. The men were from <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and were executed in the southwestern part of the kingdom. About 1 million Yemenis live in the kingdom. The announcement cited a ruling in the Koran, the holy book of Islam, that criminals should be beheaded. Friday's executions followed the beheading of 16 Kuwaitis last Thursday. They had been convicted of terrorism in connection with two bomb attacks in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> at the height of the pilgrimage season last July. The bomb explosions killed one Pakistani pilgrim and wounded 16. In recorded confessions aired after their executions, the Kuwaitis, all Shiite Moslems, claimed they had been trained and equipped in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> by Iranian officials. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied the charge and said the executions were unjustified. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday, about 1,000 supporters of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> chanted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, death to the Saudi clan,'' and vowed to avenge the execution of the 16 Shiites. `` May the wrath of Allah fall on the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> clan,'' chanted the demonstrators, who were led by a dozen turbaned clergymen marching behind huge posters of the late Iranian spiritual leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. They burned effigies representing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Saudi King Fahd.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> marched through town Friday with 22 empty spaces in its formation to honor the band members killed or wounded in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb attack one week ago.

The band, normally 70 strong, observed a two-minute silence near the spot where the bomb went off before setting off through Deal, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. Security was extremely tight, with armed police on the route. `` The sacrifice of our magnificent musicians will not be in vain,'' said Commandant General of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, Lt.

Among the marches played was `` Aces High,'' which the band had practiced just before the bomb exploded.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Friday she has forgiven <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for the murder of her husband but can not permit the late president to be buried here because it would trigger domestic unrest. The government put troops and police on alert after the 72-year-old former president died Thursday in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. There were no major demonstrations by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters. Leaders of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> met to map strategy for forcing Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow their former leader to be buried in his homeland. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the ban, said <PERSON> Nicanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yniguez </PERSON>, former speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and a prominent pro-Marcos leader. `` Can a dead man destabilize a government that always claims to be stable?'' <PERSON> Yniguez </PERSON> asked. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said officials would periodically review the ban and could lift it in the future. `` We believe that allowing the remains of the late president to be brought back here would cause some instability and would discourage very much investors and tourists from coming here, plus also dividing the people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a nationally televised news conference. `` For my part, I have forgiven Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' she added. `` But it is not just a question of forgiving. As president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, it is my duty to see to it that the security and welfare of the Filipino people is assured.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has blamed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for the August 1983 assassination of her husband, Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was shot to death as he arrived at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport to end three years of self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' rule. Forty people, mostly soldiers, are on trial for the slaying. Following the announcement of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death, military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the nation was calm and `` we have not seen anything that is abnormal in the country.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she took power Feb. 25, 1986, after a popular uprising ended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who came to power three years ago in the uprising that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, ordered <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flags flown at half-staff until Sunday on government buildings. She said the government would send a representative to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' funeral if he is buried in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, said she would continue efforts to return her husband to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> called Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision `` so cruel, so inhuman and so immoral.'' She said there were no immediate plans for burial. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' brother, <PERSON> Pacifico </PERSON>, joined family friends and relatives for a Roman Catholic Mass at a suburban <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> church. Later, about 300 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters held a vigil in front of the armed forces headquarters compound. In <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' home province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, about 200 people attended a vigil at the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family home in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, 230 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Loyalists planned Masses on Saturday but had no plans for large demonstrations. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had refused to let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attend the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4, 1988, or the burial of his sister, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keon </PERSON>, who died in December 1986.

<TEXT>
 The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced next Thursday, and right now <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> could use a little peace. `` We do n't get anything done because the phone is always ringing,'' said <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kjellberg </PERSON>, office manager for the institute. The winner of the 70th Peace Prize has been decided, but as usual, the name is kept secret until the formal announcement, despite a stream of telephone calls from the curious, said <PERSON> Jakop </PERSON> <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON>, institute director. `` It does n't do any good ... we never tell,'' he said in an interview. The selection committee is not swayed by lobbyists or by thousands of letters promoting favorites among candidates, this year numbering 90, <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> agreed. `` We look at some letters, but rise above that kind of influence and look at other criteria,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The prize, first awarded in 1901, is worth $ 385,000 this year. Most people who lobby the committee seek the prestige of the prize for their candidate or organization. But one man just wanted the cash. `` Once a man, who clearly had problems, asked what he could do to get the prize. He said he had n't done anything for world peace but could really use the money,'' said <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON>. `` He offered to split the prize money if I could get him the prize,'' <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON> said. The man was never considered. Candidates may be nominated by previous laureates, members of parliaments or political science faculty members of selected universities. When delegations come to campaign for legitimate candidates `` we listen to what they have to say and bid them farewell. It does n't have any effect,'' <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON> said Letters also clog the institute's austere <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> office `` but we do n't take them into account,'' he said. `` We do spend a lot of time sorting mail,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kjellberg </PERSON>. `` Many people, some with tragic stories, write asking for the money. They do n't understand the prize.'' The Nobel laureate is chosen by a five-member committee elected by the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to six-year terms. The institute, which has five permanent employees, maintains a library and provides the committee with meeting rooms and research facilities. The committee meets six or seven times a year. No notes leave the room, no list of candidates is made available, and the committee's deliberations are, by law, kept secret for 50 years. <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON> said secrecy protects candidates, sometimes keeping details of their activities from their home governments. Each year <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s media try to guess the winner. This year bets are on Czech human rights activists <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajak </PERSON> or <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>; imprisoned South African activist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>; Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` This year's choice will be criticized ... they always are,'' <PERSON> Svedrup </PERSON> said. The prize will be presented in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of benefactor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the inventor of dynamite. Last year the prize went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. Other recent winners were Polish Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, South African Bishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>. There have been 19 years in which no prize was awarded. Nobel, a Swede, never explained why he picked <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Parliament to award the Peace Prize The Nobel prizes for literature, chemistry, and physics are awarded in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and will be announced in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> later in October. Some believe Nobel wished to ease tensions between the neighboring countries, which were under one crown when he wrote his will in 1895. The union dissolved in 1905. Nobel hoped his 1867 invention of dynamite would prove to be a powerful weapon that would deter war and bring peace. `` My dynamite factories may well put an end to war sooner than your -LRB- peace -RRB- conferences,'' he wrote to a friend and peace activist in 1892. `` The day when two army corps can annihilate one another in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops.''

<HEAD>Pet Lobster Seized; Kids Cry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKSVILLE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who is in hot water after being caught with an oversize lobster says `` Herb'' was a pet and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officers went too far when they seized the 10-pound crustacean and made two boys cry. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorker </LOCATION> and summer resident of this Down East town, said Friday he would not mind paying the $ 71.50 fine for lobster fishing without a license. But he pleaded innocent at arraignment Thursday. `` The reason I'm scrapping about it is that I think it is quite silly bothering children over a benign act,'' <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON> said. He said two officers confiscated <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> earlier this month from the submersible box where his sons <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Clement </PERSON>, 8, had kept it for about seven years. `` They cried their eyes out,'' said <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON>. He recalled his younger son telling him, `` Daddy, police are supposed to help you, not make you cry.'' <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON> said he does not know where <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> was taken, `` but we hope he's not in someone's stomach.'' Messages left Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> were not returned immediately. A secretary said no officers were available at the <LOCATION> Ellsworth </LOCATION> field office, and referred calls to <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> lived on seafood fed by his `` family.'' `` He loved pogies,'' a fish used for bait and oil, said <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON>. `` He loved dogfish. He could eat a 3-foot dogfish in less than a week, and he would eat everything but the teeth.'' <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> also loved to be scratched while lying on the dock, preferably with mussel shells _ and that is what ultimately led to <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON>'s citation. Officers spotted the lobster earlier this month. Later, two officers came to <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON>'s home and demanded identification so they could cite him, <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON> said he tried to find a new home for <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> at aquariums but failed, and the officers later confiscated the lobster. Technically, <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON> is accused of lobster fishing with the wooden box his sons used to catch crabs, said <PERSON> Benenson </PERSON>. His lawyer, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, said he hopes to work out an agreement with prosecutors `` in as amicable a way as possible.'' `` On a scale of crime from one to 1,000, this is a one half,'' said <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified today that the fund-raising technique at the heart of his fraud and conspiracy trial occurred to him in the middle of the night as `` a vision or a dream.'' `` I think fund-raising was my most burdensome job,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified. `` It never left me. You never ever, ever get away from the pressure that you have to raise funds for next week, next month, next year.'' When he left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, the budget was $ 160 million a year, `` which I think boils down to $ 3 million a week,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. Under questioning by defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> described the roots of his PTL ministry in a low voice. At one point, when he looked at <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the lawyer pointed for him to look directly at the jury. Neither his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, nor his two children, were in the courtroom when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified. After describing his early years as an evangelist, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> talked about his vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA Chrsitian retreat. `` The vision from God was to build a modern Christian campground where people could worship, attend seminars and workshops,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. As the ministry grew, he said, `` we needed to build. In the middle of the night I woke up. It was a vision or a dream, I do n't know God gave me the concept of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and I began to sketch it.'' He later described the same event. `` I woke up in the morning and began to write down the concept of lifetime partnerships. I brought the concept to my staff and showed it to some vice presidents and accountants. I asked them if it would work and they said yes.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of bilking followers of $ 158 million through the sale of the $ 1,000 partnerships, which typically entitled holders to three nights' lodging a year in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> hotels near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Defense attorneys have claimed the partnerships were not sales transactions and that the money paid for them constituted gifts to the ministry. In their presentation, prosecutors presented several <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> partners who said they sometimes were turned away when they tried to use their lodging benefits. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> oversold partnerships and diverted $ 3.7 million of the money to himself. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from his ministry in a sex and money scandal in 1987 and is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than $ 5 million if found guilty on all the charges. Defense attorneys on Thursday continued their parade of witnesses testifying to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s character. By the end of the day's court session, at least 72 defense witnesses testified, more than 50 of whom said they continue to have faith in <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and described him as a man of God <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> clashed with defense attorneys Wednesday over the number of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s witnesses. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he usually allows only five character witnesses during a trial, but defense attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said the witnesses were satisfied backers important to his case. Jurors heard Thursday from satisfied partners. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Creech </PERSON>, a school teacher from <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, described her stay at Heritage Grand Hotel as `` the next best thing to being ... close to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinney </PERSON> testified she recently changed her will to leave her entire estate to the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>. Since the defense began its case Sept. 20, defense attorneys also have shown the jury videotapes of seven PTL programs.

<HEAD>Pen Shop to Close, and With it Another Patch of England</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s favorite purveyor of pens, nibs and peacock feathers, is closing shop, and with him goes another little piece of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> is giving up his <ORGANIZATION> Drury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> shop in the heart of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s theater district, forced out by a rent hike from $ 9,900 to $ 32,000 a year It may be inevitable in this age of supermarkets, word processors and ballpoint pens. But to lovers of tradition and good service, it is a tragedy. The closing of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s is being recorded wistfully in newspapers and television, and customers are flocking in to buy up supplies for the lean years ahead. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, 79, is so well-known in his field that he is nicknamed His Nibs. For 56 years, he has sold and repaired pens for cartoonists, artists and practitioners of penmanship. But the store that bears <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s name sits on some of the choicest real estate in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and a sudden tripling of the rent is not unusual. `` Everyone's desperately sorry,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenland </PERSON>, the secretary of the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Writing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> founded in 1979 and still chairs. `` He's one of the old school, with an old-fashioned shop with reasonable prices and a unique kind of service. He has perfect background knowledge of the history of writing equipment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Greenland </PERSON> said. With eight weeks to move, <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> is selling the remains of an inventory of 5,000 fountain pens and 500,000 pen tips. He says his future plans are uncertain, but he does n't want to retire. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s wisps of white hair are held in place by half glasses. He wears a white coat, and a small white quill pen is embroidered on his navy blue tie. He modestly admits there's no shop quite like <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s, where each sale is entered into a spiral notebook and mahogany drawers holding thousands of tiny pen nibs occupy all available surfaces. `` It's a specialized business,'' said <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, as he counted a customer's change from a gray strongbox that serves as the cash register. `` There's too little turnover for a modern store that likes quick selling. They'd never be able to stock all of these. One or two nibs would drive them mad.'' Music copyist <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> came in and bought 20 nibs. `` I hope this will tide me over for a few years,'' he said. What will he do when they run out? `` I do n't know.'' Five peacock feathers remain unsold. `` Some people use peacock feathers for drawing, but I ca n't see why,'' said <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. `` One woman told me she liked them because you ca n't control their movement. Must be for abstract pictures.'' Ironically, the store is closing at a time when fountain pens are enjoying a renaissance. They appeal to the nostalgia market as well as to business people looking for symbols of solidity in a throwaway culture. `` It's a reaction against computers,'' said <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, citing a managing director of a computer firm who came in recently to buy a pen. `` He told me that if he really wants to get his workers' attention, he issues a handwritten memo. Ms. <PERSON> Greenland </PERSON> said many of her society's members are tourists who chanced upon <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>'s shop and were so enchanted they paid the $ 16 to join. `` It's a tragedy really,'' she said. `` He obviously does n't have all the time in the world and he should really go on and on. It's dreadful that he has to leave without any choice.

<TEXT>
 Support for <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has dwindled steadily since he was ousted in a civilian-military uprising three years ago, and few believe his followers are strong enough to topple his successor, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Still, President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refuses to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who died Thursday in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, to be buried here because she said the funeral might trigger `` destabilization efforts.'' Her adamant stand reflects a fear among senior officials that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' well-financed followers can create enough trouble to discredit the government and frighten off foreign investors needed to help rebuild the country's debt-ridden economy. In a country where public opinion surveys are notoriously unreliable, it is difficult to determine the extent of support for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who ruled this country for 20 years, longer than any <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president. But the results of elections held since 1986 _ as well as the turnout in recent pro-Marcos rallies _ indicate a decline in the number of hardcore <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters. After the February 1986 uprising that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the late president's followers could muster up to 10,000 people for rallies demanding the return of the man they considered their legitimate president. But in recent months, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists have been able to attract only a few hundred participants. Many are middle-aged men and women from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> island stronghold. None of the candidates clearly identified as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the May 1987 congressional balloting. Nineteen avowed pro-Marcos politicians were elected to the 200-member House of Representatives. Unlike the 24 senators who were elected in nationwide balloting, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were elected by district, indicating scattered pockets of support for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, particularly in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters are organized into about 30 different factions, including the `` Ako' y Pilipino,'' or `` I am a Filipino'' group, and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the party <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> organized. One source with close ties to the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> movement, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated that up to a million of the 58 million Filipinos were either members of pro-Marcos groups or supported them. That represents a sizeable political base, and already politicians are jockeying for control of the movement. Candidates for the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> mantel include Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s estranged cousin who fled to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was overthrown. Division within the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> camp may be in part responsible for the delay in organizing the protests that were widely anticipated after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death. After <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ouster, the peak of the loyalist movement was the June 1986 takeover of the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Hotel. Troops loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> seized the hotel and declared the former president's 1986 running mate, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolentino </PERSON>, as acting president. The mutineers, who were receiving instructions by telephone from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, surrendered about 40 hours later. In January 1987, pro-Marcos troops seized a radio-television station and held out for about 60 hours before surrendering. Afterward, the government claimed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was preparing to leave <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> secretly for <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in case the coup attempt succeeded. The base of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' support is in the Ilocano-speaking areas of the north, which includes the late president's birthplace, <PERSON> Sarrat </PERSON>, and the family's ancestral home, <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>. Other <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> strongholds include scattered areas of the central <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> islands and <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> _ mostly in districts controlled by warlords with whom the former president forged alliances. But the deepest sympathy for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is in the Ilocano regions of the north. Filipino culture requires special loyalty to members of one's own linguistic group or province. Ilocanos, a strongly clannish group, number about 6 million and are the third-largest linguistic group in a country where more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken. Ilocanos are strongly represented within the Philippine military. Figures on their numbers are unavailable, but reporters covering the August 1987 coup attempt, led by renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, heard many of the mutineers speaking Ilocano.

<TEXT>
 The Army suspended the firing of mortars at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> while it determines what caused the explosion that killed two soldiers handling one of the weapons. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, were investigating Thursday's accident in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and another accident the day before at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, where an errant artillery shell killed three soldiers and wounded 24. There was no relationship between the accidents, which involved different types of weapons, said Lt. Colonel <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanks </PERSON>, public affairs officer for the safety center. The 4.2-inch mortar that exploded could have been faulty, or one of the victims might have made an error setting the timing fuse on the device, said Maj. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON>, a Fort <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> spokesman. `` At this point, we really do n't know what happened, but they were the ones handling the munitions,'' <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said. A mortar is a short-barreled cannon that can be fired from a position on the ground or from fittings aboard a vehicle. Its shell contains shrapnel. During training exercises, <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said, mortar tubes are loaded by two-person teams. One team member sights the weapon and the other loads the explosive propellant and drops the round into the muzzle. The propellant is designed to detonate when the shell hits the bottom of the mortar tube. It was not known at what point the shell exploded in Thursday's accident At <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>, a four-man team of investigators picked their way through the accident scene, pulling shrapnel from trees and nearby buildings and poking at a 2-foot wide, 1-foot deep crater left by the stray shell. Three types of howitzers _ 105mm, 155mm and 8-inch guns _ were being used in target practice at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Investigators must determine which gun the shell came from, and whether the firing error was human or mechanical, said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennies </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> safety for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it's human, it could be in standards, in training, in leaders, in individuals or any combination thereof,'' <PERSON> Hennies </PERSON> said. `` We're not in the blaming process ... for punitive measures This is preventive.'' Post officials said the explosion occurred 700 to 1,000 meters beyond the target site. The shell landed about 10 yards from where a group of trainees had lined in formation, preparing to move to their next exercise. The army identified those killed by the blast as Pvt. 1 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, 21, of Troy, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; Pvt. 1 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zastrow </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Lester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and Spec. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>.

 A 2 -LCB- - year-old girl whose abduction was being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was freed unharmed today, and the boyfriend of the child's mother was one of three people taken into custody, police said The girl was reported missing Wednesday night and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials had said her captors had threatened to harm her if their ransom demand was not quickly met. The child was found after the 28-year-old boyfriend picked up the girl's mother and drove her to <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, said Police Chief <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>. Five unmarked police cars followed, he said. In <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, police stopped the car and questioned the driver, who told them the child was being held at a <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said. Officers then went to the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> and found two other people and the child, he said. The child was not harmed and was turned over peacefully, and the two others surrendered without incident at about 2:15 a.m., he said. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> police do not intend to file kidnapping charges against the boyfriend, but that he may seek charges of interference with child custody against the three. He would not elaborate on the charges. The girl and her mother lived in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, a town of 8,400 west of <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Madison is about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> told the newspaper it appeared the boyfriend had been baby-sitting the girl Wednesday night and had taken her bar-hopping with two other friends. The boyfriend's car broke down in Madison and the two friends stayed with the girl while the boyfriend hitchhiked back to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, police said. None of three people involved admitted placing a ransom call, police said. The child's mother told police Thursday she received a call from a woman demanding a ransom of $ 3,000 for the return of her child, police said. The three arrested included a 28-year-old <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> man, a 27-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> man and a 20-year-old <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> woman. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said the mother knew two of the suspects. The boyfriend was being held this morning in <LOCATION> Dane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> while the two others were taken to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> police lockup. The three suspects were to meet with the <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor this afternoon to discuss charges in the case. `` It's not the normal, run-of-the-mill kidnapping situation,'' <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday they had made contact with the abductors and threats were made that the child would be harmed if a ransom demand was not made. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> did not immediately return calls to his <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> office today. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said there would be no federal charges.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court today lifted a trial stay in the case of a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief accused of lying to investigators looking into the Iran-Contra dealings of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not have standing to intervene in the case over the objections of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The panel dismissed the department's appeal, which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had challenged as amounting to an effort to wrest control of the Iran-Contra case from his office. `` We are, of course, gratified by their decision, and we will proceed with the case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the attorney general have been locked in a feud over how to proceed against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The dispute, on which the appeals court heard testimony Aug. 23, involves protecting classified documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is studying whether to appeal further, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. `` We're reviewing the various options, which the department has at this time,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The options include seeking a rehearing of the case by the same three-judge panel, the full 4th Circuit or going to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. In addition, `` there is the option of discussing this with the independent counsel to see if we could resolve the issue there,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the same issue after a federal appellate court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> found that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could not intervene on secrecy issues in the trial of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide. But the case before the high court was dropped when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> resolved their differences, allowing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial to proceed He was convicted of three charges arising from his efforts to cover up the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was charged in April with two counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office and the Tower commission. That three-member board was appointed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to investigate the diversion to the Nicaraguan rebels of proceeds from the sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In July, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> ruled that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> could disclose, as part of his defense, the location of several <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and details of secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs. The Classified Information Procedures Act, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to address situations in which a criminal defendant threatens to reveal government secrets during trial, gives the government the authority to challenge such revelations, the 4th Circuit panel said. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office wanted to use an affidavit with the trial court to block disclosure of the classified information. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> pressed for a pre-trial appeal of <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s rulings According to the 4th Circuit, the government in this case is the independent counsel, not the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. An independent prosecutor is not independent if the department can exercise supervision or intefere with his decisions, the panel said. The pre-trial appeal right is important in limiting judicial errors that might affect a prosecution's outcome, the panel said. `` Independent counsel must be able to decide when and whether to use this device,'' the panel said. The court said it had to reconcile the Ethics in Government Act, which allows the use of such counsel to prosecute high-ranking executive branch officials, and the classified information statute, neither of which refer to each other. The panel also said its decision should be narrowly interpreted and that the attorney general has other powers closely related to protecting government secrets, including the right to file an affidavit prohibiting such disclosures.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Forecast Continued Economic Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Friday that its chief forecasting gauge turned up in August for the second straight month, another sign the nation's economy is likely to grow, albeit modestly, at least into next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators climbed 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in July and falling 0.1 percent in June. The back-to-back July-August advance was consistent with expectations of many analysts who foresee the current economic expansion reaching its seventh birthday in December and continuing into 1990. Some had thought the expansion might be curtailed this year by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to control inflation by tightening credit and thus slowing the economy. But as inflation responded, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has eased its grip, permitting the economic growth to continue but at a slower pace. The leading indicators are a mix of 11 forward-looking business statistics designed to predict economic activity six to nine months into the future. The index has risen four times this year and declined four, prompting <PERSON> Ysabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to observe: `` This trendless result for 1989 seems consistent with the slow growth experience of the overall economy.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON>, chief domestic economist for the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday's report shows `` continued growth, but not robust and not terribly weak.'' `` It's sort of a middle-of-the-road expansion and that's consistent with the other data we're getting,'' he said `` The notion that the economy is sliding into a recession has been rejected by the data ... what we're getting is relatively modest growth.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, senior economic adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, also forecasts continued economic expansion, but adds, `` It wo n't be very buoyant growth.'' `` I think if we're going to have a recession it probably wo n't start before -LRB- the expansion's birthday in December -RRB- and I still think we will squeeze through 1990 without one,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said Five of the indicators contributed to the August gain _ an increase in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, higher stock prices, an increase in the money supply, lower initial unemployment claims and increased building permits. Six others pointed down _ a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; lower prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand; a decrease in manufactuers' unfilled orders; fewer orders for new plants and equipment; faster vendor deliveries, meaning declining demand; and a shorter work week. <PERSON> Annable </PERSON> noted the drop in consumer expectations but said the decline was from a relatively high level and is expected to rebound. `` What we're getting right now is a little mini-consumer boom,'' he said, pointing to recent increase in auto sales and a turn-around in home sales and related purchases of home-furnishing goods. Lawrence A. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, deputy chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the August indicators `` show that the economic slowdown should come to an end in the fourth quarter ... and the real gross national product should rise throughout 1990.'' The GNP grew 3.1 percent on an annual basis during the first half of 1989, but is expected to slow during the second half. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration forecasts a 2.9 percent growth rate for the year, meaning the economy would need to expand only at a 2.3 percent annual rate to meet that goal.

 Fourteen years after a 75-year-old `` bag lady'' was bludgeoned to death with a stick of firewood in her one-room shack, police using computerized fingerprints have arrested a paroled felon. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON>, 32, of College Park pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of murder and armed robbery in the 1975 death of <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON>. Retired Detective <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronebarger </PERSON>, who investigated the case in 1975, described Mrs. <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON> as an eccentric `` bag lady'' who lived alone without electricity or indoor plumbing. Authorities, meanwhile, have called <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON>'s arrest one of the most dramatic successes of the new fingerprint system since it was installed at the beginning of this year. `` It's the first one of this magnitude of this age _ where the fingerprint is 14 years old,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGreevy </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. Last week when the police technician who originally worked the slaying took fingerprints found at the 1975 crime scene to the <ORGANIZATION> GBI </ORGANIZATION>'s new computer. And on Friday the machine matched fingerprints taken when <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON> entered prison with prints lifted from Mrs. <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON>'s cashbox and a kerosene lantern after the slaying. <PERSON> Fronebarger </PERSON> said that in 1975 police manually searched without success through more than 200 fingerprints for a match to those found at the scene. Yet police said the $ 6 million Automated Fingerprint Identification System whizzed out a fingerprint match in just 20 minutes, after starting a check through the 3.75 million prints on file. <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said that on Wednesday, police arrested <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON>, who had been on parole after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 1985 death of his wife, <PERSON> Libby </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The goodwill resulting from a thaw in relations between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is spreading from people to dogs. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, a three-time winner of the 1,100-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, was to leave Friday for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> along with a veterinarian and two <ORGANIZATION> Iditarod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> officials. The group has three goals: _ Find two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> mushers who would live in <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION> with Butcher and her husband, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>, another winning musher, and learn the ropes about sled dog racing, Alaska-style. _ Examine sled dogs used in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for size and stamina comparisons with their <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> counterparts. _ Organize a committee on the Soviet side of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> that would help lay out a route for a new, international sled dog race which would start in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and end in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, after contestants had been flown across the strait. <PERSON> Ginna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brelsford </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> Expedition which traveled 1,000 miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, helped arrange this week-long trip. `` All that sounds easy, but it's amazing how much time it takes to get things done over there,'' <PERSON> Brelsford </PERSON> said of the goals for Butcher's trip. The Soviets are no strangers to using dogs in the Arctic, but they lag far behind the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in developing racing equipment and techniques, she said. `` When we introduced our sleds, they were excited about how light and how flexible they were and how easily they could be taken apart,'' <PERSON> Brelsford </PERSON> said of her trek last spring. `` They still operate with heavy leather harnesses and use ivory hooks to connect things. Their technology is old when it comes to using dogs and sleds.'' `` Generally, they use freight animals _ dogs bigger than what you see running the Iditarod but not necessarily better,'' <PERSON> Brelsford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> and Butcher have 120 dogs in their <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION> kennel, but <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> said they always are looking for new bloodlines. `` Anything that will improve the general makeup of a sled dog so it would perform better would be of interest,'' <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> said. The new race would be operated separately from the Iditarod, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, executive director of the race established in 1973. `` We will not be taking anything from the Iditarod Sled Dog Race to put this on, excepting experience,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` We've had very positive responses from mushers _ lots and lots of calls wondering how they could enter.'' The race would be run about the end of March, at least two weeks after the winner of the Iditarod crosses the finish line in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, she said. `` Mushers are a sturdy bunch. You might see much the same teams in there from the Iditarod.'' The route would be from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. From there, mushers and dogs would be flown across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> for a restart in <LOCATION> Uelen </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and the eventual finish at <LOCATION> Anadyr </LOCATION>, she said. `` We would love to do it in 1990,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` Realistically speaking, it probably will be 1991.'' The group also will be recruiting Soviet mushers and teams for the Iditarod. `` Things like this just serve to break down the barriers,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` It's making the world smaller.''

<HEAD>Giuliani Ad Points up Jackson Support of Dinkins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An advertisement aimed at Jewish voters placed by mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> showing opponent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was called racist by some Jewish leaders. The charges come on top of remarks made earlier in the week by comedian <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a strong <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> backer in the Jewish community, that were considered racially offensive. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s role in the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign ended Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> reported his remarks. The ad that rekindled the controversy sends the Jewish community New Year's greetings for <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON> and asks New Yorkers to `` choose'' their destiny. The ad was paid for by `` Friends of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'' and appeared in The <ORGANIZATION> Algemeiner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest Yiddish newspaper The head of the local <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> denounced the ad, calling it `` an ill-disguised appeal to prejudice.'' But officials with <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s campaign defended it. `` This has absolutely nothing to do with race or prejudice,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager. `` It has to do with who are the candidates' political supporters.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is strong on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is weak on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON> said. The ad's banner says `` Let the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> choose their own destiny,'' and has photographs of Republican <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a former Democratic presidential contender. After the primary Sept. 12, when <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> beat incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> called <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> `` a Reagan Republican.'' That prompted the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney to call him a `` Jackson Democrat.'' `` What they're trying to do now is inject -LRB- racism -RRB- into the campaign and that's unfortunate,'' said <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazere </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> chapter of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish Committee. The ad was `` a guilt by association number'' and `` a scare appeal,'' he said. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the ads show `` it seems pretty clear what he's attempting to do. He did not elaborate. The ad reinforces earlier attempts by the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign to point out <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' links with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s disfavor with many Jews goes back to a reference in 1984 to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown,'' a remark for which he later apologized. He also supports Palestinian self-determination and has received support from <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> of the Nation of Islam.

 Trying to keep up with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on flashy arms control proposals is child's play compared to finding an opening for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, capitalizing on Soviet concessions that were brought about by an ailing economy, has drawn about even with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in proposing formulas to cap the nuclear arms race. A treaty to sharply reduce long-range bombers, missiles and submarines could be ready for signing at next year's summit meeting. The two sides are not far apart, either, in their proposals to reduce troops, tanks and combat aircraft in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and now chemical weapons, too. But when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> turn to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> they are hip-deep in muddle. The Arabs refuse to sign on to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> negotiation plan that has <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, and the Israeli government is dubious about an Egyptian variation that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> thinks might attract other Arabs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for a foreign policy address last Monday to the special session of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, held a meeting with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on the side. Then <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met Wednesday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, and in a three-way session on Thursday with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. `` I believe there may be some potential for progress,'' he told reporters afterward. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not have to sell the Egyptian approach to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. It would have been like preaching to the choir. The head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> already had accepted some of the most controversial Egyptian features. These include a place at the bargaining table for Palestinians who were deported during the 22-month rebellion on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and a prior commitment by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish most or possibly all of the land <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> lost in the 1967 Six-Day War. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, on the other hand, had no chance of persuading <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who is from the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition headed by <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, that the Egyptian plan is `` a potential way'' of getting to negotiations. In fact, a key aide to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, obviously sensitive to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' opposition, insisted diplomatically that the 10 points advanced by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> were neither a plan nor a proposal. He called it a `` vehicle'' for negotiations and reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan. The idea is not to antagonize <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has described the <LOCATION> Israeli-Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiations <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is trying to set up in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> as `` surrender talks.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for participation only by Palestinians who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. And he will not commit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to giving up land for peace. The negotiations would produce limited self-rule for the Palestinians. After five years, a new round of talks would explore a lasting settlement. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, has met with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and has accepted the Egyptian president's formula, which also would freeze further Jewish settlements in the territories. But <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10 points have split the Israeli government. `` In a government of 24 ministers you are bound to find differences of opinion,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said Wednesday after seeing <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Logically, that is true. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a democracy and there is a constant clash of conflicting points of view. But <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> understated the problem. It is reaching crisis proportions because it concerns how much <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should concede in risky negotiations. The Israeli `` inner-Cabinet'' _ the key ministers _ will meet next Wednesday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to debate <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal. This could produce a compromise between the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> formulas. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s hope evidently is that the Israelis would be willing to go the table with their plan and face Palestinians ready to negotiate on the basis of the <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> formula. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is trying to muddle through, listening and hoping for some opening to the bargaining table. Others have harbored the same hope and failed.

 An investigating panel of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professors </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> violated the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s academic freedom when it barred him from teaching theology at the school because of his views on sexual issues. The panel's report, published in the association journal <LOCATION> Academe </LOCATION>, says the university also failed to protect its own freedom and that of its faculty in its actions against <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, whose liberal views on abortion, homosexuality and other issues had been criticized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The report said, `` The administration and the board of trustees for all practical purposes deprived him -LRB- <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> -RRB- of his tenure without due process and without adequate cause'' after the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> declared him `` unsuitable'' to teach Catholic theology. `` The administration, and particularly the board of trustees, failed in the case of Professor <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> to exercise their responsibility to protect the university's autonomy and academic freedom of the faculty,'' the report of the three-member committee concluded. In late 1986, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ruled that <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, who had taught at the school for 21 years, was `` not eligible nor suitable to teach Catholic theology.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was suspended in January 1987, though he was never fired. He sued the university, but a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> judge in February declined to order his reinstatement as a teacher of theology at the school. He currently teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. The university response, which was published with the report, said that school officials acted properly and that the <ORGANIZATION> AAUP </ORGANIZATION> committee `` disregards the distinct character of Catholic theology and the unique relationship of the university'' to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> cherishes academic freedom, but academic freedom is not an absolute,'' the school's reply said. `` Academic freedom may be limited by the religious aims of the institution, as the committee notes, and by the peculiar norms of the discipline `` The physicist is not free to ignore the data of the laboratory. A <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theologian is not free to disregard church teachings, which constitute indispensable data for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theology.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AAUP </ORGANIZATION> committee's report does not constitute a formal censure of the university, according to association officials. Such an action could only come from the full <ORGANIZATION> AAUP </ORGANIZATION> convention in June. `` This is by no means cut and dried,'' said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON>, association general secretary. `` There has been keen interest in this report.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, who taught moral theology at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, has dissented from church leaders on a range of sexual issues, expressing the views that contraception and sterilization are not `` intrinsically evil'' and that the church should allow divorce `` in certain circumstances.'' He also has said that under certain conditions homosexual acts `` in the context of a loving relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be objectively and morally acceptable.''

 A Dutch painter who was famous before <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>, forgotten for centuries and finally a favorite in American homes gets his first big exhibit outside the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> at the National Gallery of Art beginning Sunday. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hals </PERSON>' `` Laughing Cavalier'' _ a happy 17th century Dutchman in a huge hat _ looks down from the walls of thousands, possibly millions, of rooms belonging to families who may not know the name of <PERSON> Hals </PERSON>. Nobody knows the name of the cavalier. It is one of the few Hals masterpieces not in the exhibit. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Slive </PERSON>, its co-curator, explained that it belongs to the Wallace Collection in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and can not be loaned. Dozens of other museums, from ones in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, did send some of their paintings. <PERSON> Slive </PERSON> saw the Soviet loan as a sign of the times. The Soviets, who often used to hide their religious paintings, promptly sent portrayals of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>. `` Last time I tried to get pictures from the Soviets for a show in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, they arrived the week the show was closing,'' <PERSON> Slive </PERSON> said. A professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Slive </PERSON> is one of the world's leading authorities on <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> Though the show does not have the `` Laughing Cavalier,'' it does have `` The Merry Drinker,'' which looks a lot like it and is reproduced almost as often. `` It sells more postcards in the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> Rijksmuseum than any painting except <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s ` Night Watch,''' <PERSON> Slive </PERSON> said. `` That's the best sign of popular appeal. <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> was in his 40s when <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s first work began to appear. They lived only a few miles from one another _ Rembrandt in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hals </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> _ but there is no indication that they ever met, and not much record of <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> at all. `` Painters are n't writers,'' <PERSON> Slive </PERSON> said. `` All they ever wrote was, ` Give me more time to finish,' and ` I need money.''' One of the few contemporary accounts of <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> says he drank himself `` to the gills'' every night, but historians are not sure that is so. Both <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> are known for their stately portraits, many of them grouped in the military companies that defended the young Dutch republic. <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> belonged to one. One he painted is known as `` The Meager Company'' because its members lack the big bellies seen in so many others. Among the individual portraits is a rare full-length study of a wealthy and obviously proud <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> merchant, <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heythuysen </PERSON>. A little more is known of him than of <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> _ he wore red satin underwear. `` You ca n't see it in the portrait _ it's in the inventory of his property taken after his death,'' <PERSON> Slive </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Hals </PERSON> himself died in poverty in his 80s. He came from a modest family and his birth date is uncertain, though he is known to have died in 1666. Two of his last great paintings in the exhibit are group portraits of the trustees _ men and women in separate pictures _ who were responsible for a poorhouse. The exhibit, financed by a bank holding company, closes Dec. 31 before going to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Paper: Soviets Dropped A-Bomb Near Troops in 1954 Radiation Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet Union dropped an atomic bomb near its own soldiers 35 years ago to test their ability to fight on ground contaminated by radiation, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper disclosed Friday. Although the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported at the time that an atomic test had been carried out, there was no mention that soldiers were involved, said the daily <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. `` A real atomic bomb was detonated during a Soviet military exercise on Sept. 14, 1954, in order to study the effects of the explosion and test troops' ability to negotiate contaminated terrain,'' it said. `` After the atomic strike, there were not only no landmarks left on the terrain, but the area itself became unrecognizable.'' Red Star said there were no casualties at the time, but it did not address possible long-term health problems caused by radiation. All Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests have been underground since 1963 when the countries signed a treaty banning atomic explosions in the atmosphere. Prior to the treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conducted 100 tests above ground, and scores of soldiers assigned to the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site near <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> later sought compensation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for illnesses they said were caused by the tests. Figures on the number of Soviet tests carried out are not available, and there have been no reports of radiation casualties. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said it carried the article, titled `` The Explosion We Can Now Talk About,'' in response to a reader's query _ a technique often used by officials to open formerly closed subjects to public scrutiny. The newspaper said the test, in the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, was carried out because of the Cold War and at a time when <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were expanding by bringing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into the defense alliance. `` It never occurred to us to question any measure meant to bolster the army's battle-worthiness and the country's defense capability,'' the newspaper said. `` Full-size foxholes and standard-fire trenches, with overhead covers in many places, and deep underground shelters with double doors were built for the forces, equipment and ammunition,'' the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said soldiers were equipped with gas masks, dark glasses and chemical-resistant clothing, and special decontamination centers were established near the blast site. To limit the spread of radiation and fallout, the bomb was dropped from an airplane and detonated at an altitude of only 300 to 500 yards, the newspaper said. `` Those who were in the shelter during the explosion did not see it, but they all felt the bomb exploding,'' it said. `` Some of them said there was a kind of thunder, a deafening sound.'' Observers emerged from the shelter to see `` a huge cloud, covering half the sky, pushed from below by scarlet flames,'' the article said. Although no injuries were reported, the article said one soldier barely escaped blindness and possible death by hurling himself face-down into a foxhole as the bomb exploded. Another, in the open about six miles from ground zero, took cover behind a mound of earth `` and was only slightly frightened,'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. Observers `` saw several tanks, among them heavy tanks, close to the center of the blast. Some of them had melted and others were pushed into the ground. Others had been hurled dozens of meters and some were lying upside down,'' the newspaper said. `` Everything was covered with stones, soil and dead animals.'' The test site was chosen because it was virtually unpopulated, the newspaper reported. Scientists waited for the right wind conditions to prevent fallout from contaminating any villages nearby, it said. After the blast, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said, there was little radiation. Scientists `` noted that <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counters did not react,'' the report said. `` One tank commander thought it was malfunctioning, but the same thing was happening with other <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counters.'' They concluded that because the bomb was dropped from a relatively low altitude, radiation was confined to a small area, the report said.

<TEXT>
 An excommunicated elder of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s hierarchy and some of its scholars are questioning leadership and doctrine in a church whose tenets allow little room for criticism. Calls for a priesthood open to women, appointment of younger leaders and a shedding of the institution's authoritarian image preceded a departing salvo from the first high church official to be excommunicated in 46 years. `` The pride and the arrogance and love of control is getting to the point that they are saying they are greater than <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> charged of his former brethren after his Sept. 1 expulsion from The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> will not be present when the church convenes its 159th Semiannual General Conference on Saturday. But many of the faith's 40000 Navajos will be watching for any response by leaders to questions raised by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Navajo, about the role of Indians in the faith's doctrine Beyond announcing that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, had been excommunicated for `` apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member of the church,'' the governing First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles declined to elaborate, but reaffirmed their love for Indians. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 47, was the only American Indian ever appointed a general authority, a term defining members of the Seventy, the Twelve and the three-member presidency headed by President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 90, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture secretary. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has been on a spiritual retreat for three weeks. He said he wanted to fast and pray in the manner of his medicine-man father in order to sort out his future. Before leaving he turned down a publisher's offer of a $ 150,000 book advance and declined to encourage others to take up his cause. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> characterized members of the Twelve as proud and greedy men who prize power and position over love and charity. He also claimed they are bent on robbing Indians of what his people believe is their special standing in Mormon scripture. The allegation is a serious one for a rapidly expanding church that maintains more than 35,000 full-time missionaries and has had some of its most successful proselyting among Latin American Indians. `` I think the fallout of this may reach south of the border,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, co-editor of Dialogue, a scholarly periodical of Mormon history, belief and literature. While acknowledging the vast majority of Mormons felt <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s ouster was probably justified, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said many wrote expressing concern about the fact and manner of his erasure from membership rolls Mormons on the Navajo Indian Reservation located in parts of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said church leaders sent from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to soothe alarm over the <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> affair had tried to muzzle local leaders and managed only to confuse the doctrinal issues. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s parting broadside recalled themes raised by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscano </PERSON>, a lawyer and Mormon writer, in a paper delivered in August at an annual gathering of Mormon scholars and artists. <PERSON> Toscano </PERSON> blamed the church's leadership, not its critics, for fostering contention. <PERSON> Toscano </PERSON> said his paper was prompted by April sermons by general authorities which, in their warnings about `` alternate voices'' within the church, `` sought to inflict upon us a kind of spiritual lobotomy in order to keep us docile and submissive.'' Mormons are taught that their leaders from founder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to the present are divinely inspired prophets whose pronouncements carry the weight of scripture. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmage </PERSON>, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> scholar, shocked many church members with his suggestion in June that women be ordained to the priesthood.

 One of two adult red wolves died after it was released on a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> island as an experiment to try to revive the endangered species, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. The wolves, a male and a female, were placed last January on <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, part of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seashore </LOCATION>, which is headquartered near this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> city. The female, which gave birth to seven pups May 6, was found dead by park personnel Wednesday, said Gulf Islands Superintendent <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>. The cause of death was unknown; a necropsy is scheduled. The two federal agencies and the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> have been jointly conducting the experiment to determine whether captive-raised wolves could adapt to living on their own and breed in the wild. They hope to relocate offspring from <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to establish a wild population there. The adult male and the pups will remain on the island, which is accessible only by boat. Park personnel use radio tracking equipment to monitor the wolves' movements.

 A federal grand jury indicted five men linked to racist skinhead groups in connection with vandalism at a Jewish temple and attacks on blacks and Hispanics, authorities said today. `` This is our first major frontal assault against skinhead terrorist activities,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant district attorney. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, an acting assistant attorney general heading the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division, announced today that a grand jury in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> handed up the indictment Thursday. The charges against five associates of the Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hammerskins </ORGANIZATION> stem from attacks in the summer and fall of 1988. Two of the defendants are still being sought by federal authorities. Federal authorities believe the Hammerskins are a faction of the skinhead groups that have been identified in racist attacks in several metropolitan areas around the country. The skinhead subculture emerged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the 1960s. Segments of the movement took on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> overtones in 1985 and since have been supported by and associated with the white supremacist <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and White Aryan Resistance. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Attorney General -LRB- <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> have made it clear that prosecutions of this type rank right up there with the war on drugs,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. He said the three-count indictment names <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who was arrested in the vandalism on Temple <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a state judge after admitting he sprayed swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans at the center. He also was fined $ 5,000. Tarrant and <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> also are in custody. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, an attorney with the civil rights division, said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> remained at large. He said at least some of the defendants were from the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area but declined to give hometowns or ages of the others. The indictment alleged two separate but related conspiracies to commit acts of violence, including the vandalism at the Jewish temple and community center in October 1988, and violence against blacks and <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> at <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> in August 1988. If convicted, all five face 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine in the two conspiracies, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and Wood each face an additional count of using a firearm in a violent crime. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said the park attacks occurred because the skinhead group believed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> was a symbol of white supremacy that should not have been frequented by non-whites. He said the defendants attacked blacks and Hispanics and tried to chase them out of the park.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today brushed aside former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s bid to persuade the court to restore him to office and to order the state to pay him more than $ 600,000. The court said it had no power to overrule the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and that even if it did, the violations of which <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted did fall in the category of impeachable offenses. The controversial first-term Republican was removed from office April 4, 1988, when the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him on civil impeachment charges he misused money in a state protocol fund and tried to obstruct an investigation. `` Even if this Court had jurisdiction to intervene and prevent impeachment ... there is almost unanimous agreement that offenses are impeachable when they ` involve serious abuse of official power,''' the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> wrote in an unsigned, 5-0 opinion. `` This court has no power to substitute its view on these questions for that of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nor to dictate to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, either before or after the impeachment trial, the rules and methods to be followed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in reaching its conclusions.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was out of his office and unavailable for comment, an aide said. His attorney scheduled an afternoon news conference and declined to comment in advance of it. During a hearing Sept. 21, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer told the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the protocol fund statute under which <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted was drafted unconstitutionally and that senators were allowed to vote on the charges without having heard all the evidence or agreeing on what the exact charges were. The state attorney general's office, urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> not to intervene, argued that senators voted to oust <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> because of his general course of conduct and not because of any particular statute. Also, a lawyer for the officer said, impeachment trials are political in nature and courts have no right to interfere as long as lawmakers follow the few rules for impeachment set forth in the Arizona Constitution.

Furthermore, he told reporters, some of the debates at the two-day conference in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, reflected `` a total absence of any knowledge'' about schools. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Air Force One to visit areas stricken by Hurricane Hugo, was asked by reporters if the president planned to speak to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> about the remarks. `` I doubt it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Gov. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> spoke to him and I think <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s probably gotten the message.''

<HEAD>High-Tech Nylon Nets Snare Idaho Trout During Its Pacific Migration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Each night, Asian fishing trawlers play out thousands of miles of invisible monofilament nylon nets in the <LOCATION> mid-Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to snare seafood for Oriental markets. But the haul made by illegal `` drift-netters,'' modern-day ecological pirates, could dictate the future of a species close to the hearts of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> anglers _ steelhead trout. The relationship between the oceanic trawlers and the fish associated with <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s effervescent mountain streams is as tangled as the nets unraveled nightly. The environmental group Earthtrust from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> documented about 1,500 drift-net boats operating in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in 1988. Of those, 30 to 60 boats were illegally taking fish, and even the legal boats destroy a variety of species caught in their nets, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who directs drift-net enforcement efforts for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` Those pirate ships cover up their names and markings,'' he said. `` They're crooks; they're going out and stealing fish.'' The technology that put <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> at the forefront of many international markets is evident in the drift nets. They hang from floats and catch anything down to about 40 feet. The nets are strong as wire and nearly transparent. They are rolled out in the evening and stretch up to 60 miles per craft. In the morning, they are hauled in and workers pick off the fish. The body count also includes thousands of drowned porpoises, sea birds, seals and even dead whales, strangled by a plastic noose. Earthtrust estimates that fish and mammals face a `` curtain of death'' about 30,000 miles long. Even if the snares are cut and set adrift, they continue to pull in a catch as `` ghost nets,'' and steelhead, the migratory trout from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s mountain streams, are directly in the drift nets' path. The mid-Pacific features a warm flow of water that attracts fishing boats seeking red squid and other target species. But steelhead and salmon also are found in pockets of cold water, and catching them is illegal, said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, anadromous fish coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. Anadromous refers to fish that go from salt water to fresh water to spawn, such as salmon, shad and steelhead. `` The warm-water species run smack dab into the cold-water species,'' he said. `` It's hard to set regulations for the pockets of cold water that are upwelling.'' <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s chinook salmon usually follow the coast to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, while steelhead migrate to the ocean south of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The illegal drift-net boats may stray 400 miles north of the international boundaries to catch salmon in that area. The number of fall steelhead returning to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> is up somewhat from last year because cooler weather has caused them to swim upriver faster. But the population of fish now plying <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> waters is far smaller than in the past, officials say. The illegal catches of migratory <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian fish came to light in 1986-1987 during a crackdown by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' agency on `` fish laundering'' on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Tons of salmon were being transferred from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, then given fraudulent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documentation so they could be legally shipped to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which has outlawed Taiwanese imports of high-seas salmon. In one breakthrough, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> covertly arranged to buy 500 metric tons of salmon from a Taiwanese merchant, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. As 140 tons were being transferred from two Taiwanese fishing boats to a hired refrigerator ship south of the <LOCATION> Aleutians </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships appeared on the horizon. One boat was chased all the way to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Of the 140 metric tons of fish found, 1.4 tons were steelhead, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The merchant was arrested at a bank when he tried to deposit his take. <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said wrangling between <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> states and Canadian provinces over the rights to migratory fish has dissolved in the face of a greater threat from the drift nets. Representatives of the two nations met recently in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and agreed to study the problem. A specific analysis of the drift-netters' effect on salmon and steelhead will be available by late winter, <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said. `` We know <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> steelhead are involved in it,'' he said. `` But we do n't know how much.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has concluded three agreements with the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> nations to allow observers on the drift-net boats, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Some already are in place on Japanese craft. But arranging observers is difficult. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must gain the permission of the captain or country of origin, and the pirate ships do n't want to be spotted, let alone carry an observer, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The technology that produced the drift nets has outstripped the monitoring efforts to stop them, <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said. Conservationists are worried that robbing the seas of some species could cause a wholesale collapse of the entire biological chain. Said <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>: `` The ocean, like everything else, has its limits.''

 Archbishop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, began his first official visit to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Friday by embracing Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and urging greater unity with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> was following in the footsteps of three previous Anglican leaders who traveled to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> since 1960 as part of an effort to reunite the churches that split in the 16th century over the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s refusal to give King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> a divorce. `` I'm full of hope that we shall be able to build on the understanding and unity which we already enjoy between the Anglican and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> told reporters on arrival at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s Leonardo da Vinci airport He added, however, that he expected `` straightforward and frank conversations'' about the relationship between the two churches. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>, met privately with the Polish-born <PERSON> pope </PERSON> for 50 minutes Friday evening. The meeting had been billed by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials as a simple exchange of greetings, but it appeared to last longer than expected. The religious leaders embraced at the beginning and end of their talks, according to a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman, the Rev. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Ercole </PERSON>. After the encounter in the pope's library, the Anglican leader was the guest of honor at a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> reception. In a brief speech, he praised the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council for emphasizing respect for other faiths and urging religious unity. The Anglican and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches have made major strides in recent years on reconciling their teachings on such matters as salvation and the leadership of the pope. Anglican leaders say they think the churches will unite in the 21st century. However, a major disagreement has developed over the ordination of women. The Anglican church allows members such as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians to ordain women priests. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who strongly supports the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s policy on an all-male priesthood, has declared that ordaining women seems to `` effectively block the path to the mutual recognition of ministries.'' Both sides said <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s four-day trip would probably not yield dramatic developments but would simply continue the series of contacts between the churches. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promoting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> noted in a statement that <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> was paying a return visit for the pope's historic 1982 trip to <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, mother church of the 27-province Anglican Communion. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> have met previously in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s visit was his first to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> as leader of the Anglican church, the world's largest group of Christians after the estimated 850 million Roman Catholics The archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>'s visit began amid a mild controversy caused by <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s declaration to an Italian journalist that the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> might recognize papal authority in a united church. The view had already been stated by a <ORGANIZATION> Vatican-Anglican </ORGANIZATION> commission that has been discussing unification for many years, but it drew the fire of Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> evangelicals who oppose unity with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Govt Announces Cease-Fire Extension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced Friday it will extend its unilateral cease-fire with Sinhalese militants by three days in a bid to curb ethnic violence that has claimed at least 16,000 lives in six years. A three-day cease-fire that started Wednesday was scheduled to expire at 6 a.m. Saturday, but President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> met with opposition leaders and announced it would continue. A government communique said Friday that 14 people had been killed in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the Sinhalese heartland, since the cease-fire began. The victims were government supporters or security personnel. The communique also said at least 14 government offices, 10 state-owned buses, seven post offices and a factory had been set on fire during the same period. The Sinhalese-dominated government ordered the three-day cease-fire, saying it hoped Sinhalese radicals would end their violence and open peace talks. Sinhalese militants have not responded to the call. Meanwhile, Indian peacekeeping forces clashed with Tamil guerrillas in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, breaking a 10-day-old cease-fire and killing five militants, military officials said. The officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the clash between Indian soldiers and Tamil guerrillas took place Thursday in the northeastern town of <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION>, 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Five rebels were killed and five others were wounded, they said. Two Indian soldiers also were hurt in the first major attack since the peacekeeping forces called an indefinite cease-fire Sept. 20. Military officials said the largest and most militant Tamil group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, provoked the clash. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> deployed an estimated 47,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in July 1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil rebellion. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> government has said the remaining 42,000 troops will be gone by Dec. 31. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which mediated the peace accord, became involved in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic problems because 60 million Tamils living in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are sympathetic to the rebel cause. The accord offered the Tamils limited autonomy if they would give up their demand for an independent homeland in the northeast and surrender their weapons. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> rejected the accord and turned their guns on Indian soldiers. The presence of Indian troops also triggered a violent backlash by Sinhalese radicals, who claimed the government offered too many concessions to the Tamils and compromised the country's sovereignty by inviting foreign troops to Sri Lankan soil. Ramils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people They contend they are denied jobs and education by the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed since the Tamil insurgency started in 1983. Another 5,000 people have died since Sinhalese radicals launched their anti-government campaign two years ago.

 A fireman atop a fire truck that speed across the path of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train into a collision that killed two and injured 150 said Friday the last thing he remembers is mowing his lawn. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, 21, thinks he was riding in the jump seat directly behind the driver of the <ORGANIZATION> Catlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> truck when it crossed the tracks. Officials have declined to speculate on the cause of the collision Thursday evening about 50 miles from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` I do n't remember anything,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said by telephone Friday from his bed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. `` The last thing I remember I was mowing the grass ..., then I was here.'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a state police spokeswoman, said the firefighters were responding to a report of a blaze near a home on the other side of the tracks. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials said the Crescent, en route from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, sounded its horn when it approached the crossing of the private drive alongside <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> 28. There was no crossing bar and no warning light at the crossing. Ms. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said the fire truck had its air horn, siren and flashing red lights on at the time of the collision. Two of the five firefighters on the truck were killed; at least 150 of the train's 379 passengers were injured. Most of the injuries to train passengers were minor. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who joined the fire department about four months ago, was in fair condition. `` I feel all right ... just pretty sore,'' he said. <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, another firefighter, said he felt the truck cross the track `` and the next thing I know, I woke up and I was in the hospital.'' <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> was treated at a hospital and released. The third survivor on the truck, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, was in serious condition at <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Firefighters <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, both of <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON>, died at the scene. `` We're talking to witnesses, to the crew, to see why it happened,'' said <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The federal investigation is limited, Ms. <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON> said, because the accident involved a highway crossing. State police are conducting a full investigation. `` I was looking outside a window and I saw a fire engine. Then a split second later, I saw flames shoot past my window,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The collision destroyed the truck, scattering bits of the vehicle along the roadside. `` I was flipping over and over,'' said <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mungo </PERSON>, a conductor on the 16-car train. `` I heard a big bang. It was like rocks flying, a big loud crunching sound and the train just stopped. ... My worst nightmare.'' Railroad crews worked through the night to clear the tracks. Ms. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said about 470 yards of track were destroyed. Heavy equipment, including cranes and bulldozers, were being used to move the 12 cars and two locomotives that derailed after the accident, said <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leatherwood </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Lengthy schedule delays were not expected, he said. Delays were running about two hours Friday as traffic was rerouted.

 The Communist Party leader, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, condemned the West's `` rotten lifestyles'' and predicted the triumph of socialism over capitalism as he opened celebrations Friday marking 40 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. `` We are full of confidence in our socialist cause and are sure of a bright Communist future for mankind,'' he said in his first major speech since taking office in June after a power struggle triggered by pro-democracy protests. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s 80-minute speech televised live from the Great Hall of the People began a weekend of activities that will climax with dances and fireworks on Sunday, National Day. But he gave short shrift to celebrating the achievements made since <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s Oct. 1, 1949, proclamation of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Instead, he focused grimly on the themes that have preoccupied the leadership in the past few months: stamping out Western liberal influences and maintaining vigilance against anti-socialist ideas. `` Only socialism can save <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said in an unrelentingly hard-line speech filled with old-fashioned ideological rhetoric that had gone out of style in recent years. `` We can borrow some of the methods used by capitalist countries, but we can not copy -LRB- them -RRB-. We must clearly distinguish between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy ... Extremist democracy and anarchism.'' The leaders who used the army to crush the student-led spring democracy movement have insisted the students' demands for a more responsive, accountable government amounted to `` extremist democracy.'' Relatively liberal officials, such as then-party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who favored compromising with the students, were ousted in the power struggle. Martial law imposed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> during the May protests remains in effect, and already tight security has been tightened further for the holiday. Soldiers with automatic rifles guard <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square, the center of the student protests where the main weekend festivities are to be held The army issued a new martial law order last week warning against any attempts to sabotage the celebrations, but the government has not said if any threats have been delivered. It was the capital's first National Day under martial law, and the red banners, bunting and flowers in the center of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> did little to stir up enthusiasm. `` National Day? Bah,'' one shopkeeper said when asked how he planned to spend the holiday Sunday. `` Some people are anxious because there are soldiers around and they do n't know what they can say and where they can go. So they decided this year, forget it, they do n't care about National Day,'' one Chinese woman said. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s speech, attended by more than 10,000 invited party and government leaders, model workers and soldiers, was not publicized in advance, possibly as a security measure. The audience applauded 14 times, cued each time when <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> raised his voice in a flourish and then paused. But the 62-year-old party leader rarely looked up. He never paused for a drink and his voice soon showed the strain, nearly cracking when he closed with a call for `` the greater victories of socialism.'' The top party and government leaders sat behind <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> on a stage at the front of the hall, decorated with a huge national emblem and the dates 1949-1989. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> praised as the party's `` mainstay,'' did not attend <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85 and reportedly in ill health, skips most public government and party functions, although he has made several public appearances in the past few weeks. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said the party triumphed over anti-socialist forces in the student-led mass protests, but urged, `` We must carry the struggle through to the end ... Isolate and attack the handful of hostile elements, make a thorough investigation into all counterrevolutionary scheming, remove hidden perils and draw profound lessons.'' He praised the army for its role in ending the protests, saying, `` Without the people's army the people would have nothing.'' The army killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people when it rolled into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June with tanks and automatic weapons to retake Tiananmen Square from the protesters. `` The newborn socialist system has experienced twists and turns in the course of its development,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> declared. `` However, history has proven the socialist system has great vigor and vitality. The replacement of capitalism with socialism is the great historical trend.'' He accused `` international reactionary forces'' of seeking to subvert the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government by `` fostering blind worship of the West and spreading Western, capitalist political and economic styles and ... Rotten thinking and lifestyles.'' The class struggle continues, he warned. `` Every party member, especially the leaders, must maintain a high degree of vigilance.''

 Federal authorities said they made the biggest seizure of cocaine on record at a warehouse today, finding at least 20 tons of the drug valued `` conservatively'' at $ 2 billion. About $ 10 million in cash also was seized, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He said at least 20 tons was found, and authorities thought they might locate even more. `` This seizure should put to rest any further speculation -LRB- as to whether -RRB- <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is in fact the major pathway for cocaine entering the country and has in fact become a major distribution center in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said it was by far the biggest cocaine seizure in history. The domestic record until now is 8,700 pounds, a little more than 4 \ tons, seized in hollowed-out picnic furniture in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in November 1987 In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, there is a 12-ton seizure on record. The cocaine was seized at a warehouse in a light industrial area of <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>, a uiet, mostly residential section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, about 25 miles from downtown. The warehouse is on a tree-lined street near the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> foothills. Across the street are offices for the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; next door is a heart pacemaker manufacturer and a hydraulic pump supplier. The warehouse is two miles from Interstate 5, the main north-south thoroughfare in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> special agent in charge for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said at a news conference today that the street value of the haul could be as high as 10 times the wholesale price of $ 2 billion. `` We are trying to send a message to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cartels that were are not going to allow them to take over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON> said. Three men, whose names were not immediately released, were arrested for investigation of conspiring to distribute cocaine, <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said. `` They claimed to be Mexican, but their accents were South American,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> had been investigating and conducting `` intense surveillance'' for a year before moving in about midnight. `` It's about $ 2 billion in cocaine, and that's a very conservative estimate,'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said. `` Twenty tons _ nothing like that has ever been done before.'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON>'s $ 2 billion estimate was based on a wholesale price of $ 100 a gram for pure cocaine. However, based on <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police techniques to calculate cocaine street value _ $ 170,250 per pound _ the value of the drug would be nearly $ 7 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office estimate that more than half the cocaine distributed in the country now floods in through <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Colombian drug groups are bringing it across the border from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> street gangs are distributing it in more than 40 cities across the country, they have said. Cash seizures from the drug trade totaled more than $ 100 million last year in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, topping <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the first time. The city's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> surplus _ one way of measuring illegal money laundering _ has jumped by more than 2,000 percent in five years, to $ 3.8 billion last year. `` The Colombian cocaine cartels have marched into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and have organized the state with a thoroughness the Mafia could only have dreamed of,'' state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said in a speech last month.

Inventories in the 10 top pork states were reported at 45.8 million head, up 2 percent from a year ago. Hog producers nationally expect to have 2.9 million sows farrow this fall, down 1 percent from farrowings during September, October and November last year. Farrowing intentions for December, January and February were estimated at 2.68 million head, virtually unchanged from a year earlier. The following list shows the Sept. 1 inventory in the 10 major states, which account for 78 per cent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total.

<HEAD>US Cuts Off Funds For Contras' U.S. Operations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is cutting off funds for U.S.-based offices of the Nicaraguan Contras as part of a continuing effort to encourage the rebel political leaders to relocate to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday. One official, asking not to be identified, said the move mostly affects the Contra office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where there are `` not many more than 10'' U.S.-taxpayer financed staff workers. That figure is down considerably from several years ago when rebel political operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government backing. But with a political process under way inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and political leaders developing from within the ranks of the Contra fighters, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been encouraging the U.S.-based rebel leadership to return to the region. The administration's policy has drawn criticism from some Contra leaders that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is trying to undermine the rebel's traditional political leadership. A resistance official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the decision effectively dooms the Contras' chances of political survival. `` For me, this is the end of any hope to achieve democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said the resistance official, who asked not to be identified. `` They're leaving the troops without a voice.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that the fund cutoff was not controversial, said Friday, `` We understand the resistance is moving its political offices to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> so as to better represent the combatants.'' It added that the resistance commanders will make arrangements to have the duties carried out at the Contra offices performed by others. Officials declined to say how much money went into the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> operation but they added that funding will be spent in the future on offices the rebels have set up in several Central American countries. Some rebel political leaders returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> several months ago to take part in the process leading up to the February 25 national elections. One of the holdouts has been the Miami-based veteran rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, who has said that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is embarked on a course that not only will strip <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of all hope for a democratic outcome but also will eventually damage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security interests.

<HEAD>Oil Cleanup in Virgin Islands to Take 1 Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It will take at least a month to clean up 84,000 gallons of oil that spilled along three miles of beach in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> after Hurricane Hugo damaged a storage tank, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, said 375,000 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil leaked from a tank at a plant of the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>. Most of the oil was contained by earthen trenches and oil booms, but 84,000 gallons flowed into the harbor before the leak was stopped early Thursday, <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> struck the island about 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Sept. 17. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> equipment was being used to remove oily sand from the beach. <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> said eight-tenths of a mile of beach had been cleaned by Friday, but that it would take a month to clean the remaining two and a quarter miles. The spokesman said no oil-covered birds or marine life had been seen and that `` the impact on the environment is not much to speak of.'' About 200 workers have been contracted for the cleanup, he said. In Lime Tree Bay in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, workers continued recovering 40,000 gallons of heavy oil that spilled from eight damaged storage tanks at a giant <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> refinery. <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> said 420,000 gallons of oil leaked from refinery tanks damaged by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, but most of it stayed in containment areas on the facility. The rest was confined in a small area next to the plant and posed no environmental threat, the spokesman said. He said it would take about a week to clean up that oil.

<TEXT>
 Students in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> have been arrested for selling post cards that carry a photograph of one of the country's leading advocates of democracy, a self-exiled Burmese student said Friday. The photographer who took the picture of <ORGANIZATION> Aung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kyi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that three students have been jailed for distributing the post cards. <PERSON> Thu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rei </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> student leader who fled <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> earlier this month, said the post cards were being sold in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> by students belonging to Mrs. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s National League for Democracy -LRB- NLD -RRB-. He said the cards were being sold for prices ranging from 62 cents to $ 1 with proceeds going to the <ORGANIZATION> NLD </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s largest political group opposing the military junta that seized power a year ago. A photograph of Mrs. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> appeared on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s Aug. 14 Asian edition It was taken by <PERSON> Sandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON>, an Italian photographer. <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> told journalists in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> Wednesday that reports from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> said three students had been arrested for distributing the post cards bearing reproductions of his photo and each was sentenced to three years in prison. The junta, which suppressed pro-democracy movements in a crackdown that claimed hundreds of lives, rules by martial law decrees and has set up military tribunals to try people accused of violating its edicts. <PERSON> Thu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rei </PERSON>, one of thousands of students who have fled to the Thai-Burmese border, said a poem in Burmese on the back of the post cards says that Mrs. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is crying for all of the people arrested by the government. The photograph depicts a tearful leader. Mrs. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, 44, was placed under house arrest July 20 following renewed anti-government demonstrations. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say several thousand people have been arrested since July. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said recently it had reports of widespread torture of the detainees. Mrs. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, married to a British scholar and the daughter of the late national hero <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, has lived outside <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> most of her adult life but returned last year to be with her ailing mother. She joined in the protests against military rule and emerged as a leader of the democratic movement.

<TEXT>
 The federal presidency asked for a halt Friday to regional anti-Slovenian protests, saying <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s integrity was not jeopardized by local constitutional changes, includyvg the right to sesede. The concilia -RCB- Oy statement came a day after rallies in the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> protested constitutional amendments adopted on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leadership favors greater central control over the six republics in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> to make the federation more efficient. `` The presidency stresses its determination to implement the federal constitution in the whole territory of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> ... and that the current problems -LRB- <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s amendments -RRB- will be solved by legal means,'' said the statement carried by the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` The country's institutions are protecting the functioning of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s constitutional and political system and there is no need for protests of citizens and public manifestations.'' The presidency said it was up to the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> to rule on the constitutionality of the Slovenian amendments. <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>'s representative in the collective 8-member presidency, was quoted as ruling out a military option to resolve the dispute. `` Nobody has the right to raise suspicions that martial law may be introduced in this country except in case of grave hardship, broad civil unrest or an armed uprising,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> told a meeting in <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> on Thursday. The Slovenian daily <ORGANIZATION> Dnevnik </ORGANIZATION> said Friday, `` The so-called controversial amendments ... shall bring nothing tangibly new... They represent solely a defensive mechanism from threats and pressures, and a legitimate right of every nation to safeguard its dignity and integrity.'' Slovenian authorities say the small northern republic has no intention to secede and that the amendments merely provide `` an added sense of security'' for the 2 million Slovenes, who make up about 8 percent of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s population. The Slovenian parliament meanwhile proclaimed Oct. 3 the day of Slovenian statehood. A Slovenian liberation organization was formed under Italian occupation on Oct. 3, 1941. Parliament also decided that Dec. 25 will be an official holiday in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which contains many Roman Catholics.

 A filmmaker said Friday he may never show his controversial documentary `` Titicut Follies,'' which depicts brutality in a mental hospital, despite a judge's ruling allowing it to be shown. After a 22-year ban on public viewing of `` Titicut Follies,'' which shows atrocities at <ORGANIZATION> Bridgewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> Superior Judge <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> ruled Thursday the film could be shown if the inmates' faces were blurred. But filmmaker <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, 59, said Friday that will never happen. `` Technically, there's no way the faces could be blurred,'' he said in an interview at Zipporah Films. `` But even if it were possible, I would n't do it. It would n't be a film. It would look terrible.'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said he plans to appeal the judge's decision and said he blames politics for the controversy originally surrounding the film, showing conditions at the state hospital that houses prisoners deemed criminally insane. `` I was disappointed,'' he said. `` I thought after 22 years, why ca n't people be allowed to see a film about a prison that's been poorly run. It seems to me taxpayers should see the kind of institution their state is running.'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said that after the film was first made, state officials such as then-Lt. Gov <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> `` chickened out'' and did n't support the public's right to see it. `` All of sudden they became concerned about the inmates right to privacy, which was at odds with any concern over the conditions the inmates lived in at <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>. `` The state used the issue of the individual's right to privacy to cover up the snakepit that <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION> was.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment. The 85-minute, black and white film shows often horrifying conditions at the hospital, originally built in 1852. Some scenes depict nude men in bare cells being mocked by sadistic guards. At least one inmate shown in the film was kept naked in a cell for 17 years. One man is shown being force fed as he lies on a table and a liquid is poured down a rubber hose shoved into his nose. The film has no narrator. It was ordered withheld from the public six weeks after its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut on grounds it violated the privacy of the 62 inmates featured. But in recent years, state officials have backed <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s right to show the film. Some said they would welcome the chance to let the public know that conditions have changed at <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>. Unfortunately, said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, the judge still believes the inmates should be protected. Though the film can not be shown in public forums, it has been shown to `` hundreds of thousands'' of people over the years, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said. College instructors can order a print of the film for $ 150, as long as they sign affidavits that the people who are viewing the film are within the range of those allowed to see it in the original court order. In that decision, the only people allowed to see the film were doctors, lawyers, legislators, people interested in custodial care and students in related fields _ but not the general public. Since `` Titicut Follies,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> has shot 24 films in 14 different states. They include 1968's `` High School,'' a film about a large urban high school, `` Juvenile Court,'' made in 1973, `` Model,'' made in 1980, about the modeling industry, and `` Missile,'' made in 1987 about the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officers who control the buttons on Minutemen missiles.

 A federal judge said Friday that Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is not entitled to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s diaries for his upcoming criminal trial. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> filed a request earlier this week for the diaries and a wide array of other material, prompting objections from the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. Associate independent counsel <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> complained that the request was far too broad and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> agreed, telling <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, that `` you have asked for everything under the kitchen sink.'' `` I tell you he is not getting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> diaries,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s request. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> did not press the issue of the diaries, but said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is entitled to material showing a number of covert activities he was engaged in on behalf of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. One of 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is that he conspired to pay illegal gratuities to former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The gratuities were to encourage <PERSON> North </PERSON> to continue in his <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> post so that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> would continue to receive business in connection with secretly resupplying the Nicaraguan Contras and the administration's <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms initiative. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he is entitled to show the extent of the relationship between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and to try to prove that if gratuities were paid, the reason had nothing to do with the Contras or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> promised to try to narrow his request for documents by next Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with compromise; edits to tighten.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators agreed Friday to bar federal funding for art deemed to be obscene and lacking in significant literary or artistic merit. The provision represents a weakening of a Senate-passed measure backed by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that called for banning federal aid for art that is `` obscene or indecent'' or that `` denigrates'' a religion, race, ethnic background, age group or handicap. The compromise ended the conferees' work, clearing a major roadblock in the way of agreement on an $ 11 billion measure to fund interior and cultural programs for the new fiscal year that begins Monday. It would deny support to certain art that depicts sexual acts, sadomasochism, homoeroticism or the sexual exploitation of children. The conferees, borrowing from the benchmark 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on obscenity, agreed that the works must lack significant literary, artistic, political or scientific merit to be denied funding. The decision on whether a work is obscene would be made by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The restrictions would last a year, and negotiators provided $ 250,000 for a commission to study how government arts grants are awarded. `` I do n't know if it's a victory for anybody,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., chief Democratic negotiator `` I'm not fully pleased with it, but it's a way of resolving differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, R-Ida. The controversy was sparked when conservatives objected to photographs shown at two exhibitions sponsored by the NEA. One exhibited <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> photographs depicting children in erotic poses and homosexual and sadomasochistic themes, and another displayed an <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine. The Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, showed the <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> work, and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> showed the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> photographs. It had been proposed that both organizations be banned for five years, but negotiators agreed that they instead would be put on probation for a year and that the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> would have to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> any grants to them. Earlier Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 65-31 urging the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to adopt legislation barring federal assistance for `` obscene materials'' depicting some sexual themes. `` We do know in our hearts that there are community values that we all share and we must uphold as policymakers and Americans,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga. On July 26, with few members in the chamber, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted the original version of the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions on a voice vote But shortly before midnight Thursday, lawmakers refused on a 62-35 vote to reaffirm the July action. Thursday's vote clearly worried many legislators, who wondered openly about how it might be used by future election campaign opponents. `` What 30-second ad might come out of this,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said was a lively topic of conversation among his colleagues The answer, he said, was a commercial stating, `` Senator so-and-so voted for pornography.'' Fifty Democrats and 15 Republicans voted for the weaker restrictions, while 28 Republicans and three Democrats opposed them. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation cutting the endowment's $ 1.7 billion budget by $ 45,000, but it contained no new standards for artwork that can receive federal support. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, a trial lawyer from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, 47, confirmed on a voice vote, was critical of the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment when he appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this week. `` I think that the problem ... of intrusion and the difficulty in making unfettered artistic judgments would be most difficult to handle under the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under a price subsidy program for the first time in almost six months, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. F. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said five private exporting companies made the deals for a total of 270,000 metric tons under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the program last Feb. 27. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> used about 1.1 million tons of the new authorization and then switched to straight commercial deals for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. After the deals reported Friday, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have 640,000 tons remaining to be used under the current authorization. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The latest sales would be about 9.9 million bushels. At current prices estimated by the department at $ 3.68 per bushel, the wheat would have a farm value of around $ 36 million. Under the Export Enhancement Program, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said the latest subsidies averaged $ 10.95 per ton, or about 30 cents per bushel. The subsidized sales were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 70,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 90,000; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 30,000; <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Toepfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, 30,000. With the latest sales, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought about 4 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began on June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought more than 8 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, all of it subsidized.

<HEAD>1990 Feed Grain Set-Aside Requirements Will Mirror This Year's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers who produce corn and other feed grains in 1990 will have the same acreage set-aside requirements as they had this year, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced Friday. The acreage reduction program, or ARP, for corn, sorghum and barley will carry an idling requirement of 10 percent of the farmer's base acreage, and oats 5 percent. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said feed grain stockpiles `` should be adequate to maintain our competitive position in the world market, while providing adequate supplies at reasonable prices to our domestic feed grain consumers.'' But he said the oats ARP was set at a different rate than corn and barley in 1988 and 1989 and that this is being done again for 1990 to make oats planting more competitive with the other crops. The corn target price for 1990 was announced at $ 2.75 per bushel, down from $ 2.84 this year; sorghum was set at $ 2.61 per bushel, compared with $ 2.70; barley, $ 2.36 per bushel, compared with $ 2.43; and oats, $ 1.45 against $ 1.50. Under the program, when market prices fall below the targets farmers can get `` deficiency'' payments to make up the difference between market levels and price support loan rates, whichever are higher. Loan rates, or the amount farmers can borrow from the goverment using their crops as collateral, were also announced. Corn loans were set at $ 1.57 per bushel, down from $ 1.65 for 1989. Other feed grain loans were lowered accordingly. Signup for the 1990 crop programs will be held at county offices of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Jan. 16 through April 13.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats on Friday scheduled a vote next week on long-stalled legislation requiring an investigation into the seven-month-old <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said they would seek consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a three-person commission to study the work stoppage and make recommendations for its solution `` It is long past time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Since March, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans have been blocking debate on House-passed legislation requiring President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board to recommend a way to end the walkout. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to appoint a board and threatened to veto the bill, saying unions and management should solve the dispute themselves. Democrats scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether to force a debate on the bill. They said if successful, they would then substitute union-backed language creating a commission with one member each appointed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. The strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> began March 4, led by machinists but bolstered by pilots unhappy with owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Five days later, the airline filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws. Democrats pulled the bill off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor in April when it appeared that former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> would purchase the carrier. Eastern is continuing its efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court. The airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier one-third its former size. It has been rehiring hundreds of pilots who have crossed picket lines and training new crews. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said Republicans will oppose the legislation, apparently in line with White House requests `` We at one point thought there might be some way to have another investigation, but after consultation with administration leaders we determined that was not in the interests of Eastern or its present or former employees.''

 British and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials on Friday concluded three days of blunt talks about <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> held that sending <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops there after 1997 is an internal matter. Both countries reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement under which <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is to retain its capitalist system for 50 years after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in less than eight years. But at separate news conferences they acknowledged they basically disagree about what caused <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents' confidence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pledges to be shaken It was the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s first meeting since the military crackdown on pro-democracy students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June. A July meeting was canceled. `` It was an unusual, not to say an exceptional meeting,'' said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> delegation chief <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON>, a Foreign Office undersecretary. `` There was some pretty straight talk. Each side set out very clearly it's own view of the situation. Both sides agreed that there is a problem of confidence in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>; we continue to differ about the cause of that situation.'' <PERSON> Ke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaishuo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ambassador leading his delegation, told reporters, `` I have to admit there are some major differences between us on matters of important principle.'' <PERSON> Ke </PERSON> said the right to post troops in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is `` symbolic of the sovereignty of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and is an internal affair of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He said suggestions that restrictions should be placed on how many troops of the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could be sent to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, or on the scope of their authority `` are quite wrong.'' A British official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, reminded the Chinese that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents were sensitive about the prospect of troops after the crackdown on protesters centered in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> `` and urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to pay attention'' to those sensitivities. Many of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s better-educated and wealthier citizens are fleeing the colony, taking their skills and money with them, or are obtaining other passports as a backup in case they want to flee. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also wants <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to agree to more specific conditions under which a state of emergency could be declared in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The present specificiation says only in time of `` turmoil.'' <PERSON> Ke </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> objections to reports of what happened on June 3-4, when troops killed hundreds as they moved to recapture Tiananmen Square from protesting students. He said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities put down a `` counter-revolutionary rebellion.'' `` Because of the one-sided reports, the distorted reports, and also because of some rumors there was some alarm in the community of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' Ke said. The officials will meet again in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Dec. 5-8.

<HEAD>Thousands March in Protest Against Apartheid, Police Suppression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KING WILLIAM'S TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people marched through this city to the police headquarters Friday to protest apartheid and police suppression. The independent South African Press Association estimated 20,000 people joined the procession, led by clergymen, while scores of policemen watched. No violence was reported during the march, which had received official permission from a magistrate. Organizers claimed it was the biggest march since the funeral procession for <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, founder of the black consciousness movement who died in 1977 while in police custody. Also Friday, a man convicted in the murder of a schoolteacher was executed despite an appeal for mercy by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mangena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON>, 36, a black member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was hanged. He was convicted in the 1985 killing of <PERSON> Mellina </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, a black teacher who apparently defied a school boycott called by anti-apartheid militants. Mrs. <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, who was in her 50s, was a victim of a `` necklace'' murder _ killed by having a gasoline-soaked tire placed around her neck and set afire. Dozens of blacks considered collaborators with the white government were killed by the `` necklace'' method from 1984 to 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, called on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to commute the death sentence of <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON> and all other `` political prisoners.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said, `` There can be no circumstances in which a violent murder such as the one in this case ... could be considered a rightful political act.'' There have been 39 executions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year, far fewer than in recent years when more than 100 people were hanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black men, remain on death row. About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this year and are serving prison terms. There have been anti-apartheid marches in cities throughout the country since the Sept. 6 elections. Most have been peaceful, but police used batons and dogs to stop women from marching in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> last Saturday because they did not have permission. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told a police parade in the northern <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hammanskraal </LOCATION> on Friday that police had `` no option but to act to curb illegal demonstrations'' such as the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> march. The marches involve the parliamentary elections that excluded the black majority. Anti-apartheid activists say that 23 people were killed in election-day violence instigated by police. Officials initially denied responsibility for any deaths but police opened an investigation and recently said 19 people were killed, including 10 who died in black-vs. - black factional fighting and nine in incidents where police may have One of the leaders of the defiance campaign, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, was released Friday after being held for 42 days without charge. He was placed under heavy resrictions. <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, an official of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and took sanctuary at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The three left the consulate after the government said they would not be arrested. But police seized <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office on Aug. 18, days before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations declared they would ignore the banning orders. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> signed the release order for <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>.

In <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> official said the airline, which is partially owned by the Dutch government, objected to the limitations <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> had agreed to and would continue discussions with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on its investment in Wings. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who has cited national security concerns and the need to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines' negotiating position for foreign routes as reason for close scrutiny of financial ties with foreign carriers, said Friday's action was not meant to discourage foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He praised <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, who formed <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> to buy all the outstanding stock of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s privately held parent company. The secretary, appearing at a news conference with <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, said the new owners were `` exceptionally qualified to expand <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s operations and improve its quality of service. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> disagreed with the department's conclusion that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 400 million equity interest in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> would put the foreign carrier `` in a position to exercise control over <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' thereby depriving Northwest of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship status `` We do not agree,'' said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, `` that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> is, or has ever been, in a position to exercise any actual control over <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> provided 57 percent of the $ 705 million in equity <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> raised to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> but officially owns just 5 percent of the airline, as most of its interest is in nonvoting stock. Under the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> must cut <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s equity share to 25 percent within six months and eliminate a three-member advisory committee the Dutch airline would have controlled. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to keep its seat on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 12-member board, but the its representative can not participate in some sensitive decisions. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, said the airline joined with <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> in the deal because of the need for `` new strategies'' to increase competition in international aviation. `` <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> were drafted on a conservative basis so as to guarantee that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> would remain an American carrier with American management and with American crews flying American aircraft on American routes,'' the statement said. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has the option of either having <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> withdraw $ 224 million of its investment or increasing total equity in the airline so <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s share is cut to 25 percent. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said he already has had several offers and saw no problem with finding new investors. The agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also requires regular reports on <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s finances, a reflection of department concern for the $ 3.1 million debt the takeover imposed on the carrier.

<TEXT>
 All Cabinet ministers offered their resignations Friday after Prime Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> resigned to run for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It is a customary gesture for the Cabinet members to submit their resignations when the prime minister quits and their actions were not seen as a political move. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is expected to announce his choice for a new prime minister in the next few days. He could make some other Cabinet changes but most of the ministers are expected to be reconfirmed. The 88-year-old <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who also serves as senator and first vice president, resigned Thursday. He had said he would resign before the Oct. 8 deadline to allow him to register as a candidate in next year's elections. He became prime minister on May 15 _ the fourth prime minister in <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s four-year-old government. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s term ends July 28, 1990. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is said to be considering naming Defense Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is suffering its worst economic crisis of the century, with huge budget deficits and annual inflation running at more than 5,000 percent. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s promises of reform and a tough stand in dealing with banks and international agencies over <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s foreign debt won him wide support when he was elected four years ago. But public opinion polls show his popularity rating has dropped to under 15 percent. He is barred by law from seeking re-election in the balloting scheduled for April. Novelist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, presidential candidate of a center-right coalition, is the current front-runner according to most polls.

 Colombian <ORGANIZATION> EADS </ORGANIZATION> with 4 grafPresident <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Friday `` there must be no safe haven'' for drug traffickers and urged all nations to sign a treaty allowing seizure of their bank accounts and property. So far, only the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> has signed the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention on narcotics trafficking, under which signatory nations would also cooperate to seize smugglers' ships and planes in transit. `` We, a community of nations, find ourselves under assault from an internahooters perched on the roof of the Dag Hammarskjold library. `` I am here to lay out the stark realities of this war against drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said in his speech. `` In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the casualties of our struggle have been mounting for some time. A month ago, we suffered the tragic assassination of one of our finest national leaders, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>,'' a popular presidential candidate. `` But our war on drugs has been taking its toll for years,'' he added. `` We have lost 12 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, our attorney general and minister of justice. `` We have lost members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and mayors, scores of journalists, thousands of soldiers and policemen and tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> citizens who were committed to the cause of democracy,'' he said. Drug users create the demand for narcotics, which leads to the killing of people in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and other nations where drugs are grown, processed and shipped, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said. `` No doubt somebody a few blocks from this General Assembly Hall, in one of this city's fashionable neighborhoods, taking cocaine in the civilized calm of his living room, would balk at this description. `` Yet as surely as if he pulled the trigger, he is the slayer of those <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> judges and policemen who have paid with their lives for trying to uphold the law.'' `` Now, there must be no safe haven for the narco-terrorists,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said. `` In this war, the time has come for the community of nations to choose sides.'' All countries must sign the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention on narcotics trafficking, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said. The agreement binds nations to outlaw drugs within their borders, close banking loopholes such as offshore accounts, and makes all drug criminals extraditable. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> pledged to introduce the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for ratification upon his return to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> The president also called on other nations to cooperate in stopping the illegal trade in chemicals for processing cocaine and other drugs. He further called for the industrialized nations to help shut down the traffickers' money-laundering system in banks, investments, real estate and legal businesses. `` If the international banking system cooperates in cracking down, we can put the cartel out of business,'' he said.

 The second national meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kids </ORGANIZATION> ended Friday with a plea to authorities to prevent violence against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s abandoned children and to respect their rights. `` Violence and misery generate other forms of violence, including discrimination, illegal imprisonment, death, assassination, and mistreatment, all of which take place in our daily lives and rob us of our sacred right to be children,'' the final document said. The four-day meeting in this capital city was attended by 750 `` street kids'' selected as representatives from all 26 Brazilian states and was sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund There were observers from 10 Latin American countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. About 45 million Brazilian children live in abject poverty, and of those 12 million are abandoned or are orphans who receive no public assistance, according to the movement's statistics. <PERSON> Benedicto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kids </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` For these kids, survival is a challenge. They work at any job they can find, are used as cheap labor, exploited by adults and little by little are almost inevitably forced to a life of crime.'' According to a study prepared by the Brazilian Institute of Analysis and Statistics, 82 `` street kids'' were slain by death squads during the first six months of 1989. Investigations have shown that many death squads, with off-duty police officers as members, operate in city slums and are paid by store owners to eliminate common criminals. Participants at the meeting here said death-squad members often kill `` street kids'' who are considered to be delinquents. A statement adopted by the meeting's delegates, to be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, declares: `` We want education, to be listened to, dignified salaries for our fathers so we can return to our homes, medical care and information about the prevention of diseases, especially AIDS.'' During the meeting a banner was unfurled that said, `` Quiet Congressman: It's our turn to speak.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday toured a region ravaged by Hurricane Hugo, offering `` a little encouragement'' and a $ 1.1 billion relief check while defending federal efforts against charges of foot-dragging. `` I do know that there's been a critic or two'' of the federal disaster-relief effort, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after a brief look at the storm damage. `` To the critics, I simply say: I understand. We are trying very hard.'' Almost from the moment he landed, the impact of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was evident. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 15-minute motorcade from <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> inland to <PERSON> Summerville </PERSON> took him past decimated trailer parks, dozens of roofless buildings and pine forests filled with trees snapped in half. In <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>, the president was shown around the <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> grounds, which were littered with smashed cars, fallen trees and twisted metal. He visited a community center where a school bus, flattened by a fallen tree, still stood in the driveway. Later, he flew in a helicopter over the <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coastline, where <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> had come ashore a week earlier, and flew low over some of the hardest hit areas of downtown <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Throughout, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered words of encouragement to residents of a state where 270,000 people were made jobless by the hurricane, where more than 200,000 people still have no electricity and where 50,000 are homeless. In <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>, he patted Mayor <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> on the shoulder, asked himself a question and then answered it. `` Why am I here?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm here to give a little encouragement to a courageous man.'' Touring a <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION> street lined with destroyed and damaged houses, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked to several residents and, patting one on the shoulder, said, `` What spirit.'' Besides offering encouragement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to respond to a week of rising criticism that the federal government has been too bureaucratic and too slow in helping victims of what Mayor <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> called `` the worst storm that ever happened to our state.'' The president was met as he landed by one of the most vocal critics, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who said it was `` absolutely ridiculous'' that only two federal disaster relief offices had been opened in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and who has complained that, when he asked for emergency power generators, he was told the proper forms had to be filled out first. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that `` our people are really hurting'' and that the president `` said he understood.'' The mayor also told reporters: `` I know his coming here helped us. We're glad he's here and I know by being here he will see and understand.'' Some area residents were skeptical. `` He's about seven days late. There's no use coming when everything's over,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Witham </PERSON>, 76, whose home on <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> was demolished in the storm. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> was not invited to join <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and several members of the state's congressional delegation on the tour. Later, as he ended his two-hour visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that the hurricane `` was tough. It was devastating. `` But the spirit of the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> came through loud and clear. ... You could n't help but be impressed to hear people say, ` We're going to bounce back.''' As for the complaints about the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, had described as `` as sorry a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses as I've worked with in my life,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` When all the dust is settled and the debris is removed, people are going to understand that this has been a total team effort.'' Earlier, in front of the demolished school bus, the president said, `` I'm here trying to mobilize the resources of the federal government.'' As part of that effort, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation shortly before arriving that makes $ 1.1 billion in emergency assistance available to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s victims. Of that, $ 400 million will go to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, $ 300 million to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, $ 200 million to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and $ 50 million to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said congressional aides who asked to remain anonymous. Some $ 150 million will be held by <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> for contingencies. The sources said that the breakdown, which does not appear in the legislation, was worked out between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the money, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just a day earlier, is needed to help people `` rebuild their homes, communities, businesses and lives.'' In addition to the $ 1.1 billion, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was making $ 5 million available for the retraining of displaced workers and other programs and that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had freed up $ 1.1 million to pay for storm-related police overtime and repairs to police facilities damaged by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had also directed that <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, with five disaster-relief offices in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, open four more in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and that the 200 employees taking requests for aid be increased by `` as many as it takes'' to process applications more quickly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his spokesman said, `` wants to make sure <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is committing all its resources effectively.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later issued a directive to all federal agency heads with employees in a stricken area, telling them to give paid time-off to any workers with a `` personal emergency because of the storm'' or who were needed for clean-up efforts. The president made his own donation to the relief effort, handing Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, a $ 1,000 check from himself and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which has committed a record $ 42 million to helping victims of the hurricane. Noting the various private relief efforts underway across the nation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters about a chat he had had in <LOCATION> Summerville </LOCATION>: `` One thing that touched me very much was a young homeowner there saying that he had had offers of help from all over this country. `` I think it does bring out the very best in the men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who want to help in a tragedy of this nature.''

 <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> says she might keep the remains of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> at their Hawaiian estate until the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> ruler can be buried in his homeland. `` My plan has always been to bring him back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said after her husband's death. `` I have committed myself to what is <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON>'s right to rest in peace in his motherland.'' <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s attorney general said it might take a court ruling to say how long <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body can remain at his <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 72, died Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after nearly nine months in the hospital. Doctors said kidney and lung failure and a widespread infection contributed to the cardiac arrest listed as the cause of death. There were no immediate plans for burial, she said, and an aide suggested that, barring their return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' remains might be above ground for a long time <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> law requires that a body be embalmed, buried or cremated within 30 hours of death, unless it is in the hands of a coroner, medical examiner or county physician. Morticians said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>'s embalmed body, which has been displayed in a bronze casket in the living room of his <LOCATION> Makiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> home since Thursday, could be preserved indefinitely. `` There is nothing that would prohibit the temporary display of a body in a private home if it does not create a health hazard or a nuisance,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. It could take a court ruling to define `` temporary,'' he said. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has forbidden her predecessor's return, even in death. She softened her rhetoric, however, slightly Thursday and said she may reconsider. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> official said Friday that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death could encourage his family and former associates to settle claims made by the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government in an attempt to avoid costly legal battles. `` We believe that there are cronies who were prevented from cooperating because of shame, not to mention fear of the president to whom they owe so much,'' said <PERSON> Mateo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caparas </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said, `` The Marcoses have always been and remain anxious to resolve the dispute, especially since their resolution could allow his burial in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and their -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' family's -RRB- eventual return.'' <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said there had been no attempts at plea bargaining in Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criminal case and said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death probably would have no effect on the case, since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was separated from the proceedings due to his ill health. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court to federal racketeering charges alleging she and her husband stole nearly $ 200 million from their impoverished country and stashed it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> continued to receive mourners at the hillside home Friday. She allowed a reporter to view her husband's body and could be seen smoothing his hair and crying. Several pro-Marcos Filipino congressmen, including Rep. <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> <PERSON> Ablan </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimoporo </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Friday for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to pay respects to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

 Representatives of private aid groups from 65 countries charged Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> are eroding self-reliance, self-determination and national sovereignty in the Third World. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Middaugh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policies </ORGANIZATION>, a private advocacy organization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said 200 people took part in the group's week-long meeting held at the same time as the annual meeting of the bank and fund. The bank and fund are owned by 152 governments, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding the largest voting power. The private group's statement cited the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate that debtor countries are transferring $ 50 billion to creditor countries this year, largely in interest and principal repayments on debt. largely because of payments on debt. `` With the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, cast in the role of debt manager, the debt crisis now defines ` development' as economic growth geared not to the needs of people or to safeguarding of the environment, but to debt repayment,'' the statement said. It added that the only way to avert a global crisis is to shift priorities away from getting Third World countries to make quick profits so they can keep up with their debts. `` Citizens' organizations participating in this week's forum demonstrated that these policies have brought the further erosion of national self-reliance, self-determination and sovereignty,'' it added. It complained that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is not giving enough information to private organizations on how the bank's projects affect the environment. `` As the bank and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> are public institutions, the non-governmental organizations community also called for ... lifting the veil of secrecy that surrounds bank and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> operations,'' it said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannigan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank, said it was up to countries where the bank has projects to divulge the bank's views on their environmental effects _ that the bank itself has to keep them confidential.

<TEXT>
 The man chosen by the new non-communist government to lead the attack on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crushing economic problems told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that Western aid depends on beginning `` difficult steps'' here. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> sketched a general outline of the government's economic plan in his appearance before the Sejm, or lower house of parliament. He said details would be revealed soon. The Sejm was debating a budget bill that allows the goverment to take on an additional $ 1.03 billion of deficit spending until the end of the year, for a total budget deficit of nearly $ 3.4 billion. Parliament members, voting 292-9 with 55 abstentions, authorized the increase as a stopgap measure to keep state enterprises running, although `` it means treating the illness with poison,'' Deputy <PERSON> Eugeniusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzozinski </PERSON> said. The deficit is considered one main cause behind the country's inflation, financing a flood of wage increases that in turn tend to push up prices <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> returned on Thursday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he attended a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and briefed Western lenders on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s plans and credit needs. <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> was nominated by non-communist Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and installed in his post only 17 days ago. He is in charge of tackling an economic crisis in which inflation is growing at a rate of 50 percent a month, industrial production is falling and store shelves empty. He wants a quick and radical overhaul of the economy to include privatizing state enterprises; making the national currency, the zloty, convertible; ending state subsidies to producers, and breaking up big state monopolies. Changes would be coordinated with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and Western lenders. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wants its $ 39 billion Western debt rescheduled to help <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> make the transition from a communist, state-dominated economy to a Western-style market economy. The painful steps <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> discussed already have raised objections in his own Solidarity camp. Some Solidarity lawmakers complained bitterly at a meeting Thursday that the government is allowing too many price increases. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> himself in remarks to reporters Thursday warned that too-rapid increases in prices would risk a `` civil war.'' `` Foreign aid will come ... only when we show readiness to take up difficult steps and make a great effort,'' <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> said in his speech. He said the prime item on the agenda is economic stability _ meaning fighting inflation and market shortages. He said the government will change the formula for automatic cost-of-living adjustments to make it less inflationary and introduce measures to check excessive wage growth; reduce state subsidies to producers, especially costly subsidies to the coal monopoly, and force enterprises to promptly pay their obligations to the government and to other enterprises. Also this year, the government will introduce anti-monopoly rules and create some form of anti-monopoly agency; introduce new regulations to force insolvent enterprises into bankruptcy; and create a market to facilitate selling shares of state enterprises, the official reported. <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> noted the changes would cause some enterprises to shut down or go bankrupt and said the state must prepare `` social safeguards suitable to a market economy.'' The government earlier discussed unemployment benefits and food stamps for the needy. <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> stressed in a separate interview with the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> must take forceful steps in order to receive help from the West. `` Any moves undermining our credibility ... automatically reduce the size and chances of any aid from other countries,'' he said. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> are expected here next month to conclude an agreement on a `` adjustment program'' in which <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would commit itself to economic reform. That would entitle <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> standby loan _ the green light to other lenders to reschedule <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s debts and extend new credits.

<TEXT>
 Mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has ignited the flashpowder of city politics, flaring racial and religious tension as he struggles to wrest Jewish voters from his black Democratic opponent. While <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s first-time candidacy has been dogged by missteps, the latest controversy is heightened by his unabashed intent to win Jewish votes by linking his opponent, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It is a naked effort to play on Jewish fears,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON> <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON>, a liberal Jewish leader, said Friday. `` The net effect of what he's doing is to increase racial polarization. It's a contemptible low blow.'' At issue is an advertisement placed by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in this week's edition of the city's largest-circulation Yiddish newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Algemeiner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> It shows two photos: in one, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a Republican, with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; in the other, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The text says: `` Let the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> choose their own destiny.'' The ad intensified a rift in the city's Jewish community, which made up the largest proportion of white voters for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> in the Sept. 12 primary, when he unseated three-term incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. On one side are critics such as <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON>, who said the ad plays unfairly on Jewish suspicions of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who supports Palestinian self-determination and once called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Hymietown,'' for which he later apologized. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> `` suspects that Jews hate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and he's playing on that hatred and that fear,'' said <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, he noted, has a history of supporting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Soviet Jewry and other Jewish causes. Yet others, such as <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Blachman </PERSON>, associate editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Algemeiner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, called the ad fair play. `` It shows who <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s surrounded with and who <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is surrounded with,'' he said. `` There's no words of racism. It just says the people have to decide.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> surveying damage from Hurricane Hugo, said he did n't want to comment on the ad placed by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, but he praised <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' mayoral campaign. `` I do n't want to violate the integrity of this mission -LRB- to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> -RRB- discussing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> politics,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is doing a very effective campaign, appealing to the hopes and not the fears of the people.'' According to polls, 22 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 3 million registered voters are black and 18 percent are Jewish. Of the total, about 2 million are Democrats. The message came at a moment of heightened sensitivity. Racial tensions arose here in August after a white gang killed a black youth in <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> _ a killing reminiscent of a 1986 racial attack in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Then Jewish comedian <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> supporter, suggested in an interview published this week that Jews were supporting <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> as a result of Jewish `` complexes,'' and said blacks had rarely backed Jewish causes. The Jewish Community Relations Council demanded repudiation of those remarks, saying the election `` should not be dragged into the gutter,'' and the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign dropped <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. The comedian apologized on Thursday. The council, an umbrella group of Jewish organizations, did not directly criticize the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> advertisement. Among Jews, `` Some consider it to be legitimate and some consider it to be illegitimate,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the council's director. `` It raises a lot of emotions.'' Properly or not, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has raised a double-edged sword, risking alienating some Jews while he attracts those who fear <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in a Dinkins mayoralty. `` The Jewish community is not a monolith,'' he said. Some analysts said the ad marked a necessary, if risky, step for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who trails <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> by more than 20 percentage points in the polls and must overcome a 5-1 Democratic edge in voter enrollment to win on Nov. 7. `` <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> does n't have the Jewish vote and he wants it,'' said <PERSON> Brickner </PERSON>. `` He thinks he needs it to win, and he's right. He's reaching out to the Jewish vote, grasping at it with every gimmick and tool he can use. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s strategists defended the approach. `` This ad has absolutely nothing to do with race. It has to do with who are the political supporters of the candidates,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager. `` It's a very fair question to ask what <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role will be in a <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> administration,'' <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON> said. `` It's the <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> campaign that brought <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> here. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was state co-chairman of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in black neighborhoods for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, albeit sparingly, late in the primary race, and he spoke at <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' primary-night celebration. Friday, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` my friend,'' reiterated his support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and said of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s ad: `` I know what he's trying to do I'd prefer that people would say and do things designed to bring people together, rather than divide them.'' Yet <PERSON> Blachman </PERSON>, the newspaper editor, said divisions already exist. `` Out the street I hear constantly that people are worried about the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> business,'' he said. `` They think <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is a very nice fellow. If <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was n't around him, he would n't have a problem with the Jewish people.

<HEAD>Government Accepts Responsibility for Multiracial Schools</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government, in a reversal of its integration policies, will take responsibility for some multiracial schools through funding or running them directly, a Cabinet official said Friday. <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clase </PERSON>, minister of white education, announced the new policy after a meeting Thursday with a delegation of people trying to prevent the closing of <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Enrollment has declined at the whites-only school and a committee of parents, teachers and students has campaigned to save the facility by opening it to all races. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, education spokesman for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Clase </PERSON>'s statement represented a `` dramatic shift in policy.'' The pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, denounced the decision. `` This is a scandalous break from all previous promises made by the minister of education and training with regard to this matter,'' it said. `` We wish to send an urgent warning to the white population that this latest step on the part of the government is the beginning of full integration at school level,'' the statement added. Most public schools would remain segregated under the new approach, but it would benefit families in certain urban neighborhoods that are in the process of being declared multiracial. Most of these areas have been integrated for years despite laws mandating residential segregation. <PERSON> Clase </PERSON> said Friday the government has a responsibility to provide education in `` free settlement areas'' _ the official term for neighborhoods that will be designated multiracial. He said the committee seeking to save <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> had two options _ it could transform the school into a 100 percent state-subsidized private school or apply to have the school's neighborhood become a free settlement area. At present, black, mixed-race and Indian children living in multiracial areas must either attend private schools or travel to segregated public schools in outlying townships.

 Angered by criticism of its crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> told Western nations Friday they were interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and stop it or risk harming relations. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> declared, in the first Chinese address to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> since the violence in June: `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has never feared and will in no way bend to any foreign pressure.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> delivered a long rebuke to certain Western countries _ not named _ and a discourse on peaceful coexistence. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s relations with Western countries were on a course of steady development,'' he said. `` However, difficulties of varying degrees have emerged over the past few months in our relations with certain Western countries.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> acknowleged that the crackdown on protesters `` is known to all.'' It began when hundreds of people were killed as the military swept across <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4. Speaking of the weeks of turmoil, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, `` It goes without saying that how to deal with this problem is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affair.'' He said most governments understand <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s actions. `` Only certain Western governments, ignoring the facts and basing themselves on nothing but distorted news reports and misinformation, leveled unwarranted charges against the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government and applied pressure on it.'' He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> respects the sovereignty of other countries and if Western nations wish to repair relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, they should do the same. `` Herein lies the way out of the current difficulties,'' he said. Even so, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> affirmed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will adhere to its policy of reform and opening to the outside world. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western countries have reproached <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for suppressing the protests, which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> calls an anti-government rebellion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> barred transfer of some military items to underscore its protests. In the past week, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, some nations in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> `` continued to attack the Chinese government groundlessly.'' In speeches to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> this week, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said nothing of the issue. Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it appealed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to release all political prisoners. The London-based human rights organization said in a message to Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> the release of prisoners would be `` a major contribution to the protection of human rights.'' Amnesty said its message specifically mentioned <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xizhe </PERSON>, who edited unofficial journals during the Chinese democracy movement in 1978 and 1979.

 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Friday to trade territory for peace and talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, saying a historic opportunity for peace is at hand. `` Conditions are now favorable for launching -LRB- <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> -RRB- dialogue without preconditions,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The dialogue, he said, `` aims at bridging the existing gap in positions, exploring the way to eliminate the conflict once and for all on the basis of applying the principle of territory for peace.'' He called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.'' He said the organization had adopted positive attitudes toward a peace settlement and `` deserves all welcome and support from the international community.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says it now accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and wants peace and a separate state. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, also rejects the concept of trading land for peace. Its rival in the coalition government, the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, favors territorial concessions. In a bid to keep <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> from torpedoing peace talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 10-point peace plan is negotiable `` The real question is what position the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> takes when the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meets next week,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at a news conference at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Egyptian 10 points is not a competing proposal, it is simply a method of trying to get implementation of the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposal,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. In May, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed elections among Palestinians to choose representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for limited self-government in the Israeli-occupied territories. `` The name of the game right now, it seems to me, is to _ for the first time _ get Israelis and Palestinians talking to each other,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> offered to host preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to pave the way for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> country to have made peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, for which it was effectively excommunicated from the Arab world. Only recently has <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> been welcomed back to the Arab fold, and it now seeks to act as a mediator in the troubled region. `` Letting the existing opportunity slip by will be a grievous mistake exceeding all errors made in the past, which led to loss of historic opportunities to contain the conflict and avoid its aggression,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10-point election proposal seeks to complement <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s own plan and win wider acceptance among Palestinians. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and radio late Thursday reported Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, met with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. During the meeting <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> made a rare phone call to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to wish him a happy Jewish new year and told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he did n't want to see the government divided over his peace plan, the reports said. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who heads Labor and also was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> and other leaders, returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> late Thursday. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> also advocated an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejects any conference that would impose a settlement on it and calls for bilateral negotiations with its neighbors. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it accepted an offer by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to host a meeting between it and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Committee, announced the acceptance in a statement published by the official Palestininan news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION>. The statement was released in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. The Soviet offer was made in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be willing to act as an intermediary between the two sides. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazen </PERSON>, said the Soviet proposal was `` an important step to advance the peace process in favor of a political solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict and the solution to the Palestinian problem.''

 The policy-setting body of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution Friday denouncing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear policies as a threat to peace and security. It also voted to continue the observer status of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but with a name change, and again postponed a decision on whether to suspend <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s membership in the agency A resolution sponsored by 14 states, including <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, was adopted on the last day of the annual General Conference of the <ORGANIZATION> IAEA </ORGANIZATION>. The vote was 47 in favor, 28 against, with 12 abstentions. It was opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western members. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, said the resolution went `` beyond the mandate and competence'' of the <ORGANIZATION> IAEA </ORGANIZATION>. The resolution said its sponsors were `` gravely concerned about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s growing nuclear capability and threat to peace and security in the area.'' It called on the Jewish state to submit all of its nuclear installations to the <ORGANIZATION> IAEA </ORGANIZATION> for inspection. The issue has been raised repeatedly at General Conference meetings and in a speech Wednesday Israeli chief delegate S.Y. <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON> said the 113-member agency wasted time with `` irrelevant'' political issues.

<TEXT>
 The owner of a tanker that spilled thousands of gallons of heating oil when it ran aground in June was fined $ 500,000 and the captain ordered to pay $ 35,500 in fines Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the captain, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, pleaded guilty Aug. 16 to one federal misdemeanor count each of violating clean water laws when nearly 300,000 gallons of oil spilled off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. Later Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> pleaded no contest to a state charge of causing pollution. A state charge against him of failing to have a harbor pilot on board the tanker was dropped as part of a plea bargain. The 560-foot tanker ran aground June 23 on <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, opening several gashes on its sides that were up to 250 feet long, with some wide enough for divers to swim through. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>'s fine was levied in federal court, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Georgudis </LOCATION> to pay $ 10,000. The captain's fines in state court totaled $ 25,000 In addition, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>'s insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingdom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bermuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, guaranteed $ 3.2 million to compensate for environmental damage, agreed to reimburse the state $ 1 million and the federal government $ 3.5 million for cleanup, and agreed to make $ 500,000 available for claims by individuals. Commercial fishermen and seafood dealers filed a federal lawsuit against the captain and the Liberian shipping company, seeking $ 40 million in damages they claim to have suffered as a result of the spill. `` They wo n't accept responsibility for the drop in shellfish price during the months of July and August,'' lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>. `` Are we going to have to chase the captain and the company back to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to satisfy our claim?'' The 560-foot tanker had sailed from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> but is registered in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> promised under the plea agreement to pay the state for environmental research and park acquisiton. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> put <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> on one month of unsupervised probation to ensure payment of the fine. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said he would not jail <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> because the captain cooperated with investigators, saying his actions were `` negligent, as opposed to willful or reckless.'' <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, 43, left court without comment. The captain could have received 13 months in prison on the state charges. The federal charge against <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and the captain carried a possible year in jail.

 <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was convicted of battery for slapping a police officer and two other misdemeanor charges Friday, prompting the fiery actress to remark, `` I think <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> ca n't be worse than this.'' But Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was acquitted of disobeying the officer when she drove away during a traffic stop confrontation. She said she interpreted an obscene phrase he allegedly used as an order to leave. In addition to the battery charge, the Hungarian-born actress was found guilty of driving without a valid driver's license and having an open bottle of alcohol in her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, convicted of the most serious of the charges, faces a possible 18 months and five days in jail and a maximum fine of $ 3,500, defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said. Sentencing was set for Oct. 17. `` I am very disappointed,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> told reporters outside court. `` I ca n't believe in a country as great as ours that a 6-foot-4 policeman can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4 and use dirty language like you were a streetwalker. ... I think <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> ca n't be worse than this, or Communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> either. I think it's ridiculous.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he would not ask for jail time for Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, but that he would seek compensation for the trial's cost `` I want the $ 30,000 restitution to the court for this media circus,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. The amount is the estimated cost of the trial. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> contended she was convicted because of her celebrity status. `` I know it's <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> _ the diamonds. She loves to talk up, she's not a milquetoast,'' she said. But jury foreman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> accountant, disagreed. `` That's not the person we really tried. We tried a person who had a conflict with the police,'' he said. The 12-member jury deliberated 90 minutes on Wednesday, all day Thursday and returned their verdicts Friday afternoon. Juror <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, an attorney, said there were plenty of arguments during the 12 hours of deliberation. `` We were n't in a deal-striking mood. There was no compromise,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. `` We came to the conclusion there was reasonable force used, even if she was pulled from the car.'' During the 15-day trial, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was fined $ 500 by Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> for violating what she called a `` gagging order'' by commenting to reporters on witnesses in the case. Another gag order violation allegation was dismissed by <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a motorcycle officer, pulled Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> over June 14 after noticing expired registration tags on the auto As he checked for other violations, she drove off. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> slapped <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> when he pulled her over a second time. He said the attack was unprovoked but she said she reacted in self-defense when he forcibly removed her from her car. <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannone </PERSON> said the verdict vindicated <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, `` who has been berated for the last three months simply because he was doing his job.'' The veteran celebrity's trial was distinguished by colorful expletives and theatrics normally associated with the make-believe jurisprudence of television's `` Divorce Court'' and `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>.'' The carnival atmosphere culminated Friday in a late-afternoon bomb threat that forced county marshals to briefly empty the courthouse. No bomb was found. Later, a county sheriff's bus filled with inmates drove away from the courthouse, with its occupants chanting `` <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON>.'' Chattering from topics like jailhouse lesbians to comparisons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> attracted as much media attention during her case as she did in any previous TV or film performance. `` I am the daughter of a freedom fighter,'' the star of such films as `` Queen of Outer Space'' and `` Boys Night Out'' told reporters during her trial. `` I am a horsewoman ... I am a princess. I am <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON>.'' Upset by testimony that depicted her in a different light _ as a self-important, foul-mouthed shrew _ Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> stormed out of the courtroom in tears on four occasions. `` I want to go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' she said after one such walkout. She is evasive about her age, but court documents put it at 66. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s defense hinged on the contention that <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was a tempermental brute who had a history of manhandling suspects. `` I was screaming, ` Help, help, help!,'' she said in tear-filled testimony. `` I was afraid of the police. They were going to shoot me.'' The trial, lasting much longer than first anticipated, cost taxpayers an estimated $ 30,000.

<TEXT>
 CBS is investigating reported claims that the `` CBS Evening News'' in the mid-1980s aired faked combat footage in reports on the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' board of affiliates said Friday. `` We've been assured that they're checking into it and I accept that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate <ORGANIZATION> WRAL-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and chairman of the affiliate board's news subcommittee. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said he had n't talked with the network's news division about the claims of faked combat footage by a free-lance cameraman. The claims were reported Wednesday in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Post story. Speaking by phone from <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, he said that the network's assurance of an internal investigation into the matter was given him by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate relations executives `` I respect CBS News,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> added. `` I think they do a great job, and I know that they would n't knowingly'' air staged news footage. `` But since the charge has been levelled, obviously they will check into it and respond to it.'' There have been reports that such an internal investigation was underway and that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was readying a point-by-point rebuttal of the Post story. But the division's has declined to comment. That still was the response on Friday when a CBS spokesperson was asked about the investigation to which <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> referred. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> on Wednesday defended the integrity and accuracy of his division's Afghan war coverage, but only in a statement that was general in nature, not specific. He did not return a reporter's calls to his office on Friday. The Post's story on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' Afghan war coverage had questioned the film footage of the war taken by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, a free-lance camerman. Calls Friday to <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s residences in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> were not returned.

 A man recently convicted on tax evasion counts was carrying a briefcase stuffed with money when he was shot and killed at a bail bonds company, a newspaper reported Friday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON>, who was killed by a shotgun blast Tuesday, had $ 10,000 in his briefcase at the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON>, who was convicted last week of tax evasion, conspiracy and bribery of an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official, said during the summer that federal agents tried to recruit him to set up Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> in an unspecified phony land deal. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office have denied any scheme to recruit the 41-year-old Moussallem to entrap <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>. A shotgun blast struck <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON> in the face while he and four other men were in a house where a bail bond company operated. One of the men, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>, who is running against Republican Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> in next year's party primary, said they were planning a fund-raising barbecue for <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>'s candidacy. <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> initially told reporters Tuesday that he was in the room when <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON> was shot by the bail bondsman, <PERSON> Hoyette </PERSON> <PERSON> Goggans </PERSON>, in what <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> described as an accident. But the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that he was not in the room. A <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> radio station, WBHM, broadcast an interview on Friday in which <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> said that the newspaper account was wrong. No one answered the phone at <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>'s home Friday in an attempt for further comment. <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>, 68, a retired real estate agent, has run unsuccessfully for the state <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>, mayor of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> and secretary of state. <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON> was a developer who unsuccessfully tried to bring a water theme park to the area. The city, under <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>'s administration, had planned to lend Moussallem $ 3 million for construction costs at the park, but the plan was later rejected by the courts All the witnesses in the room said the shooting was an accident. Federal investigators, however, have not yet ruled out foul play. The News quoted <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> as saying Thursday he had walked away from the table where the men were sitting and was not in the room. He said he ran to the telephone to call authorities after he heard the shot, not knowing who was injured. <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> said he never returned to the room, but walked into the back yard, where he remained. `` I never saw the body or the gun,'' the News reported he said. On Friday, however, he told the radio station, `` I never told anybody I was n't in the room.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON>'s briefcase, found at the shooting scene, contained at least $ 10,000 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> attorney who was the Democratic nominee for governor in 1986 and who helped defend <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON> in the tax case, said <PERSON> Moussallem </PERSON> was to come to his office later Tuesday to pay him the remaining $ 15,000 of his fee. <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> police are refusing to comment, saying that all information must come from District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is bringing home the remains of a controversial 19th century ruler to persuade his people to forgive military abuses of a decade ago. The body of Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> is to arrive Saturday aboard a plane from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where it was sent after exhumation from a grave in <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, on Sept. 21. <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> ruled over a confederation of newly independent and rebellious provinces from 1835 until his ouster in 1852. He died in exile in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is expected to use the return of the strongman's remains as a backdrop to announce he will pardon some or all of the 18 generals and admirals facing trial on charges they abused human rights in a brutal campaign against leftist subversives during the 1976-83 military regime. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who took office on July 8, has repeatedly said pardons are needed to repair the decade-old rift the abuses caused between the military and civilians. Human rights groups, including relatives of nearly 9,000 people who disappeared during the military campaign, fiercely oppose any pardons. Leftist political parties and even a small faction of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also are against the move. An estimated 50,000 opponents marched in downtown <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> on Sept. 8 and called for `` trial and punishment'' of the accused officers. `` They can hold a million marches, but the decision has already been made,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said recently. `` I've been talking about pacifying the country since before my election on May 14.'' Some human rights and political groups vowed to obtain a million signatures by Sunday on petitions objecting to any plan to pardon military officers accused or convicted of human rights violations. Organizers said Friday they would set up booths on streets and in plazas throughout the country to collect signatures. `` Far from pacifying the country, any kind of pardon would endanger democracy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON>. In repatriating the body of <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON>, hailed as a hero by nationalists and condemned as a bloodthirsty tyrant by liberals, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> chose a case that illustrates how political animosities can endure in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` At other times in our national life, the repatriation of the remains of this national hero would have generated a storm of criticism,'' said <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> Provincial Gov. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>. Now, `` we're leaving behind a past that divided us.'' Plans call for a round of ceremonies after which <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> will be reburied in a family crypt in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recoleta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, also the final resting place of dozens of his enemies. When <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> died in exile in 1877, his enemies swore `` not even the dust of his bones'' would ever be allowed to return to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The idea of repatriating his remains was first brought up by <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, and the plan has provoked little public opposition aside from a few newspaper columns and several letters to editors. Government-sponsored television ads have appeared in recent days showing portraits of <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Faustino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarmiento </PERSON>, one of his most bitter enemies, the blue-and white Argentine flag, a dove and the admonition to `` reconcile the past to resolve the future.'' Red posters bearing a likeness of a uniformed <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> and the message `` Welcome to the fatherland without quarrels'' have been plastered on walls along city streets. A wealthy landowner of aristocratic birth, <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> headed the <ORGANIZATION> Federalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1828, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Provinces </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plate </LOCATION> were trying to organize themselves into the country that would become <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. He was governor of the Province of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s largest and wealthiest province, from 1829 to 1831 and was asked by the legislature to return with dictatorial powers in 1835 <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> was constantly at war with regional rivals and used a militia to dominate the other, poorer provinces.

 Federal drug agents seized 20 tons of cocaine with a street value of up to $ 20 billion Friday at a warehouse in a quiet section of the city, and officials called it the biggest drug haul in history. Three men were arrested and about $ 10 million in cash was seized at the warehouse on an upscale, tree-lined street in a mostly residential community of <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> foothills, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s agent in charge for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I've been on this job for 25 years, and I've never seen so much dope in one place,'' <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I could n't believe it.'' The three Mexican men, who were not immediately identified, were expected to be arraigned Monday on charges of possessing and distributing cocaine. In addition to the drugs and cash, agents seized financial records, customer lists and a large truck-trailer that was parked at the warehouse's entrance. No weapons were found. The seized records offered a list of leads that was `` endless,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, during a news conference Friday. <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON> placed the street value of the drug at $ 20 billion. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> valued the haul at one-tenth that amount, based on a price of $ 100 a gram for pure cocaine, which he called `` a very conservative estimate.'' But <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> later said that when the cocaine was prepared for smoking, it could bring in far more. `` If it's rocked up in the form of crack, it could go as high as 10 times above that, up to $ 20 billion,'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said by telephone, explaining that the figure was based on diluting the cocaine to the maximum amount possible and converting it to rock form to be sold individually on the street. Using <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police techniques to calculate the value of diluted cocaine on the street _ $ 170,250 per pound _ the value of the drug would be nearly $ 7 billion. `` This seizure should put to rest any further speculation that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is in fact the major pathway for cocaine entering the country and has in fact become a major distribution center in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said. However, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cautioned against drawing conclusions that the bulk of cocaine entry into the country had shifted to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We are not in a position to say that there is a major shift in trends in cocaine coming into the country,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON>. Through the third quarter of fiscal 1989 ending June 30, a total of 18.4 tons of cocaine had been seized in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, compared with 2.2 tons in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said. In fiscal 1988, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> seized 31.7 tons of cocaine, compared with 2.06 tons in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't make conclusions about overall trends and patterns based on one seizure, despite the magnitude of that particular seizure,'' <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said. Friday's haul easily topped the previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record of more than 8,700 pounds recorded in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in 1987, and surpassed the world record, a 12-ton seizure in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>. The huge stash, arranged in orderly rows up to 10 feet high along the warehouse's walls, was linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> drug cartels of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said. `` These are n't just drug runners,'' <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said. `` These are the major drug dealers. They do n't get any bigger than this until you get to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office here believe that more than half the cocaine distributed in the country now floods in through <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Colombian drug groups bring it across the border from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> street gangs distribute it in more than 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, they have said. Cash seizures from the drug trade totaled more than $ 100 million last year in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, topping <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the first time. The city's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> surplus _ one way of measuring illegal money laundering _ has jumped by more than 2,000 percent in five years, to $ 3.8 billion last year. `` The cocaine trafficking is in a state of constant flux,'' and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> `` continue to be very heavy cocaine areas,'' <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Cocaine today is coming into the country all along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said. `` That's a trend that has been continuing since the early'80s.'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said evidence from Friday's seizure would tie into another a yearlong investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police and several other police departments. Officials said Friday's seizure came after they received a tip this week and witnessed a sale of 20 kilos of cocaine. They then got a search warrant for the warehouse. Authorities moved in about midnight on the building in the north <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, about 25 miles from downtown. Across the street from the carefully landscaped warehouse are offices for the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; other neighbors include a manufacturer of pacemakers and a hydraulic pump supplier. The warehouse, which did not appear to have any unusual security systems, is two miles from Interstate 5, the main north-south thoroughfare for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> had been investigating and conducting `` intense surveillance'' for a year before moving in on the warehouse. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> has joined a chorus of state and local officials complaining the federal government should do more to stop drug trafficking here.

 Bombings Friday night rattled a nonprofit medical clinic in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> and a school in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, injuring one woman, police said. Thirty residences in the school's neighborhood sustained slight damage when someone in a passing car tossed the bomb, and a woman inside the facility at the time of the explosion was hospitalized but her immediate condition was unknown, police said. The Comfamiliar clinic, a nonprofit medical center in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, also was bombed but there were no injuries, police said. Details were sketchy late Friday of the circumstances surrounding the blasts, and there was no claim of responsibility, authorities. Earlier Friday, soldiers and police searched cars for guns and explosives at dozens of checkpoints after a car bomb blamed on drug traffickers ripped through a hotel parking garage. Police said one person suffered minor injuries in the blast Thursday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Tequendama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercontinental </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s retired officers' association. Three other bombs caused minor damage elsewhere in the nation. In <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, headquarters for the world's most powerful cocaine cartel, police said Friday they found the bodies of two people who had been tied up and shot in the head. Police said they did not have a motive for the slayings, but execution-style murders are frequently the work of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine traffickers Meanwhile, a judge rejected an appeal and cleared the way for the government to extradite another Colombian to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug charges, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would only say it was preparing a statement on the case. The suspect, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, was arrested three weeks ago. A judge in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, 500 miles north of the capital, Thursday rejected a plea for her release, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. To protect judges from reprisals in drug cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> often withholds their identities. In the past 10 years, 220 court employes, including 41 judges, have been murdered, most of them by cocaine traffickers. The traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every Colombian extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of the government's 6-week-old crackdown on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine cartels. None has been killed despite one extradition, that of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, who was flown to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Sept. 6 to face money-laundering charges. Ms. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is not among the top 12 cocaine traffickers wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the destination of up to 80 percent of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine. The bomb at the <ORGANIZATION> Tequendama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercontinental </ORGANIZATION> was the third placed in a hotel in the past five days. Another bomb exploded Thursday night in the capital, at a government electric company's transformer substation in southern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police said. Two bombs exploded in the western <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> on Thursday night, one at a bank's automatic teller machine and the other at a warehouse owned by a bank, police said by telephone. Mayor <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said in a televised speech Thursday night the army and police were stepping up security in the capital to try to catch terrorists before they can deliver bombs. On Friday, security forces searched cars at various points in the city of 6 million, then moved on to set up new checkpoints. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> said there would be up to 120 checkpoints at any given time. In the last two weeks, with only a few checkpoints, <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> security forces have inspected 12,330 vehicles and have found 363 pounds of dynamite, 145 guns and 17,153 rounds of ammunition, <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> said.

 The death toll in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' worst school bus crash rose to 21 on Friday when a 15-year-old passenger died from injuries she suffered when the bus careened into a water-filled pit. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> died late Friday morning. The cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest, but <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Symonds </PERSON> said she was a drowning victim. She had been in critical condition since the accident. <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> was the sister of 18-year-old <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who also died in the wreck. Their 17-year-old sister, <PERSON> Estela </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, survived the accident. The victims of the bus-truck collision were junior and senior high school students. More than 60 were injured. Eleven remained hospitalized Friday. Meanwhile, federal safety investigators continued to look for clues in the Sept. 21 wreck at <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, 15 miles from the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said he was waiting for a final briefing from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether to file charges against the driver of the soft-drink delivery truck. The driver told authorities that the truck's brakes failed and he went through a stop sign, striking the bus, causing it to fall into the pit. A preliminary investigation showed the brakes were working, officials have said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Friday announced a postponement of its plan to return <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s electricity industry to private ownership and cited the complexity of the sale. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON> issued a statement saying, `` The government remains on target to complete the privatization of the industry within this Parliament.'' But it also said that maintaining the previous timetable `` would require additional transitional arrangements which would have introduced added complexity to the task and made it more difficult for us to meet our objective.'' General parliamentary elections must be called before mid-1992. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government plans to divide into two companies the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which now has a monopoly to supply electricity to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Twelve existing regional boards are to be turned over to private companies that will buy electricity and sell it to consumers in their region. Under the new plan the regional boards are expected to be sold in the fall of 1990 instead of spring or summer 1990. The generating companies would be sold in the first half of 1991 instead of fall 1990 to spring 1991. The privatization, expected to raise anywhere from $ 24 billion to $ 44 billion, faces strong opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other groups that believe the utilities should remain in state hands. The government, claiming nationalization of industries stifled the economy and seeking to promote capitalism, has sold many state companies to private firms for billions of dollars over the past decade.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist guerrillas said Friday they will not accept even an unconditional cease-fire offer from the government because there would be no guarantee of safety or democracy. Guerrilla representatives said they expected Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to offer an `` immediate, unconditional, unilateral'' cease-fire when he speaks to to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> General Assembly Monday, and they were rejecting the offer in advance. `` If there are no guarantees a cease-fire is a fiction,'' said <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s political-diplomatic commission, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They will keep imprisoning our activists, there will still be violence,'' he said. `` It's all a kind of show.'' He and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saenz </PERSON>, another member of the commission, accused <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government of widespread human rights violations since it took office on June 1. They claimed the government is arresting and beating many leftist activists and then releasing them without charges. The government has denied such allegations. <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saenz </PERSON> said the guerrillas launched an offensive Tuesday to protest human rights violations, assert the rebels' presence and pin down government troops Guerrilla attacks have been reported in 10 of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 14 provinces. But the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> officials said they still were optimistic about chances for progress at a meeting between rebel and government representatives set for Oct. 16-17 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said the momentum for peace in the region, reflected by the agreement to disband Nicaraguan rebels in exchange for democratic elections in their country, and internal pressure in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will push the government to a reasonable position. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old war has taken more than 70,000 lives and ravaged the economy in the nation of 5 million despite a total of $ 3.8 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid. <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said a cease-fire would have to be part of an overall agreement for peace and democracy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the rebels made specific proposals to that end at a meeting with the government in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` We want to negotiate the conditions that will allow us to vie for power on the political path,'' said <PERSON> Saenz </PERSON>. `` That's the key point.'' He said the guerrillas are no longer asking for a power-sharing arrangement before a settlement is reached. In a peace proposal made in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the rebels demanded judicial reforms, an end to repression, maintenance of land and economic reforms made since 1980 and changes in the military. They also asked for constitutional reforms and clearly defined cease-fire lines.

About 20 protesters bearing signs reading, `` <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> resign'' and `` no to papal talks,'' greeted the archbishop at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s secretary for ecumenical affairs, <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said earlier he did not expect immediate union of the churches because, `` talks about closer relations have been going steadily on for 30 years.'' `` I am sure it will happen eventually because the founder of Christianity wanted one church,'' he said. Anglican leaders said they thought unity between Anglicans and Catholics would not come until the 21st century.

<HEAD>Court Begins Term With Abortion Issue Heading Closely Watched Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> begins its new term much where it left off last summer _ with the issue of abortion heading the list of closely watched cases. After a three-month recess, the justices return to the bench today to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legal and political disputes. None is likely to be more divisive, or a better bellwether of the court's conservative course, than abortion. The court will hear arguments in three abortion cases, probably in December or January, that will determine whether it will expand the new regulatory power it gave states last July. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law Professor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said the July ruling `` began, in a very major way, the dismantling of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' the court's 1973 ruling that established a right to abortion. `` The court may never say <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is overruled, but is likely to say, ` <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ... never heard of it','' <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said. Officials from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> are urging the justices to allow laws requiring young, unmarried girls to get parental consent before having abortions. In the third case, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is seeking stricter control over clinics that perform the great majority of abortions. The state officials are not asking the court to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, which legalized abortions nationwide. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which urged the court last term to reverse the 1973 ruling, is taking a lower profile this time. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not participate in oral arguments in any of the three cases, although it is expected to submit a legal brief supporting <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s parental consent law. The abortion debate in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was recast dramatically by the court's July 3 ruling in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case cutting back abortion rights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain. The court, by a 5-4 vote, said states may require doctors to administer tests for determining whether a fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb. It also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortions in public hospitals. Holding the balance of power in that case _ and perhaps for the future of abortion rights _ is <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the only female justice in the court's history. In a separate concurring opinion in July, she said the Missouri regulations do not place an `` undue burden'' on a woman's right to an abortion. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said she was not prepared to decide then whether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> are ready to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> voted to do so. Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> reaffirmed their support of the 1973 holding. The July ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the state legislatures, where rejuvenated women's rights activists and anti-abortion forces are taking the battle. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> remains an important arena for the fight. Here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docket this term: _ The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Turnock </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>, could be the most important The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> struck down regulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics to become `` the functional equivalent of small hospitals.'' The clinics, where nearly all early abortions are performed, would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment and services that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety. The cost of an abortion could rise by nearly $ 50. The case could have broad significance if the court decides to water down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rights established by <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. That ruling generally prohibits states from imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensive or difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy. _ In <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the court will review a system that requires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receive notification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion is performed Alternatively, the girl may bypass parental notification by convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion for herself. The system was in force for five years before a federal judge ruled it was unconstitutional. But the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed the judge's ruling. _ The second parental notification case, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, raises similar issues An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law requires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone to one parent 24 hours prior to the abortion, or by regular and certified mail 48 hours in advance. Alternatively, a judge would have up to 22 days to decide whether to permit the minor's abortion. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law, passed in 1985, never took effect before it was struck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has allowed states to regulate abortions for unmarried minors more strictly than for adult women. The justices, in a decision announced two months before <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined the court, split 4-4 in 1987 over the validity of such regulation by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 All the world loves a lover, particularly the Nielsen-family world. So tonight, <PERSON> Shanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> will wed <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> sitcom, `` Major Dad.'' Odds are the ratings will be up. This is because marriage, even in a sitcom, is a serious step. But if the script called for it, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, who essays a widow with three daughters, could sing and dance her way down the aisle with <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON>'s hard-nosed, soft-hearted Corps character, Maj. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacGillis </PERSON>. At 17, she was in the chorus line of a Gay Paree show in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. A few years later, she was playing <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, in the national touring company of <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION>'s still-running musical hit, `` A Chorus Line.'' One Broadway musical called `` Dancing'' later, she was starting life anew as an actress in `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> soap opera. Such is the nature of TV that the show was taped in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` They told us no <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accents,'' she reports. `` It makes you wonder.'' A tall, lithe, hazel-eyed woman with a happy-go-lucky manner, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and raised in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, first in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. She is no stranger to big families or show business. She was one of six kids in her family, she says, when <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a big-band leader who became her stepfather, proposed to her mother. A seventh child was born of that marriage. All this, plus the life of a chorus gypsy, plus acting studies with teachers from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Neighborhood Playhouse and Actors' Studio, readied her for the Great Adventure of 1981 _ moving to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` I like an adventure,'' she says. `` I'm a sucker for a challenge. I had money saved and I thought, ` I'll give it a year, or one big job, and then I'll go back.''' She stayed, save for a memorable trip back here in 1983. That was for the night she and some 300 present and former `` Chorus Line'' players, dashing on and off stage at the <LOCATION> Shubert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theatre </LOCATION>, all reprised their roles in the show as it broke the record for Broadway's longest-running musical. That extravagant evening was much like a family reunion, says <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, even though some of the clan that night had played in the show in such off-Broadway locales as <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and even <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. She had been touring with it in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> when she decided it was time to leave what for 17 months had been her family. Her first months in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> proved a different matter altogether. She had an agent, and lived with one of her sisters. But she did n't know anyone else in town, she says. She also found it a paradoxical place. Even though actors there come and go so quickly it is said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Andretti </PERSON> drives the welcome wagon, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> discovered that TV producers and casting directors wanted to be sure she'd stay put before they'd talk roles. `` You have to make them believe that you're going to stay there for awhile beyond the -LRB- series -RRB- pilot season,'' she says. She did that but continued her stage work, acting in five plays in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As she had hoped, she landed TV work. Her dossier includes `` The Colbys,'' `` Cheers,'' `` Newhart'' and two movies about dancers, `` Legs'' and `` Mirrors.'' She landed co-stardom in ` Major Dad'' after one get-acquainted interview with the producers in which they just talked, and then three auditions. After she got the job, she also hung out at a newspaper for a while, watching reporters at work. This is because her mother-of-three character, <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, also is a reporter for a fictional <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> newspaper near the big, real Marine base, <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>. As a journalistic courtesy, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, when interviewed at the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> here, was invited to write a news story. She sat down at one of the computers that reporters use nowadays. As she typed away, she was advised that a network headquarters, not that of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, was located right across the street. She just grinned and kept typing. Part of what she wrote said this: `` It was a dark and stormy afternoon sitting across from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. Oops, just kidding, that's all for now, got ta go and run down a real story.''

 When lighthouse keeper <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> flicks on a switch 15 minutes before sunset, illuminating <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> and the surrounding harbor, he is following a tradition that began in 1716. <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> is the last in a succession of lightkeepers that began with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthylake </PERSON>, who drowned with his family when his boat overturned on the way back to the island in November 1718. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> wrote a poem about the tragedy. Now, it's not tragedy, but technology that threatens to force <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> to leave his post on this rocky, picturesque islet. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>, one of the few remaining manned lighthouses in the country, is scheduled to be the last one automated next year. `` It'll be the last page in a long chapter of American history,'' said <PERSON> Dever </PERSON>, the 29-year-old son of a onetime lighthouse keeper. `` This country was built on lighthouses, showing boats where to go. It's sad to think that after 273 years, there wo n't be a keeper here.'' Only six other lighthouses in the country are still manned and they are scheduled to be automated within the next several months, according to <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, of the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighthouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The lighthouses are located in Egmont Key, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; on <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; on <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> coast; and on the <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bath </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where there are two. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., has introduced legislation that would retain <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> as the last manned lighthouse and keep it from being automated <PERSON> Dever </PERSON>, a petty officer 1st class in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> who has supervised a crew of two at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Light for the past 18 months, acknowledged, `` I was n't happy at first when I got here but then I learned to like it.'' Although he's at home with his wife of five years only one week each month because of his schedule, <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> said he has come to love life at the lighthouse. The sunny, whitewashed buildings by day give way to often eerie nights. Ghosts, perhaps the souls of shipwreck victims or the mysterious `` Lady in Black,'' are said to stalk the island. <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> and his crew, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandrelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ux </PERSON>, live in a comfortable, two-story, gabled house on one end of the island. There is no sign of dust or clutter in the neat, carpeted living room where bow windows overlook the pounding <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the lights of downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 11 miles away. `` I feel an attachment to the old keepers,'' said <PERSON> Dever </PERSON>. After arriving at the light, he found the names of old keepers scratched in rocks all over the island. <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> has since etched his name on a a piece of granite outside the house. <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> named the island's black cat, <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, after a lighthouse keeper in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, who made hundreds of rescues during her 32-year tenure in the mid-1800s. The island dog, 13 years old, is named <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON>, a holdover from a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> crew who were fans of the old `` Charlie's Angels'' TV series, which starred <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON>. It is a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Light tradition, according to <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> and his crew, to paint <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON>'s toenails pink The island is dominated by the 89-foot lighthouse, where 76 wrought iron steps lead to the tower. There, two 1,000-watt bulbs positioned behind a five-ton Fresnel lens consisting of 336 glass prisms are bent into thin pencil beams of light that flash every 10 seconds. The light is visible for 27 miles. At night, looking up from the bottom of the tower, the beams of light radiate out into the sky like bicycle spokes. Depending on what day it is, <PERSON> Dever </PERSON> or one of his men rise early and turn the light off 15 minutes after sunrise. When it's cloudy or foggy, of course, the light is left on. Through the years, all variety of human drama has been played out on the island. There was romance. In 1853, Harbor Pilot <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> proposed to the keeper's daughter <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, at the top of the tower. She accepted. Shipwrecks were common. One of the worst occurred in November 1861 when the square rigger <PERSON> Maritana </PERSON> broke up on rocks near the island in a snowstorm. Bodies from the wreck washed up on the island for months and at least one sailor is buried somewhere on the island. There was skulduggery. Around 1845, the lighthouse keeper <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> made cheap cigars that sold as expensive Spanish imports in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> until he was discovered. There was even a birth. <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, born at the light in April 1932, was the inspiration for <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>'s book `` Storm Child.'' Two years ago, the <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> family held a reunion at the lighthouse.

<HEAD>Wise Home Buying Requires an Educated Consumer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Make a mistake when shopping for food or clothing and the loss usually is n't a big deal. But that's not the case when seeking shelter. A home is the biggest purchase of a lifetime for most families. And since most folks do n't buy houses all that often, they have relatively little experience in dealing with the complicated legal procedures, the often confusing terms and the many potential mistakes that can be made. Since being an unwary buyer can cost thousands of dollars over the years, it is usually wise to invest a few dollars in advance, becoming informed about the problems houses can have and about the pitfalls of buying. To begin with, make sure the house is sturdy. There's nothing worse than investing a life's savings in what seems to be a good home, only to have it filled with repair headaches or worse. Professional inspection services operate in most larger cities and can check out a home for $ 100 or so, providing a report on its condition and recommending needed repairs. Consumer experts recommend that buyers of older homes have an inspection before committing themselves to the deal. And considering the periodic reports of flaws and problems in some new housing, inspections might not be a bad idea even in that case. A professional inspection is especially important if the house has a septic tank system. But before hiring an inspector, check out their credentials. Federal housing officials warn that some folks who have gone into the inspection business exaggerate flaws and then offer to make repairs at inflated costs. Things to have carefully checked in older homes include run-down equipment such as the furnace, air conditioning and water heaters. Wet basements may also be a problem, and the home should be checked for termites, inadequate or outdated wiring, faulty plumbing and the condition of the roof. While you're thinking about all this, of course, people are tossing around words like amortization and easement, swayle and casement, <PERSON> Gambrel </PERSON> roof and quitclaim deed. It's enough to boggle the mind. A wise buyer will do a bit of homework beforehand, and there are some low-cost booklets available from the government that can help prevent at least a few housing headaches. `` Wise Home Buying'' is a good one to start with. Only 24 pages, this booklet from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> packs in lots of advice and warnings, reminders of problems to watch for and how to avoid many of them. Two other nearly essential booklets are simple lists of terms and what they mean _ keys to the complicated terminology of today's housing `` Home Buyer's Vocabulary'' lists terms dealing with deeds, sales and legal considerations in the purchase of a house, while `` Homeowners Glossary of Building Terms'' includes housing construction terms. These and several other handy housing-related booklets may be purchased from the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, 81009. Order as follows: _ `` Wise Home Buying,'' $ 1, item number 163V. _ `` Home Buyer's Vocabulary,'' $ 1, item number 161V. _ `` Homeowner's Glossary of Building Terms,'' $ 1, item number 162V. _ `` A Consumer's Guide to Mortgage Lock-Ins,'' 50 cents, item 426V. _ `` A Consumer's Guide to Mortgage Refinancing,'' 50 cents, item 427V. _ `` Consumer Handbook on Adjustable-Rate Mortgages,'' 50 cents, item 428V. _ `` Mortgage Money Guide,'' $ 1, item 137V. _ `` How to Buy a Manufactured -LRB- Mobile -RRB- Home,'' 50 cents, item 429V. _ `` <ORGANIZATION> Simple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repairs </ORGANIZATION> _ Inside,'' $ 1.50, item 141V.

 The capital gains bill still has a long way to go before it becomes law, but already you can feel some faint stirring of discontent about its limitations. Criticism of two aspects of the bill just passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are bound to make their way into discussions in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. First of them is the absence of any inflation adjustment for existing asset-holders. Next is the two-year limitation on the reduction. Almost forgotten in such discussions will be an awareness of the ostensible reason for the cut, which is to provide the federal government with more revenue rather than to do favors for certain constituencies. As passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the capital gains tax bill would lower to 19.6 percent the highest tax bracket for capital gains, which are the financial rewards of long-term investments _ equities, stocks, real estate and the like. Most people with capital gains now pay 28 percent to 33 percent. Those less well off also may have important capital gains, political oratory notwithstanding. Their tax would drop to 10.5 percent from 15 percent. These percentages, however, would last just two years, after which the tax would return to 28 percent and 15 percent. Thereafter, capital investments would be indexed to wring out the false profit of inflation. By this means, it is hoped, individuals will be encouraged to sell their investments now gathering dust, at which time they will be compelled to pay capital gains taxes, which are assessed only after the assets are sold. It is generally believed that many people have been holding on to their assets because they can not afford to sell and pay the tax. Not just the very rich either. Some ordinary folks have seen their money expand 10 times in 20 years. No doubt, some of these people will view the two-year period as a rare opportunity, and so will take the cash, pay the tax and reinvest in something more in keeping with their current life style. Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s revenues will rise. However, there is less certainty on another contention: that investors will be encouraged by lower taxes to invest in new enterprises that will grow into firms employing lots of people and paying lots of taxes. Criticism on this score will come from a wide variety of small-business people, including venture capitalists, who already are saying that two years is not enough. Capital investments are long term, they say. Two years is not. As they see it, if this aspect of the law is to encourage entrepreneurial investments, it must be extended by several more years, or even indefinitely. Two years, they say, is not enough time to earn a respectable profit. Perhaps an even larger squawk could come from investors who feel that past inflation should be deducted from their capital gains. They have a point, because inflation might account for half their so-called profits, or even more. It is conceivable that even with the tax deduction some people could end up as losers. Such an unhappy situation could result, for example, if the rate of inflation approached, equaled or exceeded the investment rate of return. Logic would seem to apply to the past as well as to the future. If those with gains after 1992 are to be tax-exempted from inflation why should n't earlier investors be treated in the same fashion? You might think the answer is clear cut, but it is n't. Logic is not the issue, taxes are. The whole idea is to raise revenues, spur economic activity and try to finance the government _ not to provide justice. The latter belongs to another, entirely separate branch of government.

 Some chant. Some meditate. Some dance. Some sit in the lotus position and hum. Every year hundreds of devotees of the occult trek to <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped inside the pyramids of the pharaohs <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chephren </PERSON> and Mycerinus. Pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills, give glimpses into the future, provide a better night's sleep, even halt aging _ all for the price of admission, three Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 1.20 -RRB-. Until now. Under new rules, pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more _ a lot more. <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giza </PERSON> <PERSON> Plateau </PERSON>'s director general, said groups of up to 15 now are allowed `` to meditate or seek extrasensory powers'' in the pyramids for 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 400 -RRB- and only outside normal tourist hours. Each extra participant pays 50 pounds -LRB- $ 20 -RRB-. <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to conduct seances inside the pyramids. Most want either to spend the night inside or to enter at the first rays of dawn. `` In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and elsewhere you have a lot of people with problems, and these people are seeking solutions. They look to the supernatural, and they think of the pyramids,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. `` But we ca n't let these groups interfere with tourists wanting to look at the pyramids from a historical or architectural standpoint.'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said the most active pyramid-visiting mystical groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are several from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and from the <ORGANIZATION> Edgar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cayce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, named after the American psychic who died in 1945. <PERSON> Cayce </PERSON> taught that the secrets of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> and knowledge of the future are buried under the right front paw of the Sphinx at the foot of <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>. In addition to Americans, theme cruises are organized in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and growing numbers of Japanese tours come to <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> especially to `` tap pyramid power,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. `` This pyramid power stuff is really big,'' he said. `` People want to believe in magic, and big structures give an air of magic. I'm sure if I called myself the Pyramid Prophet I could have a following larger than the most famous Indian guru.'' Built about 4,600 years ago, the pyramids remain enigmas to scientists as well as to seekers of the unknown. The first person to enter the Great Pyramid of <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> in post-pharaonic times was the caliph of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> al-Ma ` mun, in 820 He forced his way in by heating rocks, then breaking them by pouring on vinegar. As generations of scientists and tourists, eccentrics and treasure hunters followed him, pyramid mystique grew over the ages. Perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the occult was <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON>, who spent the night of Aug. 12, 1799, inside <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>' pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken. He went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced. `` No! What's the use,'' <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> was said to have told a friend. `` You would n't believe me anyway.'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said many people, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have ideas and theories about the <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> pyramids, particularly <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>' Great Pyramid `` They read that <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> is made of 2.3 million blocks, each one weighing 2 -LCB- tons to 15 tons, each side at an angle of 51 degrees, 50 minutes and 35 seconds,'' he said. `` They think nobody on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> could have built this. That the pyramids were built by people from outer space, or survivors from the lost continent of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>. `` They never look at what's attached to the pyramids, the structures, the organization necessary to build them, the cult of the king.'' He said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` but fewer than half a dozen contain any science of value.'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in Egyptology from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> and has lectured throughout <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about the pyramids, said he'd never heard of pyramid power until he went there in 1977. `` I was speaking to an audience in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and as I began to talk everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his head. I asked, ` What are you doing?,' and they explained about power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid. `` OK. I try to be open-minded. When I returned, I tried some experiments.'' The first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve bodies. `` I bought some meat and put part of it in my office, part inside <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>. The meat inside my office lasted longer than inside the pyramid. That was one -LRB- myth -RRB- down. `` If the ancient Egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by placing a corpse under a pyramid, then why did they invent mummification?''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is spending upwards of $ 20 million on what may become the mutual fund industry's equivalent of the supermarket coupon or the cut-rate auto loan. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of the prominent money-management firm since 1965, hopes the investment will pay big dividends for <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> among a giant new generation of investors. The money is going to cover the management fee and expenses, normally collected from the fund itself, of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, which began operations last Feb. 27. With its sponsor picking up the costs, the Worldwide Dollar fund has predictably ranked among the highest-yielding money market funds ever since. As of last Wednesday its seven-day yield, reported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, stood at 9.13 percent, compared to an industry average of 8.21 percent. Though it has long been common practice for sponsors of new funds to charge no fees during the launching period, nobody before has taken the idea quite so far. <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> has promised to keep paying the costs at least until Dec. 25 or the point when the fund's assets, which recently surpassed $ 3 billion, reach $ 3.5 billion. At that stage, the firm has said, it will consider extending the cutoff point further. Some skeptical financial advisers have cautioned that this is a gimmick _ an enticement to attract people into a fund whose yield is likely to drop back into the pack once Dreyfus phases out the incentives, as it surely must if it is ever going to make any money from the venture. But <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, in an interview in his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment a half a block from Central Park, says there is a distinct purpose behind the strategy. The target, he says, is `` a different group of investors, the younger group that's just beginning to save. They have been brought up on sales everywhere.'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> seems pleased with the results to date. <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> has just adopted a similar `` no cost'' incentive for a fund investing in tax-exempt municipal securities, and plans to use it with some other funds as well, he says. After its explosive growth with many new products in the 1980s, <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> says, the mutual fund business is becoming `` a mature industry. But we are seeing growth in another area.'' At a time when the baby boom generation is approaching the age when people traditionally increase their savings and investment activity, he observes, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are debating new measures to increase savings _ for example, a restoration of the tax break for long-term capital gains. `` We're looking at a national desire to save and new incentives to save coming down the road in the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> says. No matter how much emphasis the country places on such things, however, he believes the free-wheeling, deregulated atmosphere of the financial world in the 1980s is going to change. `` I expect to see a lot more surveillance and restraints, and that's all to the good,'' he says. `` A lack of surveillance is not a long-term positive. When people are not watching, somebody will take a chance.'' For example, he says, after the boom in debt-financed takeovers and buyouts of the past several years, `` there is a distinct possibility of a junk-bond episode that will affect the marketplace.'' `` Conditions are going to be forced to be addressed,'' he adds. The circumstances that bring on change may be painful, he acknowledges, `` but the more painful the process, the more the system will be cleansed.''

<HEAD>Chapman, Etheridge Try To Defy Sophomore Jinx With New Albums</HEAD>

 When <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> recorded followups to their popular debut albums this year, they turned to the same producers, same musicians and, in <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s case, even the same microphone used the first time around It remains to be seen, of course, if they can duplicate the success. Answers will come soon. <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON>'s `` Brave and Crazy'' was released in mid-September and <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s `` Crossroads'' followed a few weeks later. They'll be trying to defy one of the music business' toughest obstacles _ the sophomore jinx. Music history is replete with artists who crumbled under the high expectations caused by successful debut albums. Remember the Knack? Others who fell victim to the jinx include <ORGANIZATION> Christopher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loaf </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The Grammy Award-winning <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> burst onto the scene last year, selling 3 million copies of a folk album filled with gentle love songs and pointed political barbs. In contrast to <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, whose album was an instant, precedent-shattering success, <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> started slowly. But her album of smoldering rock tunes reached gold status -LRB- 500,000 sales -RRB- when word spread of her bracing live performances. <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> seemed to sum up the approach of both artists to their sophomore efforts when she talked of her already-recorded new album during an April interview. `` There's nothing outrageously different,'' she said. `` It's just the next step Technically, musically, it's the same thing.'' <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON>'s manager, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON>, would n't allow her to be interviewed this fall about the new album, both because he did n't want her to be mentioned in the same article with another female artist and nervousness over the sophomore effort, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowatka </PERSON>, a publicist at <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> Paranoia is a frequent response to second album pressures. Artists can tie their stomachs in knots worrying about which way to turn. Should they use the same approach as the first album and hear accusations that they're repeating themselves or change styles and risk alienating the people who made them a success? `` Both of those thoughts occurred to me,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kershenbaum </PERSON>, who co-produced `` Crossroads'' with <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` What it was on the first album was basically her and her guitar with us filling in the blanks,'' <PERSON> Kershenbaum </PERSON> said. `` That's what we did on this new record We did n't do any more and we did n't do any less Even though we did n't consciously try, the record turned out differently.'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> also would n't talk about the new record, but her sudden fame is clearly on her mind. The title cut of `` Crossroads'' talks about pressures she faced to `` sell your soul'' and concludes with the admonition, `` All you demons go back to hell.'' `` She was very clear when she came in and very strong,'' <PERSON> Kershenbaum </PERSON> said. `` I did n't detect any insecurity at all, nowhere near what could have been with the pressure of a followup record like this.'' That was n't the case with some of the musicians, who were a little nervous, he said. Musicians <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Fongheiser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON> all make return appearances backing <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. New guests include <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, `` Saturday Night Live'' guitarist G.E. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and former <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> violinist <PERSON> Scarlet </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> used some new guitars, but asked for the same microphone to duplicate vocals from her debut. The mix of personal and world politics on `` Crossroads'' is roughly the same as on the first record. `` Freedom Now'' is about jailed South African leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and `` Material World'' is bitter in its denunciation of upwardly mobile people who forget their roots. Both <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> seem to have stockpiled material to tide them over in case of writer's block. Some of the publishing credits on <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s songs date to 1982 and 1984, while <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> has been performing several of the `` Brave and Crazy'' songs for more than a year. Expectations seem to differ slightly for both records. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s record is out in time for the Christmas buying season, but her record company seems to be positioning <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> as an artist of longevity, such as <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grein </PERSON>, author of Billboard magazine's `` Chart Beat'' column. It's also significant that the record is out 15 months after the debut, he said. Anticipation for `` Crossroads'' is `` not as high as it would be if she had waited longer,'' <PERSON> Grein </PERSON> said. `` It would have put more pressure on her. She was smart to come fairly quickly and get the followup out of the way.'' <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON>'s management, by contrast, seems poised to make the Kansas-born artist a star. The single `` No Souvenirs'' came out a month in advance of the album to whet the audience's appetite, and <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> is booked for five nights later this month at the Bottom Line, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s industry showcase club. `` She's positioned very well,'' <PERSON> Grein </PERSON> said. `` The first album did well and got a great critical reaction but was n't a home run. I think she's in a good position to go further with this album.'' Such songs as `` No Souvenirs,'' `` The Angels'' and `` Skin Deep'' have sweeping rock hooks well designed for frequent radio airplay. <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> is still sifting through the shards of shattered relationships for her best material, but the new record is harder rocking, less downbeat than the first. Again, her acoustic guitar _ which is attacked more often than strummed _ is at the center of her band's sound. <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> produced the record with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Niko </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolas </PERSON>, just like the debut. <PERSON> Kershenbaum </PERSON>, whose own career has blossomed with interest in the minimalist style he and <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> used on the first album, is philosophic about the sophomore pressure. `` A lot of people are going to be very interested in seeing how the second album does. Did she beat it? Does it sound the same? Was she lucky the first time?'' he said. `` What happens with a record like that, when we have that much exposure, is that we come to bat in a really heavy posture on the next one. `` If we did our job well and people like our songs, then that's going to help us If they do n't like the songs, then no matter what we did, it's not going to mean anything.''

<HEAD>Results of Education Summit, If Any, Won't Show for Long Time</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The true test of a summit conference is what happens on the way down. That's especially so for pseudo-summits, called to deal with problems at home rather than to put leaders of world powers across the table from one another. So the grades for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education summit with the governors will not be in until next semester. And the results wo n't show for a long time after that `` From this day forward, let us be an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of tougher standards, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of higher goals and a land of bigger dreams,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after conferring with the governors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>. They agreed that there should be national standards by which to judge the performance of schools and their students. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told the governors he would seek the added flexibility they want in the use of federal education aid. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, a leading spokesman on education, said the success of the summit can be judged on the basis of public response to the national goals, and ultimately, `` on whether students learn more.'' That's the point, of course. With or without national standards, it is obvious that too many students are not learning enough now, with a school dropout rate of nearly 30 percent and with an estimated 23 million illiterate adults. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are ready for radical reforms'' in education. The changes envisioned in the summit sumup did n't sound radical. They included holding educators accountable for student performance, keeping drugs out of schools, cutting away federal and state educational red tape, reducing the dropout rate and improving literacy. The post-summit challenge can hardly be to those common sense goals. It will be to keep education reform high on the national agenda. That wo n't be free, although the president and the governors carefully avoided debates about more federal spending. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said there would have to be more spending later, but the goals came first. `` You ca n't do it with poetry,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He and <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> are among 28 Democratic governors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has no budget room to spare anyhow, said the focus should be on results, not resources. `` If anything, hard experience teaches that we are simply not getting our money's worth in education,'' he said. The administration estimates that local, state and federal education spending this year will total $ 353 billion. Secretary of Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said that is an increase of 24 percent since 1983. He said about 6 percent of the total is spent from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The education summit itself was a symbol. To underscore <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s concern about education, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> compared it to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s meeting with governors in 1933, when he summoned them to talk about Depression measures Nowadays, conferring at the summit _ a phrase attributed to <LOCATION> Winston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> _ has become a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cliche. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was presiding at the education conference Wednesday and Thursday, the deficit deal struck at a budget summit last spring was fraying in a congressional struggle over taxes and spending. As a presidential candidate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of five different summit meetings, on five different sets of problems. When <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> proposed a Cold War summit parley, he meant a meeting among the chiefs of state. That kind of summit has become a fixture of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> diplomacy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are to hold their first one late next spring or early in the summer. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held five summit meetings with Soviet leaders. That kind of summitry puts faces and personalities behind the cold issues and hard lines of East-West rivalries. While summit meetings have eased tensions, delivered treaties and spurred arms control, they do n't always work. There were those who said that <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s misreading of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> at their 1961 summit led to the miscalculations that produced the Cuban missile crisis. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> created what was called `` the spirit of Camp David,'' but it did n't last Within the year, the U-2 spy plane episode led <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to angrily cancel a 1959 summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Agreements signed at diplomatic summits are written on the way up, not at the top. That's not the case at a domestic summit like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with the governors. There, scripts have to be written during the drama of the summit itself. So their agreements tend to be broad ones, with details to be filled in later. But atmosphere is important, too. The education summit delivered a sense of commitment, urgency and determination to deal with a deepening national problem. That's not an answer, but it's a beginning.

 The images of war wrought by Hurricane Hugo conjured up memories of another devastating time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> history when the carcasses of houses dotted the landscape and the weary mourned for more than their dead. `` I feel like my forefathers must have felt at the close of the War Between the States. I think we lost life as we know it,'' said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, a councilman in neighboring <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` Our economy has been laid waste. Our land has been laid waste. We're all emotionally scarred,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. This time, the villain was n't an invading army, although <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> has suffered its share of natural disaster in its glorious 319-year history. This time a way of life was gone with a wind named <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, a killer that roared across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and struck a bulls-eye on <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> before it fizzled off the weather radar screens as a low-pressure system in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The hurricane and its remnants killed 33 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and 29 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 18 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The 12th strongest hurricane to hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland in this century, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> caused an estimated $ 3 billion damage in this state alone. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, a jewel of the Old South now with 65,000 residents, has weathered much since it was founded in 1670. The British occupied it in the Revolutionary War; the Union bombarded it in the Civil War. The city survived a disastrous fire in 1861 and earthquakes in 1886 and 1893. Now it can add <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> to its battle flag. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired by the first state to secede from the Union, fell not to Confederate cannons but to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s tidal surge. It was swamped by a 17-foot wave, sustained $ 1 million damage and is under repair. `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> just wo n't ever be the same. When the hurricane hit, it took a piece of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> with it,'' said <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lappe </PERSON>, 30. `` It looked like a bomb had been dropped. If you ride in the streets, it makes you want to cry.'' In all, 63 buildings in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> collapsed and 381 have severe structural damage, officials said. Four of five structures have roof damage of some degree. Some buildings in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> date back to the 1690s. Its historic district sits on a peninsula that sticks out like a tongue into its harbor, where a fictional <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> ran the Union blockade. About 75 percent of the city's 3,500 building considered to be of historical significance were damaged, including 20 to 30 that were severely damaged or razed. Then as the second part of a cruel combination punch, the structures were hit by several inches of rain two days after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left. Damage to those buildings was put in the hundreds of millions of dollars and could take five years to repair, according to teams of preservationists who rushed to the city's aid from all over the country. `` We're not destroyed, but we're hurt,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, grateful that the pastel-colored antebellum mansions were n't subjected to more ruin. The mahogany altar at the Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was splintered by a stone roof support that crashed down when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> gouged a gaping hole in the roof of the Roman revival structure built in 1815. `` At least the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> are n't shooting at us this time,'' said the Very Rev. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Koscheski </PERSON>. As in any battle, there were heroes. In <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION>, a shrimping village of 500 residents in the <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lowcountry </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> unleashed its mightiest tidal surge of 20 feet. The entire town was devastated. Boats 68 feet long were tossed into yards as if they were toys. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Colleton </PERSON>, 57, hoisted his family of nine up to the inner rafters of his one-story house as waters flooded in and rose up to his chest as he lifted the children. `` I wanted to be the last one -LRB- up -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Colleton </PERSON> said later. `` When you hear a man screaming for help and nobody can help him, you know it's terrible.'' `` Lives are just devastated,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 45, as he scraped the muck from his home. `` It's really gone with the wind this time. Literally. There's nothing to do but pick up the pieces and start over.'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 74, stacked her furniture and furnishings on the front lawn in an attempt to dry them. Water had surged 10 feet into the house. A building she had never seen before was dumped in the back yard. `` It was absolute pandemonium,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said `` We may be scrounging around for food just like <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. We just do n't know where to turn. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> issued an emergency ordinance to prevent price gouging on items such as ice and chain saws. A fist fight broke out in one ice line. Some looting was also reported in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` It's like stealing from a graveyard,'' shopowner <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said. But for the most part, people quietly picked up the pieces. The National Guard enforced a dawn-to-dusk curfew and martial law was imposed on the Isle of Palms, one of the barrier islands that absorbed the brunt of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s ferocity. After getting his first look at the devastation, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer, said, `` It looks like what happens after artillery fire.'' Some island and coastal residents who may have lost everything they had to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> faced another devastating prospect: a state law enacted to curb beach erosion may prevent some from rebuilding. And more than a week after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> roared through, 203,000 people were without power, most of them in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area. Storm-battered residents coped without electricity, without hot water for showers, without ways to cook hot food as convoys of electrical workers strung new power lines. They queued up for meals, canned food, ice, air mattresses, gas lanterns, shoes and clothes at distribution points. `` This will keep us alive,'' said a grateful <PERSON> Fesella </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladson </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, carrying a cardboard box filled with emergency supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> mounted a $ 42 million relief effort, the most expensive relief effort in its 126-year history. Supplies poured in from around the country, but folks in the rural areas felt the recovery moved glacier-like. Mayor <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Parson-Starkes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ridgeville </LOCATION> blamed <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> for `` the worst devastation in any of our lives.'' `` We have no food, water, power or anything. We're pleading for all the help we can get. I just do n't know how we're going to get through this.'' <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s fury recalled the age-old awe of Caribbean Indians who bowed before a god of wind named Hurrican. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, its brute energy created incongruous scenes: boats blown a half-mile inland, roofs sheared off, trees twisted into spaghetti-like heaps. `` It really rattled us to our roots,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. Somehow, people began rebuilding their homes and their lives. Some in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> found a force more indomitable than the guns of armies or nature's mightiest forces. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> waited patiently for a leasing company to put the roof back on her business, Terrible <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s Pastry Shop. She hoped to reopen soon. `` It's the spirit of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We're survivors.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it has reached a `` watershed'' in its financial health with a debt restructuring that gives the entertainment company more money, lower interest costs and fewer restrictions. <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON>, The Movie Channel and distribution rights to `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Roseanne'' and `` A Different World'' as well as 14 cable TV systems, five television stations and eight radio stations. <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION> is 83 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amusements </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, movie theater chain that bought its stake for $ 460 million in cash and $ 2.8 billion in new and old debt in a leveraged buyout in 1987. The New York-based company said Thursday the refinancing was made possible by an increase in the value of its assets and the flow of cash from its operations, marking the success of the buyout. The 10-year agreement with its bank lenders, led by <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> as co-agent, gives it up to $ 1.5 billion in unsecured bank loans and revolving credit.

 A major toy retailer is voluntarily recalling 11,000 baby rattles because parts of the toy may become detached and choke young children, a government agency said. The `` Wooden Shaky Head Rattles'' were sold nationwide for about $ 2 each in 1988 and 1989 by Toys ` R' Us, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The toy consists of a six and one-half inch wooden handle topped with a red, yellow, pink or black head-shaped rattle which has springs hanging from each side.

The rattle `` fails to meet the Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> mandatory standard for rattles that is intended to prevent choking accidents involving young children,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the panel's acting chairwoman, said Thursday.

The nature of the discussions was not disclosed and prosecutors and defense lawyers on Thursday declined to discuss their content. But the tapes could emerge as critical evidence in the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s scheduled March 1990 trial on fraud and racketeering charges The tape recordings, made on Oct. 1, Oct. 9 and Nov. 6, 1986, were mentioned in a letter from the government to lawyers representing <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. The letter was attached to a recent filing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The final recorded conversation occurred just eight days before the revelation that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> made a deal to cooperate with prosecutors in their probe of Wall Street corruption. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the former head of junk bond operations for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted in March on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering for an alleged series of schemes with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in November 1986 agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count of filing false information with the government and is serving a three-year jail term. His stock dealings with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> formed the basis of much of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s indictment, principally a $ 5.3 million payment from <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to settle the balance in what the government calls a secret arrangement involving insider trading, tax fraud, rigged corporate takeovers and other violations. It was known that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> secretly tape-recorded conversations after he was recruited as an informant but the identities of those he tape-recorded had not been disclosed previously. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was first implicated in the spring of 1986 by investment banker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors some time that summer. If the tapes contain damaging information about <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, they could strengthen the government's case. But if <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said nothing incriminating despite attempts by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to trap him, it could help the defense. Tape recordings were not mentioned in the government's indictment of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and two others The government has said a broader indictment is expected in the next month. The April 24 letter detailing the tapes was attached to a recent filing by the government as part of the discovery process in the case, in which prosecutors are required to inform the defense of documents and other evidence gathered. The letter said the Oct. 9 conversation was recorded on two cassettes while the others were recorded on one tape. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> declined to discuss the tapes. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said in a statement released by a spokesman for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>: `` As we've said in the past, we will not try this case in the press, and we look forward to a full hearing in court.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen during morning trading Friday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> edged up slightly. The dollar was changing hands at 139.50 yen, down 1.35 yen from Thursday's close of 140.85 yen, at late morning. After opening lower at 140.60 yen, the currency ranged from 139.20 to 140.75 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose 319.41 points Thursday, added 19.86 points, or 0.05 percent, closing the morning session at 35,709.84, a new high. Currency dealers said the dollar was pushed further down by coordinated intervention by the Japanese, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British central banks. It was the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s fifth consecutive day of intervention in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market. The intervention began Monday, when central banks from other nations stepped into the market to join in bringing the dollar down, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> does not comment on its intervention policy, but it was reported to have sold $ 200 million during Friday's morning trading, according to <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Central bank intervention also has taken place on overseas markets following Saturday's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized countries.

<TEXT>
 Plans for increased cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in space exploration could be a boon to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fledgling aerospace industries, analysts say. During a six-day visit to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that ended Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made space cooperation a top priority in forging a `` global partnership'' with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, beginning with the international `` Freedom'' space station and a project to measure effects of solar radiation on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s magnetic field. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said both sides were considering possible Japanese collaboration in a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative for space exploration that would put a permanent observatory on the moon and send a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Japanese leaders welcomed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enthusiastic support for international cooperation in space, a rare area in which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lags far behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in terms of both technology and spending. Partly due to prohibitions imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after World War II, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a latecomer to the aerospace field. It has relied heavily on foreign technology and, while active in development of rockets and satellites, has no independent manned space program. This summer, as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, began mapping out a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> era in space, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was drafting a 10-year space program to develop an unmanned space plane in the next decade and eventually to send its own astronauts into space aboard Japanese-made spacecraft. The program also calls for basic research on robots capable of assembling and repairing satellites in orbit and for developing a rocket capable of lifting commercial payloads into orbit. Constitutional limits on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military, which have slowed defense-related research, and low government spending have been major handicaps for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s space program. Concerned that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restrictions on security-sensitive and advanced technology could close the technology pipeline, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has begun channeling more funds into space research, although spending remains far below that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1989, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is spending $ 1.1 billion on its space programs, compared with $ 9 billion dollars spent by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> alone in 1988. Without a substantial increase in commercial spinoffs from military and other government-sponsored space research, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is unlikely, however, to develop a profitable, competitive space program in the foreseeable future, says <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Jardine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` The Japanese space industry is tiny. In terms of actual potential I do n't see the emergence of an independent and commercially viable aerospace industry anytime soon,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said during his visit to the Tsukuba Space Center east of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that instead of fearing competition from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in space, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hoped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could help defray the huge cost of space exploration. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not buying enough American-made satellites should not interfere with overall cooperation in space science. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faces possible retaliation under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Super 301'' trade legislation if it is judged to be unfairly discriminating against the U.S.-made satellites. While <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would like to have a strong space industry, it is more likely to join international programs that dilute risk while facilitating technology transfers. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants to have its own indigenous technology, but the risks involved in space development are enormous,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Aerospace could become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s only truly international industry, says analyst <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capel </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` In the past all -LRB- Japanese -RRB- manufacturing was originally domestic, and that created trade problems,'' said <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> `` wants to use aerospace to internationalize <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. To international projects, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can contribute superior electronics technology, particularly in radar and visual imaging as well as the powerful computer chips needed in sophisticated aerospace equipment, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is trying to develop its own industry for commercial launches of satellites, a step that requires upgrading old technology borrowed from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to develop a rocket able to launch heavier payloads. Its payloads for a geostationary orbit currently are limited to 1,200 pounds. To be competitive, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must have a rocket capable of handling at least 2,000 pounds. But Japanese researchers have run into technical problems that have delayed the launch of the next generation H-2 rocket by at least one year, officials say. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also needs to find another location for satellite launches, says <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>. Its equivalent of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Tanegashima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on a small island off the southern coast. The <LOCATION> Tanegashima </LOCATION> facility has been expanded to accommodate the H-2 rocket program, but an agreement with local fishermen restricts launches to a 45-day period in the summer and another 45-day period in the winter, limiting both experimental progress and future commercial launches.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Launches New Low-Smoke Cigarette</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who worry about irritating non-smokers with their cigarettes are targets for the latest tobacco product from <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. The nation's largest cigarette maker announced the national launch Thursday of a cigarette that it says emits 70 percent less smoke from the lighted end than most comparable brands. The cigarette, called Superslims from <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slims </ORGANIZATION>, also is very low in tar and slimmer in shape than most other 100 millimeter cigarettes, the company said. The principal buyers are expected to be women. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, maker of the Marlboro, <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> and Merit brands, already is the leader in the estimated $ 40 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette market with an estimated 41 percent market share. But overall cigarette sales have been declining at about a 2.5 percent rate for several years. Industry analysts said the new cigarette continues that market's trend of offering products that appeal to narrowly defined groups _ in this case women and people concerned about offending non-smokers with their cigarettes `` This is a business based on segmentation,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who follows the tobacco business for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Cutting down on so-called `` sidestream'' smoke has become a more important concern to cigarette makers who face an increasingly hostile regulatory environment. Superslims emit less smoke from the lit end than most other brands because of a double wrapping of porous and non-porous papers, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. The wrapping does not affect the amount of smoke which the smoker inhales, however. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E.R </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dangoor </PERSON>, vice president for marketing at <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, said the low-smoke feature was something `` a lot of smokers will find to be an advantage'' as social pressures continue to build against smoking. But he said <PERSON> Superslims </PERSON>' main attraction is that it combines in one cigarette all three features _ low smoke, low tar and extra slimness _ that are currently found only individually in other brands. <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, since early this year has been testing Vantage Excel 100s, which it says emits less smoke from the lit end than other 100-millimeter cigarettes. A number of cigarette brands, including <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lights </ORGANIZATION>, match or have lower levels of tar than the 6 milligrams in Superslims. And Brown & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another leading tobacco company, has been selling an extra slim brand called Capri since 1987. It filed a patent infringement suit against <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> last May in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> in an effort to head off the introduction of Superslims. The suit is pending. Both Capri and <PERSON> Superslims </PERSON> have a circumference of 17 millimeters compared with 23 millimeters for <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Slims and 25 millimeters for regular brands. Cigarette companies frequently test new brands in a few markets before launching them nationally, but <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was bypassing the test market because of the positive reaction women smokers had to Superslims in interviews <PERSON> Dangoor </PERSON> refused to say how much <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> planned to spend marketing the cigarettes, but said it would be an `` extremely ambitious'' mix of print, outdoor and point-of-purchase ads, couponing, direct mail and promotions. In one ad planned for magazines next month, two pairs of women's fingers are shown holding burning cigarettes _ one pair holds one of the `` leading 100s'' emiting a heavy curl of smoke while the other holds a Superslims with only a wisp of smoke <PERSON> Dangoor </PERSON> said the new cigarettes are totally unrelated to the so-called smokeless cigarette called Premier which <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> discontinued earlier this year after a disastrous run of several months in test markets. Premier used a burning carbon element to heat tobacco without burning it. `` This is a real cigarette that burns tobacco,'' <PERSON> Dangoor </PERSON> said of Superslims.

<HEAD>Sony Agrees to Buy Guber-Peters Entertainment, May Find Role at Columbia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy the moviemaker <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and indicated its owners would be offered roles at another prospective <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> operation, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it agreed to pay $ 17.50 a share, or $ 200 million, for <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> company headed by producers <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> that counts the movie hits `` Batman'' and `` Rain Man'' among its Including Guber-Peters' debt that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> will inherit, the deal is valued at $ 240 million. The move came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese electronics giant, took its biggest step into the `` software'' side of the entertainment business by agreeing to pay $ 3.4 billion for New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. A potential snag to the deal developed Thursday, however, when three <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> shareholders filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> attempting to block the takeover. The suit, filed by shareholders <PERSON> Elfriede </PERSON> <PERSON> Glancy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Zupnick </PERSON>, accused <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors of settling for an offer from <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> that was far less than what the company is worth. It asks that the board be ordered to cooperate with others seeking to buy the company. A <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugiyama </PERSON>, said the suit was a matter between <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and its shareholders and that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> had no other comment. The purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> dramatizes <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s eagerness to shore up <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s floundering film production. Guber-Peters has a tangible net worth of just $ 2 a share, according to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennenbaum </PERSON>, vice chairman of investment banking for Bear, <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which appraised the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> board. But the company has much greater intrinsic value, <PERSON> Tennenbaum </PERSON> said, because of its television assets, future profit payoffs from `` Batman'' and, most important, because of its `` management and track record.'' <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> are considered to be two of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s hottest producers. In announcing that its board agreed to the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said its president and chief executive, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, and its chief operating officer, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON>, had indicated they intended to `` move on to other endeavors'' before any deal was completed. There have been published reports that <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> would be asked to replace <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> once the acquisition is completed. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> failed to respond to repeated requests for comment. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulhof </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, also declined to comment directly on those reports Thursday. But he said in a telephone interview, `` We are hopeful that the management of <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> will work out some of their existing contractual arrangements in a way that will make it possible for them to join <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> recently renewed a five-year production contract with <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, and are working on a `` Batman'' sequel due in 1991 and film adaptations of the books `` Bonfire of the Vanities'' and `` A Bright Shining Lie'' for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Rights to those films are owned by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, and it is conceivable that Guber-Peters might still make them for the rival studio. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> would benefit by receiving a share of the film's profits through Guber-Peters A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, declined comment on the contracts with <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. The two producers have worked together for years and industry executives said it was unlikely that one of them would take a role at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> without the other. Two years ago, <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> merged their privately-held production company with <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which made `` The Gong Show,'' among other TV programs. In the fiscal year ended May 31, <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 19.2 million on revenue of $ 23.7 million. The company has yet to realize any profits from either the Academy Award-winning `` Rain Man'' or `` Batman,'' one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s most successful films. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> said it intended to begin a tender offer for all of <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION>' shares next week. That is also when it intends to begin its tender offer of $ 27 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. Also on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> reported it earned $ 13.0 million, or 10 cents a share, in the three months ended Aug. 31, up from 6.2 million, or 4 cents a share a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue rose to $ 453.4 million from $ 373.1 million a year earlier. For the first six months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 15.0 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $ 10.5 million, or 7 cents a share, a year earlier. Six month revenue rose to $ 804.5 million from $ 783.6 million.

 Something is happening to herbs. They're no longer just for gourmet cooks and snooty restaurants, says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. From the well-known garlic clove to jasmine and foxglove, herbs are used for such diverse purposes as cooking, landscaping, bridal wreaths and aromatherapy. According to recently released 1987 census of agriculture estimates, there has been a dramatic increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> herb farming, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. The acreage rose 122 percent between 1982 and 1987 and the quantity harvested jumped 248 percent. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, writing in the October issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said food service and retail suppliers are enlarging their herb-growing operations and are building new high-tech packing houses to handle the crops. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has more than doubled its membership from 450 only three years ago to 1,050 today. But <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who works for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, added Thursday in a telephone interview that no, herbs are n't about to crowd wheat and soybeans off the charts, at least not yet. Aromatherapy is something new in the scent world. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said it's hard to define satisfactorily, but it has to do with fragrances affecting human well-being and attitudes. Something like that. `` We know that use of fresh culinary herbs has skyrocketed,'' she said. `` But right now there's no way to get a good estimate of their total value.'' Why the herb surge? One reason is the availability. Herbs garnish produce counters virtually in every supermarket. `` Instead of having to go to a restaurant and having them served to you, where they have made special arrangements to get herbs, having them available at grocery stores has made a difference,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. Sometimes herbs can be marketed through several channels. For example, both fresh and dried rosemary is available at some supermarkets. And it's also sold as a potted plant at herb garden nurseries. Farm markets often carry rosemary wreaths during the winter. Garlic is also sold for cooking, as a dietary supplement, and is braided with dried flowers for sale as decorations by upscale kitchen boutiques and farmers' markets. It's supposed to ward off vampires, too. <PERSON> Feverfew </PERSON> is used in herbal landscaping design, and some medical reports suggest it may be effective in preventing migraine headaches. Other examples cited by <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> include jasmine, which is used in teas as well as high-grade perfumes, and foxglove used as an ornamental plant and in the cardiovascular drug digitalis. According to a 1989 consumer survey by The <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, an industry publication, the top five fresh herbs in consumer recognition are garlic, 95 percent of those questioned; parsley, 86 percent; dill, 67 percent; chives, 66 percent; and ginger root, 59 percent. More than half of those surveyed had seen or heard of fresh basil, while a third or more had seen or heard of fresh mint, horseradish, oregano, sage, thyme, rosemary and anise. Twenty-seven percent recognized cilantro and marjoram. Herb-growing operations range from hobby farmers and back yard nurseries in cities to open-air farms with more than several hundred acres. According to the 1987 agricultural census, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leads in garlic and parsley acreage, while <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer of ginger root. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state leads in dill acreage, and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> has the most mint. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is also the top producer of `` all other'' herbs, a category that includes fresh culinary herbs such as basil, chives, thyme and rosemary. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is the largest producer of herbs in an `` aggregate'' category, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. Most of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s herb acreage, however, is for cultivated ginseng, not for culinary herbs. Most of the crop is exported to <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, where ginseng is used as a medicine. Meanwhile, imports of fresh herbs are also up, she said. These shipments are used both for fresh market sales and in food processing. Total imports of 17 herbs shipped fresh to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> increased to 14 million pounds in 1987, up 6 percent from 1986 and 22 percent more than in 1985. The largest imports, in order, were garlic, cilantro, ginger root, oregano and parsley.

<HEAD>Exchange Officials Testify on Market Reform Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Proposed market reform legislation to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has met with at least partial approval from the nation's top stock market officials. The presidents of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday that they favored most or all of the four key points proposed in the Stock Market Reform Act of 1989. Also testifying before the subcommittee was the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, who said introduction of a hand-held computer to record trades on the nation's two largest futures exchanges is at least a year away. <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> said the exchange and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> were spending `` $ 5 million just for development'' of the computerized record-keeping system, proposed in the wake of a wave of indictments for alleged massive fraud schemes by traders and brokers on both futures exchanges. The market reform bill was proposed in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average dropped more than 500 points. It would grant the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority to halt securities trading for up to 24 hours in an emergency situation, described as `` a major market disturbance.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> and Amex President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON> approved of that idea, but the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> said he opposed trading halts. `` As a general principle, we think that markets should strive to remain open under all market conditions, to provide the liquidity and price discovery on which individual and institutional investors rely,'' he said in a prepared statement that accompanied his tesimony. `` The fact that the markets remained open and functioning, although not perfectly, during the market break of October 1987 probably averted a much more serious financial crisis,'' continued the statement by the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the over-the-counter stock market. <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> joined the two exchange officials in supporting another aspect of the bill that called for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to link or coordinate their facilities for clearing and settling trades in securities, options, futures contracts and other transactions. But <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> said he also had questions about two other points of the bill: new requirements for reporting large stock trades and rules for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies that are the parent companies of broker-dealers. The others disagreed with him, however, when Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. asked, `` Should we be concerned about the stability of securities firms which have accepted large bridge loans?'' Traditionally, a bridge loan is a short-term loan in anticipation of long-term financing. But in the recent wave of leveraged buyouts, mergers and takeovers, investment banks that make bridge loans frequently cover their own risk exposure by selling high-yield junk bonds. The junk bond market, weakened by the credit troubles of Canadian retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last week, has scared off investors and raised concerns on Capitol Hill that would stick Wall Street investment banks with big loans they might have trouble refinancing. In light of published reports of losses of as much as $ 20 million to $ 30 million in the junk bond market, <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> told <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think it's an area that is well worth our continuing focus and certainly from the point of view measuring the ability to assess risk, it is absolutely critical that we have that we have that provision in your bill.'' <PERSON> Liebler </PERSON> agreed, saying `` there may well be situations in which the financial viability of a broker-dealer can not be fully gauged without'' such a risk assessment.

Four other top executives also resigned. `` I suspect that Mr. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> was surprised by the resignations,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON> said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> was informed Wednesday of the resignations, which will take effect Oct. 15. Before Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor had repeatedly said he wanted <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> to continue as chairman. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> named <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> as president to replace president and chief operating officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> will split the chief executive duties previously handled by <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON> said. Also resigning from the airline were <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pray </PERSON>, executive vice president-international, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitter </PERSON>, executive vice president-administration and chief information officer. None could be reached for comment Thursday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, former president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, was named executive vice president and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> companies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, MLT Vacations and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm getting reports from membership that it's a pretty positive move,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, the carrier's largest union. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said any rift between <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> could include differing views of labor. He said <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> inherited a byzantine outlook from predecessors <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyrop </PERSON> and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapensky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nyrop </PERSON> is legendary for removing doors from the toilet stalls in the employee wash rooms at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to discourage lengthy bathroom breaks. `` I think <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has given clear indications that he wishes to change the direction of management-labor relations,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the local unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he had expected <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>'s team to stay in place up to a year after the buyout. But he, too, welcomed new management. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who is reviewing the buyout, had no warning of the resignations, <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON> said. He said it was too early to tell what impact the change will have on <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s review. <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON> said there was no indication that <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s chairmanship would be temporary Management by <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> `` would definitely be hands-on,'' he added. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the split was inevitable because <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> was accustomed to reporting to a docile board of directors. Since June, <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has had to answer to <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive who also worked as a dealmaker for the Bass brothers of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` When you have two very strong-willed egos butting heads at that level, you know it wo n't last long,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Neither <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> has airline experience, but both worked for <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, which has close ties to the industry. In addition, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was a finalist in December 1987 for the top job at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a merchant banker from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, also worked on the staff of former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and was an investor in <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s buyout group. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, said the change at <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> was necessary to improve the company's `` prickly labor-management relations. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> oversaw the 1986 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and led management's fight against a hostile takeover bid of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> launched early this year by oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The takeover battled ended in June when <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s group completed its all-cash buyout of the carrier for $ 121 a share. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said at the time that he considered <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>'s group to be friendly.

 Stock prices were lower at midday Friday, but the expiration of stock-index futures and options lifted the market from its lowest levels. Shares got off to a weak start as fears swept the market that the British government would raise interest rates to shore up the sagging pound. But prices steadied as market jitters calmed down by midmorning. Traders breathed a sign of relief once the quarterly futures and options contracts expired, dealers said. At midday, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was down 7.2 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,284.5. Volume was a moderate 271.1 million shares by midday, compared with 215.6 million shares at the same time Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics concern, will be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a stock-swap deal valued at $ 561 million, company officials said. The deal, which will give control of <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, Japan-based <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION>, will have little affect on <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operations. <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said Thursday that `` it is the intention of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to operate as we are today.'' The move is being called one of the first between an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Japanese company strictly involving stock. The news sent <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION>'s stock surging $ 8 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, where it closed at $ 29.62 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> manufactures passive electronic components called capacitors for the military, aerospace and telecommunications fields and had sales of roughly $ 409 million in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> makes technical ceramics for semi-conductors, optical instruments and electronic equipment and had more than $ 2.5 billion in sales during the fiscal year ending March 31. Analysts said the merger was part of streamlining in the technology industry. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of Interstate <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said the deal could give <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> enough financial backing to expand local facilities. <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> had purchased four competitors in less than two years of expansion moves. About half of <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION>'s business is conducted overseas, and the merger enhances its global position, company chairman <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Inamori </PERSON> said in a news release. Under terms of the deal, each share of <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> would be exchanged for 0.39 Kyocera American depositary receipts. The ADRs represent two shares of <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> common stock. Shareholders and various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese regulatory agencies must approve the merger before it is completed. <ORGANIZATION> AVX </ORGANIZATION> has called a special shareholders meeting in December.

<HEAD>States Propose Settlement in Suit Against Visa, MasterCard</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A settlement offer is on the table in an antitrust lawsuit that alleged Visa and <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> conspired to undermine the competition in developing a national debit card. A debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card, but the money is automatically deducted from the cardholder's account and transferred to the merchant. The settlement proposal was made Thursday by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Costantine </PERSON>, chief of the antitrust unit of the state attorney general's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, on behalf of the 13 states that sued <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> The suit, filed June 26 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, charged that <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> tried to undermine the competition by gaining control of the nation's two largest automatic teller machine networks. The two networks, <ORGANIZATION> Cirrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Downers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>., <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Plus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, had been formulating their own plans for national debit card networks in the early and mid-1980s Visa also took over the <ORGANIZATION> Interlink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the nation's largest regional debit card network. The lawsuit also charged that in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> formed a joint venture called Entree to develop the debit card but purposely dragged their feet on the plan. In the settlement proposal, the states offered to drop their efforts to compel Visa and <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> to divest <ORGANIZATION> Cirrus </ORGANIZATION>, Plus and <ORGANIZATION> Interlink </ORGANIZATION>. In return, <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> would drop the Entree venture. <PERSON> Costantine </PERSON> said the settlement would allow Visa or <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> to separately develop a national debit card. However, he said, the states want a provision people who are credit cardholders of both Visa and <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> to have debit accounts with only one of the companies. The other states that filed suit were <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Costantine </PERSON> said the states decided to offer a settlement because Entree was not yet on the market and because they felt the companies had no intention of putting the national debit card in operation. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>, the attorney for Visa, and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer, said they would discuss the settlement offer with the states. The two companies are to respond to the lawsuit on Nov. 6.

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose 0.3 percent in August, its second consecutive advance, indicating continued growth in the months ahead, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The increase in the Index of Leading Indicators, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future, followed a 0.1 percent gain in July. It declined 0.1 percent in June. Today's index reinforced recent government and private industry reports indicating that the nation's longest peacetime economic expansion will reach its seventh birthday in December. `` I think if we're going to have a recession it probably wo n't start before then and I still think we will squeeze through 1990 without one,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, senior economic adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` But it wo n't be very buoyant growth. So far this year, the leading indicators have bounced back and forth _ up in January, April, July and August, and down in February, March, May and June. In the past, three consecutive declines sometimes, but not always, have signaled a forthcoming recession. `` This trendless result for 1989 seems consistent with the slow growth experience of the overall economy,'' said <PERSON> Ysabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Five of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up the composite index contributed to the August gain _ an increase in manufacturers' new orders, higher stock prices, an increase in the money supply, lower inital unemployment claims and increased building permits. The others pointed down _ a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; lower prices for sensitive meaterials, indicating slower demand; a decrease in manufactuers' unfilled orders; fewer orders for plants and equipment; faster vendor deliveries, meaning declining demand and a shorter workweek. The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982 base of 100. So far this year, the index has risen at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent for all of 1988. The economy has been growing steadily since November 1982 when the nation came out of its last recession, but many thought it might be pushed into another downturn this year by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to slow inflation. Beginning in March 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gradually tightened the nation's credit supply. It's goal became known as the `` soft-landing'' _ continued, but slower economic growth to keep inflationary pressures in rein. Some economists, like <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> government securities dealer, try to avoid the `` soft-landing'' description. `` The term is so overused that I hate to use it,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` In some sense, it's not a landing story at all. It's an economy that's growing at lower altitude of GNP -LRB- gross national product -RRB- growth than we saw last year.'' The lower altitude is reflected in several recent reports by government and private economists. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s latest survey of conditions around the country, for instance, found the economy continuing the grow at the midpoint of the third quarter at a pace ranging from slow to moderate, depending on region. And the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> on Monday released a report saying nearly two-thirds of the 72 forecasting experts it surveyed said they think a recession is not likely before 1991. A third of those said another recession will not arrive until 1992 or later. It was a dramatic reversal from a <ORGANIZATION> NABE </ORGANIZATION> survey last February which found 75 percent of the participants expected a recession this year or next.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has a license to run a casino, but it came with a lecture from regulators angry that he failed to quickly cut ties with an associate who allegedly had indirect links to underworld figures. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> last year, will face another challenge in February when he goes before the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for relicensure of the debt-ridden casino. Resorts suspended interest payments to bondholders last month, saying it was n't generating enough cash to pay its bills and make needed repairs to the hotel-casino. Resorts bondholders still must approve a proposed refinancing, which the company says may be necessary to keep it from seeking bankruptcy reorganization. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said Thursday that in retrospect, he probably would not have bought Resorts. `` I probably would n't have done this deal, but I would have done some kind of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> deal,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> for maintaining ties with his longtime business manager, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>, after learning of accusations that <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> had ties to organized crime. <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> denies the allegations. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> testified that his first knowledge of the allegations came in August 1988, when the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> informed him that <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> had associations with underworld figures. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was underwriting the financing of the Resorts deal. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> hired his own investigators, who raised similar allegations, and reported them to the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> removed <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> from any involvement in the Resorts transaction and fired <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> had hired to monitor the acquisition of Resorts, but did not terminate other business relationships with <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> until this May. The entertainer said he retained <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> because <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> had not been charged with any crime and was a victim of guilt by association. <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> also was interviewed under oath by the state gaming division, and he has launched a legal battle to keep confidential the results of the probe concerning his associations. <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> on Thursday condemned the casino commission's comments about him, and rejected suggestions that he had ties to people with links to organized crime. `` I am distressed to learn that the commission has chosen to rely upon and disclose the conclusions of a report that are baseless and unfounded. I have had a long and distinguished business career. At no time have I associated with members of organized crime,'' <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> said in a statement read by his lawyer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Satz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> would not comment further. Read said the reasons <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> gave for firing <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>, which centered on <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s dissatisfaction with the acquisition of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> radio station, were `` disturbing.'' `` It seems fair to say from the record as a whole that <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> continued to employ <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> after the investigative reports because it was in his business interest to do so, and terminated <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON> only when <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>' business performance became unsatisfactory,'' said Read. But Read said the one incident should not cause the panel to question <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s `` good character, honesty and integrity.''

<HEAD>Takeover Panel Upholds Hoylake Extension, Rejects BAT Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers rejected today an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to reverse a decision giving <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> more time to complete its $ 22 billion hostile bid for the conglomerate. The regulatory panel's appeal committee upheld the Sept. 15 decision that BAT shareholders should have the chance to consider the <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> offer free from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory obstacles. `` In principle we see no reason for disagreeing'' with the decision of the full panel, the committee said in a statement. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, which is led by financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, had sought the extension because it must seek approval of regulatory authorities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it can acquire BAT's <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A bidder in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> usually is given 90 days to win control of its target, a deadline <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> is not expected to Without an extension, a bidder generally must wait a year before renewing its offer. The takeover panel ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> could make a new offer for BAT within 21 days of overcoming its regulatory obstacles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. BAT had argued to the appeals committee that allowing <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> more time would place the conglomerate under siege. BAT stock was unchanged at 818 pence, or $ 13.33, a share in early trading on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has offered 878 pence, or $ 14.31, in securities for each BAT share on July 11. BAT said Friday after the panel announced its decision its shareholders have shown `` quite clearly that <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s proposals are wholly unacceptable.'' Although <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> is now 11 weeks into its bid, BAT said, only a `` minuscule'' number of shareholders have accepted the offer. At the last announced count, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> had obtained less than 3 percent of BAT's shares. Analysts have said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> must put some cash into its offer for the bid to succeed. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s group it welcomed the appeals committee decision. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has said it plans to sell Farmers to the French insurance company <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurances </ORGANIZATION>. `` To this end, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> and its advisers are in discussion with <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> and its advisers to coordinate their activities in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in the most efficient manner,'' <PERSON> Hoylake </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, BAT announced a major restructuring designed to fend off BAT's bid. BAT's plans are to pare its operations into two core areas of financial services and tobacco through the sale and spinoffs of its retail and paper businesses. BAT's shareholders are to vote on these proposals on Oct. 19. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has said it would vote in favor of the BAT restructuring as a first step toward breaking up the conglomerate. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> wants to sell off all of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s non-tobacco assets.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday it is asking federal regulators and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to investigate recent media reports about the company, which is a rumored takeover target. The announcement came after <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock rose sharply amid talk that the airline would be taken over or restructured. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.75 a share to close at $ 83.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. Trading was heavy, with more than two million shares changing hands. `` <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is asking the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to investigate recent <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> press reports regarding the company,'' American spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. He added he could not comment further on the reports or the reason for the investigation. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were not immediately available for comment. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock rose partly because of rumors that a takeover offer was imminent, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> fingered as a possible suitor. A stock arbitrager told <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that `` the <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> rumor is all over the place.'' Also Thursday, a rumor surfaced that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> managers could be considering an employee stock ownership plan that would place some company stock _ possibly as much as 15 to 20 percent _ in the hands of airline workers. A source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that such a stake could be large enough to hinder an unsolicited takeover bid. Speculation surfaced on Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> was on <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s restricted list, meaning the company refrains from making recommendations on whether to buy or sell the company's stock. Traders said that signaled that a deal or defensive restructuring could happen soon, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Another rumor involved a management-led buyout, with participation from <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots' union and investors <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>China To Lose $1.3 Billion in Tourist Revenues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> last June has cost the People's Republic at least $ 1 billion in lost tourist revenues, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official said Thursday `` We lost $ 1 billion or so this year,'' said Chinese Counsel General <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanzhen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after a brief appearance at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and Marketing Professionals. A panel of Asian experts said the lost tourist revenues would total $ 1.3 billion by the end of the year. The official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government travel service had expected tourist revenues of $ 2.6 billion this year, up from $ 2 billion in 1988. <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> was optimistic that the tourist trade would snap back. `` By next year it will be fully recovered,'' he predicted. `` What happened in June and July is a very minor event in the course of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s history. But others at the meeting disagreed on how quickly travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would pick up. Tour operator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marona </PERSON> said it would be `` a slow process.'' `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tourism industry today is in serious trouble,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. While he encouraged travel professionals to send clients to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he recommended they travel in groups. `` Individual travel, especially in the disturbed areas, should be kept to a minimum,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. A survey of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel agents and tour operators by the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> indicated that only 8 percent of clients with summer reservations for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> kept their plans.

 <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to be acquired for $ 440 million, or $ 40 a share in cash, to <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The transaction was the result of an auction process supervised by a special committee of independent directors,'' Vermont American Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a news release Thursday. `` The board was very pleased with the transaction and the benefits it will provide for <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> shareholders as well as its employees, customers and the communities in which it operates,'' he said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, said the buyers' `` intention is to operate the company as it's structured now.'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> plan to retain the current management of the Louisville-based Vermont American and anticipate no layoffs or plant closings, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Nearly 4,000 people are employed by <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>. In a statement, <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> said they will form a new company that next week will begin a tender offer for all Vermont American shares. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> will have equal shares of the new company. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s biggest customer _ <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ will be a minority shareholder in the company after the sale, the statement said. There is little to stand in the way of the deal because the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> families of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> control more than half of <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock, and they have agreed to the sale. The buyers already have agreements to purchase 55 percent of the company's outstanding shares from `` principal shareholders,'' which would include the two families, the news release said. Those shares would be bought at the same price paid other shareholders, it said. The price could be adjusted to $ 41 a share if pending litigation with <ORGANIZATION> Newell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> suitor, is resolved, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s stock was trading at $ 37.50 a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up $ 1.25, when trading was halted pending the announcement. The company has been best known as a maker of blades for cutting tools. It has diversified, however, and recently its <ORGANIZATION> Gilmour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which produces lawn and garden equipment, has been a fast-growing segment of the company. Last year, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reported profits of $ 16.8 million, or $ 1.67 a share, on sales of $ 329 million. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, which makes electronic and electrical products and consumer, industrial and defense goods, had sales of $ 6.17 billion last year and employs about 68,000 people. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> makes automotive components, home appliances, photographic equipment and other products.

 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> would be the headquarters of a proposed computer reservation system combining the systems of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The airlines said Thursday they had reached a preliminary agreement for the joint venture, 10 days after it was disclosed that the companies were discussing such a plan. The system would be autonomous and independently managed, but <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> would own the largest portion and one of its executives would be the new company's chief executive officer. Ownership of the new system was carved up according to the relative size of the carriers in the industry, said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>. The system would combine the technologically superior Pars reservation system, started three years ago by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s Datas II system. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 48 million to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> under the proposal. The announcement earlier this month that the three carriers were talking came as no surprise to industry observers, who had expected <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> to pursue some type of venture after a previous attempt to merge its reservation system with industry leader <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, ran into regulatory roadblocks. <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said the airlines decided to announce the discussions earlier this month `` because we knew it would leak out.'' The proposed Datas II-Sabre plan was dropped after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> threatened to file an antitrust suit. The agency said that venture would harm competition in the computerized sale of airline tickets. Industry analysts have said the new plan is less likely to draw such opposition because Pars is considerably smaller than <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>. Sabre is used by 12,800 travel agency offices and is the biggest of the five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computerized reservation systems. <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said Pars is in third place and Datas II is No. 5. <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> declined to predict how big a market share the new company would have because it would be about four years before it is running. Though no single carrier will control the new company, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> will own the largest chunk at 40 percent. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, Minn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will own 33.3 percent, and New York-based <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> will own 26.6 percent. The joint system would be consistent with the design of emerging international reservations systems, the three airlines said in an announcement. The three airlines also said other carriers will have an opportunity to become partners. When the agreement is finalized, a data center will be designed and built in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The new company will begin developing software and operating systems for the joint venture. The company also will have marketing offices in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Reservations systems make money from fees charged to airlines. A carrier pays the system a fee whenever it books a flight for that airline. The computer systems are the primary channel for distributing airline tickets. They provide information about schedules, fares, seat availability, hotels, car rentals and package vacations. <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>, vice president for marketing automation at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, is to be chief executive officer of the joint system.

 <PERSON> Spuds </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, fun-loving party dog from <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, meet your new partner: <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON>, that well-known killer whale <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it agreed to pay $ 1.1 billion for the four Sea World parks around the country plus two other theme parks from <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have considered <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> as the ideal acquisition for some period of time,'' said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, vice president and group executive for <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>. The deal will make the brewer the second largest theme park operator in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> behind <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and will help <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> pay off the huge debt the publishing and insurance company accumulated in thwarting a hostile takeover two years ago. But Wall Street apparently was displeased with the deal. <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> stock had plunged $ 3.87 -LCB- a share to $ 12.37 -LCB- in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Stock analysts who follow <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> applauded the acquisition, but said it will have very little impact on the St. Louis-based company's profits or makeup. `` This is a real drop in the beer barrel, but it's a diversification move that's going to work and that's better than one that does n't work,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Stifel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicolaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc.. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading beer maker, has four core businessess: beer, food, container manufacturing and family However, 90 precent of the company's sales come from beer and beer-related ventures. `` The Sea World acquisition will give us a broad base for future expansion,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. He said the purchase should be completed in November. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> already operates <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, one of the biggest zoos in the country; a 17th century European-style park in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; a water park in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>; and a futuristic children's park near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The company also is planning a major theme park and resort in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast just south of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. It's scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993. The popular Sea World parks, which feature performing killer whales, trained dolphins and other talented creatures from the sea, are located in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The other parks involved in the deal are <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and Baseball in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The purchase also includes land adjacent to the three <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> parks, the Sea World of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> airport. Overall attendance at the parks was 14.5 million last year. Analysts say <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON>, a leading textbook publisher, is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a nearly $ 2.9 billion debt it accumulated when the Orlando-based company fended off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by British communications mogul <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- did n't have a whole lot of choice,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But in giving up the theme park business, <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> also is relieving itself of chronic management problems and falling attendance at the six parks. In 1988, sales at the parks totaled $ 388 million and pre-tax earnings were $ 62 million. This year pre-tax earnings were projected to rise to $ 90 million, analysts said. Only two bidders for the park actually went public with their plans. One was a group of former <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> executives led by <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Millay </PERSON>. The other was <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leisure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the Silver Springs attraction in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> has been in the theme park business for 13 years. The purchase price of $ 1.1 billion includes $ 975 for the theme parks and the rest for the <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION>'s land holdings. The agreement also calls for <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> to receive half of the profits over $ 100 million from any sale of this land.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Belgian national bank raised short-term interest rates for the third time in a week on Friday, while the Swiss national bank also hiked a key lending rate. The <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> said the three-month treasury bill rate, considered the most important in Belgian banking, was raised 0.30 percentage point to 9.20 percent. One-month and two-month treasury certificates were also raised 0.30 percentage point to 9.00 percent and 9.10 percent, respectively. Belgian short-term rates were last changed Wednesday, when they were raised 0.15 percentage point across the board. Since early this month short-term rates have risen by as much as 0.75 percentage point. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s short-term interest rates have been rising in tandem with West German rates in recent weeks. In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> set the Lombard rate at 8.25 percent, up -LRB- percentage point from Thursday. The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as collateral. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, there were concerns in the financial markets that the government might increase interest rates, which stand at 14 percent, to bolster the pound. Sterling was hit by poor trade figures released on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures were mixed early today's on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following a government report showing smaller wheat supplies and larger corn and soybean stocks than traders had expected. The corn and soybean markets opened lower in reaction to the quarterly report, then rallied in sympathy with the wheat market, where the price for near-term delivery surged above $ 4 a bushel for the first time in two weeks. `` It's hard to keep the bean market down when you've got corn fractionally lower and wheat four cents higher,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based futures brokerage. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91 billion bushels, essentially unchanged from a year ago, compared to trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion. Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels, compared with estimates averaging 1.89 billion and year-ago stocks of 4.26 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels, compared with estimates averaging 159 million and year-ago stocks of 302 million. In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 5 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.04 -LCB- a bushel; corn futures were -RCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.33 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.44 \ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1 cent higher with November at $ 5.70 -LCB- a Cattle futures were higher and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .52 cent higher with October at 72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent higher with October at 83.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October at 43.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .27 cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at 48.70 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> said today it has received government approval to sell 11 branches to <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at a $ 40 million profit, pushing <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> toward operating in the black. `` These sale transactions are evidence of the major strides we are making toward our goal of profitability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. The bank also announced the sale of a subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GSI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, to a limited partnership formed by <ORGANIZATION> GSI </ORGANIZATION> senior executives. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> will realize a $ 10 million profit from the sale. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the divestitures are part of a comprehensive restructuring plan that has the bank `` confidently looking toward the 1990s.'' <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchnowski </PERSON> said the deals are a sign that the bank, founded in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> in 1846, is continuing the restructuring process <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> began when he became <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer in April. She said the chances are `` very good'' that <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> will show a profit in the fourth quarter, when the profit from the sale of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-area </LOCATION> branches will be recorded. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> has not reported a profit since the third quarter of 1987. The sale includes six branches in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, four on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and one in suburban <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The sale price was not announced. Both the state <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> granted <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> permission to proceed after reviewing charges that Manufacturers Hanover had made insufficient and discriminatory mortgage loans in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> will retain 17 other branches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and its suburbs. Those branches have about $ 1.8 billion in deposits. The bank will also continue to retain all consumer and mortgage loans made by the branches that were sold to Manufacturers Hanover, which will get the branches and its $ 1.2 billion in deposits.

 The stock market kept climbing today, extending Thursday's late rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 21.85 points Thursday, rose 9.31 to 2,704.22 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 725 up, 546 down and 544 unchanged. Analysts said the market appeared to benefit from last-minute buying by investing institutions readying their portfolios for reports to clients on the third quarter, which ends with today's session But they said uncertainty over recent weakness in the dollar and some upward pressure on interest rates limited enthusiasm for stocks. The government reported this morning that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3 percent in August. The figure came in close to advance estimates on the Street, and had little perceptible effect on the market. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up | at 57 |; <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- at 166 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up | at 44 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 119 <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON> tumbled 3 ~ to 12 -RRB- as the most active <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issue Analysts cited disappointment over the $ 1.1 billion price for which <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> agreed to buy six <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> amusement parks.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has become the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics company to decline to join the chip-making consortium called <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` At this time, we have decided not to fund them,'' an <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman confirmed Thursday. `` It does n't fit into our top priorities right now.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memories </ORGANIZATION> is a $ 1 billion collaborative venture aimed at breaking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign-made memory chips known as DRAMs, or dynamic, random-access memory chips. DRAMs are used in everything from computers to fax machines, and Japanese companies dominate the world's supply. The consortium's success depends on finding companies willing to invest in capital in return for an assured supply of DRAMs. But industry analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s decision is an isolated letdown. `` It's not a turning point,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a semiconductor analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. `` I'm not sure it would discourage another company from participating if they thought it was to their advantage to do so.'' A shortage of memory chips last year led <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> to hike the price of its computers, which hurt the company's profits. However, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> now says it can fill its DRAM needs without another source. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories was `` caught off guard'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> announcement, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Entin </PERSON>, spokesman for chairman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, president and chief executive, told the <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that he was negotiating with 17 companies, none of which had turned him down.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> today announced approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> after first insisting on steps to prevent foreign control of the airline Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will alleviate government concerns about the interest of <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and foreign banks in the takeover by the holding company set up by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has said the government is concerned about increasing foreign investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines because it could compromise negotiations with foreign governments over routes. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, at a news conference with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, said in a statement that he disagreed with some of the government's conclusions in the $ 3.65 billion deal, including the influence <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> would have over the company. `` We do not agree that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> is, or has ever been, in a position to exercise any actual control over <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said in the statement. However, <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to reduce <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s interest, dissolve a three-member <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> financial advisory committee and take away the voting power of <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s one seat on <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 12-member board on certain issues. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> as a man with an outstanding reputation with both management and employees. As part of the agreement to approve the takeover, the department will conduct a continuing review of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s finances, requiring regular reports from the company. The department also had expressed concern about the more than $ 3 billion in debt that the takeover gives the airline, the nation's sixth largest Under the original arrangement, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> was providing $ 400 million of the $ 700 million that <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> raised to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, but would have controlled only 5 percent of its voting stock. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded, however, that the deal would put <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> `` in a position to exercise control over <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'' and that it would in effect no longer be considered a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier under the law. Foreign companies can not own more than 25 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the department has an obligation to determine whether any acquisition will allow an airline to continue giving safe service and remain under the control of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Earlier this week, the government asked <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to disclose how much a planned employee management takeover will allow foreign influence over that airline. The $ 6.5 billion stock buyout plan includes participation from British Airways. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> declines to respond to questions on the department's review of that transaction

<HEAD>Sony Won't Make Rambo a Samurai After Buyout of Columbia Pictures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the next Hollywood blockbuster hits American movie screens, you may be able to say, `` It's a <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says its $ 3.4 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which follows its 1987 buyout of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, is aimed at getting involved in making `` software'' to use in the audio-visual equipment it sells. But do n't worry about Rambo decked out as a samurai next time around, or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> singing in Japanese. What <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> wants out of these American companies, say analysts, is for them to keep doing what they're best at _ turning out the American-style entertainment that dominates cinema and music markets worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s recent wheeling and dealing involved some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pop icons: Rambo, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to name a few <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it is buying the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> studios, home of Rambo. Two years ago it plunked down $ 2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, which has contracts with stars such as <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> stands to collect $ 1.45 billion from selling its 49 percent share in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>. But while a few <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pundits have raised concerns that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> may use its new media clout for `` propaganda'' purposes, industry analysts in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> scoff. `` I do n't think they would be so stupid,'' says <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>, a senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Jardine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Propaganda films probably would n't be great hits at the box office, he notes, and censorship would be too dangerous. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is far too sophisticated to consider something as blatantly inappropriate -LRB- as propaganda or censorship -RRB- ... they know that even the merest whiff of that would constitute an enormous public relations risk.'' Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> has taken a hands-off policy at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, leaving the music-making to Americans while providing Japanese financial backing. So far this formula has made the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> venture far more profitable than analysts had expected. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s last annual report noted with satisfaction that `` a large number of hit albums'' from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> contributed to a 37.9 percent annual increase in overall sales, which hit $ 16.2 billion in the year ended March 31. The company's net income, at $ 549 million, was up 94.6 percent from the previous year. `` As is the case with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, we would intend to operate <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> management,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Norio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohga </PERSON> said. In effect, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> wants to sell <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> `` software'' _ what used to be known as movies and television shows _ in new forms, such as laser disks and 8mm video tapes. Analysts say it's a rational division of labor. While Japanese electronics companies are crack manufacturers and exporters of gee-whiz technology, the Japanese film and music industries are about as competitive in world markets as American soy sauce makers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> movies, by contrast, are one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest export success stories from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hollwood </PERSON> is dream-seller to the world, with entertainment ranking as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s second largest export, netting $ 5 billion annually Rambo can be seen -LRB- surreptitiously -RRB- in even isolationist <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>; `` The Last Emperor,'' also a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> film, was shown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, American films are so popular that alleged agents of local filmmakers, fearing competition, released snakes and tear gas into theaters to discourage people from seeing directly distributed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films. The reception in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is friendlier. Japanese love American films as much as Americans love Japanese electronics. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> exports more movies to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> than to any other single market; entertainment is one area in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enjoys a surplus with its economic archrival. `` For many Japanese, ` movies' means American movies. They do n't think of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> films as foreign films,'' says <PERSON> Hidekazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, an official at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> branch Among films shown in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year, 289 were American, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Only 102 were Japanese. The top four grossing films in Japanese history were `` E.T.,'' `` Star Wars,'' `` Jaws,'' and `` Ghostbusters,'' according to industry statistics. `` Ghostbusters,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> release, brought in profits of $ 17.8 million in 1984. `` Fatal Attraction'' recovered all of its production costs in Japanese theaters alone. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is reportedly eager to expand the number of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s library of more than 2,700 movies available on laser disk and 8mm video Classic Columbia films popular in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> include `` Bridge over the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kwai </LOCATION>,'' `` Lawrence of <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>,'' and `` On the Waterfront.''

 Share prices closed modestly higher on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Friday on a flurry of new trading-account buying and the retreat of worries over an imminent increase in British interest rates The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 7.7 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,299.4, the day's high. Early in the session, when rumors of an interest rate hike swept the market, the key index dropped to its session low of 2,278.3. Volume was 495.1 million shares, up from 403.5 million shares Thursday. The day's early losses were reversed when the new two-week account opened 90 minutes before the market closed and some new buying came into the generally thin market, dealers said. The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week periods for accounting purposes.

<HEAD>Privatization Postponed Up to Six Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Friday it would postpone its huge privatization of the electricity industry for up to six months because of the complexity of the sell-off. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON> said in a statement: `` The government remains on target to complete the privatization of the industry within this parliament,'' before the next election. But he said sticking to the previous timetable `` would require additional transitional arrangements which would have introduced added complexity to the task and made it more difficult for us to meet our objective.'' The next general election must be called before mid-1992. The government plans to split into two companies the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which now has a monopoly to supply electricity to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. The 12 existing regional boards are to be turned into companies that will buy electricity and sell it to homes and industry in their regions. The electricity area boards are expected to be sold off in the fall of 1990 instead of next spring or summer. The generating companies are to be sold in first half of 1991, instead of fall 1990 to spring 1991. The electricity privatization, which is expected to raise anywhere between $ 24 billion and $ 44 billion, faces strong opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other government critics who believe the utility should remain in state hands. The government also is in the process of selling off the water industry. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government has sold off billions of dollars of state-owned companies to the public in the past decade to promote capitalism in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hoylake Lets Offer Lapse While Its Seeks U.S. Approval</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> let its $ 22 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> lapse Friday as expected while it sought regulatory approval in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the hostile bid. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, an investor group led by financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, took the step after a committee of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers upheld a decision giving <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> more time to pursue its takeover attempt. A bidder in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> usually is given 90 days to win control of its target. If it fails, it must wait a year before bidding again. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, which must win permission from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissioners before it can acquire BAT's <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was not expected to meet the deadline. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> launched its bid on June 11; the offer was scheduled to expire Oct. 7. The takeovers panel decided earlier this month that <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> could bid again for BAT within 21 days of obtaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory approval. BAT had argued to the appeals committee that allowing <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> more time would place it under siege, but the panel found in favor of the investor group. The conglomerate responded to today's decision by noting that while <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> was 11 weeks into its bid, only a `` minuscule'' number of shareholders have accepted the offer. BAT stock rose 2 pence, or 3 cents, a share to close at 820 pence, or $ 13.37, a share on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the decision was announced. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> offered 878 pence, or $ 14.31, worth of securities for each BAT share on July 11. The offer totaled 13.41 billion pounds, or $ 22 billion, and if successful would be the second-largest takeover in the world behind the $ 24.53 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s group has control of 2.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION>'s banker, <ORGANIZATION> Hambros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <PERSON> Hambros </PERSON> said the bid had been accepted by shareholders representing 0.05 percent of BAT's stock. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> and related parties own about 2.26 percent outright. BAT said Friday after the panel announced its decision that the conglomerate's shareholders have shown `` quite clearly that <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s proposals are wholly unacceptable.'' Securities analysts have said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> must put at least some cash into its offer for the deal to succeed. In an effort to speed approval of its bid in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> announced last month it would sell Farmers to the French insurance company <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurances </ORGANIZATION>, which already does business in several states. `` To this end, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> and its advisers are in discussion with <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> and its advisers to coordinate their activities in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in the most efficient manner,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. On Tuesday, BAT announced a major restructuring designed to fend off BAT's bid. BAT said it would pare its operations into two core areas of financial services and tobacco through the sale and spinoffs of its retail and paper businesses. BAT's shareholders are to vote on these proposals on Oct. 19. The conglomerate's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail operations, which are being put on the block, include <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s.

 Wheat futures prices closed sharply higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that indicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supplies were smaller than traders had expected. Corn and soybean futures finished modestly lower, partly on harvest pressure and partly in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s report of larger-than-expected stocks of those commodities. In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91 billion bushels, essentially unchanged from a year ago, compared to trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion. Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels compared to trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion and year-ago stocks of 4.26 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels, compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million and year-ago stocks of 302 million. Traders said a surge in in export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains during the week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in the corn and soybean markets. At the close, wheat futures were 2 \ cents to 7 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.33 a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.43 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 \ cents lower with November at $

 <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would reduce its asset value about $ 300 million after a preliminary investigation into accounting irregularities at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary showed the defense company was defrauded. In a letter to shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said the company would have to reduce its net asset value by about $ 302 million. <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> had net asset value of $ 451 million at the end of its last financial year. <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said the reductions were forced by `` serious fraud'' in the reporting of non-existent contracts at its <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> unit at the time it bought the <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, Pa.-based company in 1987. `` It is now clear that the price paid to the shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> ISC </ORGANIZATION> ... was substantially inflated as a result of the fraud,'' <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> bought the company for $ 685 million. In the letter, <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> board was reviewing three options to inject new capital into the company: a full takeover bid, inviting an investor to buy a major stake in Ferranti or issuing more shares to existing shareholders. <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> has received shows of interests from a large number of British and foreign companies about the various options. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> also will forgo a final dividend payment for the year to last March 31, allowing the company to save $ 21 million, he said. To offset the asset write-off, <PERSON> Alun-Jones </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> board felt it would be necessary to raise at least $ 244 million in new equity. The group has already outlined plans to reduce indebtedness by selling about $ 163 million of assets.

<HEAD>`Chinese Wall' Separating Banks From Securities Houses Crumbling</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead graf to recast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bit by bit, the once-impenetrable `` Chinese wall'' separating commercial banks from investment houses is crumbling. The latest fissure came two weeks ago when <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> became the first bank to announce it will manage a public sale of corporate bonds. Until recent years, banks were barred from most activities associated with the securities business, such as selling stocks and corporate bonds, under the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall was partly prompted by the banks' practice during the 1920s of helping companies sell stock or bonds to the public at inflated prices; the companies would then use the proceeds to repay shaky loans to the banks. The crash of 1929 made it harder for banks to dump unsound loans on stock and bond investors. Banks also lost money on underwritings that were n't related to their own borrowers. The result was a string of bank failures in the 1930s. Banks for many years have been permitted to sell low-risk <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and general-obligation municipal bonds, but the expanded powers granted in recent years allow banks to enter a world forbidden to them since 1933 by Glass-Steagall. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> gave banks the authority to underwrite municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by consumer loans. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gave preliminary approval for <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and four other large banks to underwrite corporate bonds. Final approval was given over the summer. The call by banks for the new powers was backed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstrations, which said they are needed to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks to compete globally. The new banking powers are strongly opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the nation's investment houses. The group has a lawsuit pending that is intended to repeal the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s actions. The trade group contends that banks may be endangering their depositors' money, which is federally insured, by engaging in the risky practice of securities underwriting. The group also argues that if changes need to be made to Glass-Steagall, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should do the changing, not the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. `` A statute that everyone understood for almost 50 years has been literally gutted by regulators,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a vice president of the trade group. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s actions also have a number of congressional critics. After the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gave its preliminary approval to bank bond underwriting, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, compared it to inviting banks `` to shoot craps with the taxpayers' money. `` This is the kind of irresponsible behavior that gave us the savings and loan crisis and brought about the 1929 crash,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> placed a number of restrictions on the sale of bonds by banks. One requires that this underwriting be done by separately capitalized subsidiaries so that deposits are not put at risk. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also effectively restricted bond underwriting to the nation's largest banks Bankers Trust announced last month that it will underwrite a $ 150 million junk bond issue for <ORGANIZATION> Morningstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a producer and distributor of dairy products. Some have questioned the wisdom of banks putting any of their capital at risk in the high-risk junk bond market. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> speculates that the practice may lead <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reexamine federal banking laws. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says such fears are unfounded. `` There's proper safeguards,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s restrictions on bank underwriting. <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> contends that the expanded banking powers are a necessary modernization of banking rules. However, the banking trade group agrees that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, not the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, should be making the changes. The banks contend that the increased competition in bond underwriting they will bring to the market will make it cheaper for corporations to float new bond issues. `` Ultimately we expect to be a force in the -LRB- bond -RRB- marketplace,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasel </PERSON>, vice president of corporate communications for Bankers Trust. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it will decide by early next year whether they also may also underwrite stock issues. The brokerage firms contend that the eventual outcome of the expanded bank powers will be the destruction of the securities industry. `` There will be no problem with a bank the size of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> going out and buying <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. He said that when <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s equivalent of Glass-Steagall was repealed a few years ago, banks went on a buying spree. Today, he said, there are few broker-dealers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that are n't owned by a bank.

<HEAD>Braniff Won't Pay Laid-Off Workers; Announces Reduced Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said that 2,700 employees laid off when the airline sought bankruptcy protection will not receive their last paychecks. The <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, Fla.-based airline also announced discount fares and a limited scheduled for next week. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> said workers who were not laid off after the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankrptcy Thursday for the second time in seven years will be paid, possibly early next week. The laid-off workers will not be paid. `` There are a great many unhappy stories in a bankruptcy,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I worked for a year to get this job ... six interviews,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> McElwee </PERSON>, a flight attendant who was laid off and planned to return to her parents home in <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I'm not a happy camper right now. I wanted to go home, but not like this.'' <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, offered a discount fare of $ 49 to any of the cities the airline plans to serve next week. The fares would be good for three days beginning Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> on Friday operated flights to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> planned to add a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The airline next week plans to add round-trip flights to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said a bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> had authorized the airline to pay employees who continue to work, and to give employees their Sept. 29 paycheck if they are recalled. Those laid off included pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and others. A spokesman for Missouri Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> said about 1,900 workers _ including <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees and those in related industries _ would be affected in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had been attempting to establish a hub. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> began canceling flights in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon, and filed for bankruptcy at 1:30 a.m. Thursday. The Chapter 11 filing protects the airline from its creditors while it attempts to reorganize. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had 93 flights out of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and had planned to add eight flights Sunday. The airline's plans eventually called for 200 flights daily, and it was pressing the city for terminal improvements and construction of a maintenance base and a concourse for its commuter flights. Industry analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles began when it was forced to pay $ 32 million to acquire rights to gates at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> moved in at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bailed out of an attempt to establish a hub operation. The airline apparently had thought <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> could sell tax-free, low interest bonds to finance the transaction, but later learned that would be prohibited by state law. A plan to borrow $ 75 million then unraveled. `` They simply ran out of cash and had a payroll to meet,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, editor of Commercial Aviation Week.

If the market can hang on over the next three months to the gains it has racked up so far, it will chalk up the eighth consecutive yearly gain for the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index, the yardstick most Wall Street professionals use to measure their performance. That's a long winning streak by any standard. And veteran stock traders have long since schooled themselves that no rally lasts forever. Yet stirrings already are being heard in the financial world of optimistic talk about the outlook for 1990 and perhaps beyond. After rising with only a few brief interruptions through the first eight months of the year, hitting a record high on Sept. 1, stocks have since backtracked a bit. There were a few unsettling days in the market for `` junk bond'' takeover debt after it became evident that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> was having trouble digesting the retailing empire it had amassed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the same time, analysts said, money managers at investing institutions were toting up the gains they had achieved since New Year's and looking for ways to protect those profits from any reversal in the market's course. `` It appears that many, many money managers have decided not to play for fear of messing up a great year,'' observed <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnaruma </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` During this recent sideways movement volume has contracted considerably,'' noted <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFevre </PERSON>, strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Much of current volume is program-related, usually done by and for the brokerage houses themselves. `` So one might conclude the public, institutional and individual, is just sitting there on the sidelines. `` What both the stock and bond markets await is some sort of trigger device to get things off dead center. That trigger device could be a resumption of interest rate cuts.'' If interest rates are indeed headed lower, they ran into an obstacle this past week in the form of downward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange. But the stock market managed to post some modest gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,692.82, up 11.21 from the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 1.24 to 193.97; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 5.21 to 473.28, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 7.38 at 388.76. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 151.48 million shares a day, against 139.09 million the week before. For the first nine months of the year, the Dow Jones industrials show a net gain of 534.25 points, or 24.64 percent. `` Many investors' portfolios have performed better this year than they anticipated, given their fairly meager expectations at the start of the year,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those investors are becoming very cautious about doing anything for the remainder of the year, lest they give those windfall gains away. Unless some outside catalyst forces people to become more aggressive in the marketplace, we face a fairly uneventful finish to this year.'' However, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> adds, `` looking ahead to 1990, I expect a fairly bright intermediate - to long-term environment This is the time of year when we have come to expect all those forecasts of an imminent recession to be shoved out another 12 months or so. `` With that change in economic assumption, more investors should feel comfortable with the equity market.''

 The parent of rumored takeover target <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Friday urged federal regulators and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to investigate recent media reports on the company. The <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> request came after its stock rose $ 4.75 as more than two million shares changed hands Thursday amid rumors of an impending takeover bid or defensive restructuring. The gains continued Friday. After a delayed opening, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> added another $ 2.75 to $ 86.50 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. It was the second most active stock on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on volume of more than 2.26 million shares. `` <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today is asking the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to investigate recent <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> press reports regarding the company,'' American spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> would not elaborate on the reports or the reason for the investigation. `` We have no comment on this because there is nothing said about what reports are involved and why they are asking for the investigation,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, director of corporate relations for <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` All we know is the report we've seen that they've asked the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to investigate. It's a little hard to respond to.'' The higher stock price, according to industry and securities analysts, resulted partly from rumors that an <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> takeover bid was imminent, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> a possible bidder for the company. On Thursday, a stock arbitrageur told <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that `` the <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> rumor is all over the place.'' A rumor also surfaced Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> managers could be considering an employee stock ownership plan that would place a small amount of company stock, possibly 15 to 20 percent, in the hands of airline workers. That amount of stock, though less than a controlling interest, could be big enough to hinder an unsolicited takeover bid, a source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, speculation surfaced that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock was on the restricted list of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which would mean the investment banking firm would refrain from making recommendations to buy or sell <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> shares. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, traders said this signaled the possibility that a defensive restructuring or a takeover deal could occur soon. A management-led buyout, with participation from the <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> pilots' union and investors <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, was the subject of another rumor

 The stock market was mixed Friday, pulling back from an early gain in a session typical of the hesitant pattern that has prevailed all through September. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 12 points at midday, closed with a 2.09 loss at 2,692.82. For the week, the average posted a net gain of 11.21 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 885 up, 565 down and 521 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 155.30 million shares, down from 164.24 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 184.73 million shares. Analysts said the market appeared to benefit in early trading from last-minute buying by investing institutions readying their portfolios for reports to clients on the third quarter, which ended with Friday's session. But they said uncertainty over recent weakness in the dollar and some upward pressure on interest rates limited enthusiasm for stocks. The government reported Friday morning that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3 percent in August. The figure came in close to advance estimates on the Street, and had little perceptible effect on the market. After dropping 44.45 points in September, the Dow Jones industrials reached the end of the third quarter showing a net gain of 534.25 points, or 24.64 percent, since New Year's. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 44 ~; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> gained \ to 109 \; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 56 -LCB-, and McDonald's was down | at 29 <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON> tumbled 4 -LRB- to 12 -LRB- as the most active <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issue on volume of more than 3.6 million shares. Analysts cited disappointment over the $ 1.1 billion price for which <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> agreed to buy six <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> amusement parks. <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, which separately announced the death of its former chairman, <ORGANIZATION> August </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION>, rose 1 -LRB- to 43 -RRB-. Airline issues were broadly higher amid signs of a revival of takeover enthusiasm. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> gained 4 -LCB- to 282; AMR 2 -RCB- to 86 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> 2 -RRB- to 73 -RCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Entergy </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 22 |, trading at new 52-week highs The company said it would ask the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for authority to buy back as much as 10 percent of its stock. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 9.54 billion, or 0.28 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .42 to 193.97. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .14 to 397.95, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .55 at 349.15 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 1.78 to 473.28.

 <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is widely touted as the `` whiz kid'' of the nation's airline industry and a highly capable manager. But the 48-year-old <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> faces a daunting test in pulling off the proposed pilot-management buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent. The ambitious takeover _ from which <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> stands to make $ 76.7 million from his <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock and options _ could be dashed by government regulators worried about airline competition. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who left cargo carrier <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 to head <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- then called <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, had earned a reputation for turning troubled companies around. Some people call him the <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> of the airline industry. The lanky -LRB- 6-foot-7 -RRB- <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> built his career by jumping from job to job the way a commuter carrier hops from one town to another. After working 15 years at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, he did much shorter stints as president of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, marketing chief at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, head of now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, then chairman of Tiger. Raised in a working-class family in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> unloaded boxcars at an auto factory and worked on the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> docks before graduating from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 with a degree in sociology. He then started at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike some of the companies where he had worked, <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> was basically a healthy enterprise when <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> arrived on the scene. Still, it was a slumbering giant in the throes of a wrenching restructuring that included sales of its non-airline assets: the <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> hotel chains and the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> rental car company. Since then, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> has cut costs and expanded its fleet _ and <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s already strong reputation has been enhanced. In an industry racked by labor disputes and the rigors of competition, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> have emerged as the most respected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline executives. `` I think there's a lot of faith in'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` He's got very good people skills.'' Those skills are being tested to the limit by the $ 6.75 billion takeover gambit led by <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and other top <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> managers, allied with the company's 7,000 pilots and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The buyout would create the biggest employee-owned company in the nation, with workers holding 75 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for wage and benefit concessions. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who would remain as head of the company, already has flexed his leadership muscle in lining up bank financing for the $ 300-a-share deal. What worries partisans of the buyout, though, is scrutiny by the government, which has been making increasingly loud noises about takeovers of big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines _ the debt they pile up and the foreign partners they bring in. Last Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> until Oct. 10 to furnish information on investors and financial arrangements in the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout plan, with a view to determining how much foreign influence over the airline the takeover would allow. Under the proposal, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would hold 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for a $ 750 million investment, while <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s management group would own the remaining 10 percent. Many analysts and investors fear the government might impose the same limitation on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' role that it did on <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the foreign partner in the recent $ 3.65 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s new principal owner, investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, announced Friday that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> would reduce its interest in the deal in compliance with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> issued a statement late Friday saying he was `` confident'' the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout plan would pass muster with the government. `` The action taken today by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> indicates that Secretary <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is carefully examining each transaction on its own facts,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. But if <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s deal is subjected to similar scrutiny, `` That could make the deal fall apart,'' warned <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Neidl </PERSON>, an analyst at investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc If the British airline's equity contribution were reduced, the buyout might have to be restructured at a lower price or postponed, he suggested. That wariness has been manifest on Wall Street recently. After a dizzying runup, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares last week were trading below the $ 300 offered by the Wolf group. There are other potential obstacles. The Machinists, the largest union at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, have so far refused to participate in the buyout, which would require them to join the pilots in making wage concessions. The Machinists are expected to ask <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> soon to negotiate a new labor contract, and the union could use the issue of its participation as a bargaining chip in the talks. Analysts believe the pilot-management takeover could succeed without the Machinists, who have had a rocky relationship in recent years with the pilots at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> has come under fire from the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Machinists and flight attendants for the estimated $ 76.7 million he stands to reap if the buyout succeeds: $ 22.5 million for his 75,000 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares and $ 54.17 million for his options to buy another 250,000 shares. He quickly countered that he is willing to work without a year's salary and the `` golden parachute'' of severance pay <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> `` must be taking this rather personally,'' said a former associate who asked not to be identified, noting that the airline chief is concerned about impressions and likely was stung by the unions' criticism. If anyone can pull off the ambitious project, it's <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, analysts say. `` I think the deal probably will go through,'' <PERSON> Neidl </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> is very important as part of this deal.''

 Social Security's toll-free telephone service will expand to cover the entire country beginning Sunday, officials said Friday. The service was introduced a year ago, but before the expansion was available to only 60 percent of the country. <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Social Security commissioner, said that while studies show many prefer to deal by phone with the agency, the toll-free service `` is not intended to replace face-to-face contact for anyone who prefers to visit a Social Security office in person.''

<HEAD>Washington's 1988 Apple Income a Record</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apple growers made a record $ 493.6 million in 1988 despite the Alar scare but with the help of a federal bailout, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> reported. The income was about $ 100 million below the department's projections for the year, which likely reflects the impact of Alar, department spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said Thursday After the Alar scare and late in the season, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> created a $ 9.5 million emergency bailout program to distribute stockpiled apples to the poor as a way to reduce supplies. The 1988 income reflects the so-called `` farm gate value'' of apples, which is what farmers receive. It does not represent the value produced by the state's extensive apple processing plants, which turn out juice, apple sauce and other products. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 4,500 growers produce about half the nation's apples The 1988 production value for growers jumped 42 percent over a 1987 crop that was worth just $ 312 million. The 1987 crop was plagued by poor weather and poor quality that depressed prices for the entire year, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The 1988 value was also higher than the 1986 value of $ 488 million, the previous record. The Alar scare began in late February 1988 when a private consumer group issued a report warning that eating apples treated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in children. Although the report's findings were hotly disputed, wholesale prices plunged 50 percent and sales also dropped. Prior to the Alar scare, growers were enjoying an outstanding year and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on March 1 projected apple growers would make $ 588 million for the year, Ms. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said. The actual income was $ 95 million less, she said. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the 1988 record income illustrates how the Alar scare primarily hurt sales of Red Delicious apples, which make up 69 percent of the state's crop. Alar is primarily used on red apples. Prices have begun dropping again in recent weeks as the 1989 crop is harvested and shipped to market. A state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> survey concluded earlier this week that no Alar was used on the 1989 crop.

 `` Rambo'' is a favorite video rental in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Filipinos wear Ghostbusters T-shirts. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> is a cultural hero in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry may be choking, but American cultural imperialism seems to be growing ever stronger _ as <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s foray into <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> this past week showed. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and an independent production company for a total of $ 3.6 billion because it wanted the best in the world, and the best in the world in film and television is American. Hollywood studios are in many ways the opposite of Japanese manufacturers, yet they have discovered their own way to succeed in the global marketplace. Japanese companies excel at churning out millions of perfectly identical gadgets at the lowest possible price; <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> studios release a handful of motion pictures a year, each one different from the last, and spend extravagantly on each one. Japanese companies study each step they take at length; <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> wheeler-dealers make deals over spritzers while `` doing'' lunch. Where Japanese companies employ people for life, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios fire chief executives routinely. The best people in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> operate with a freedom that is unheard of in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Many business advice books tell American chief executives to make their companies more like the Japanese. Maybe, though, the answer is to be more like <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Hollywood, with all its peculiar personalities, may be a model for the rest of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business for the 1990s, argues <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Suber </PERSON>, co-chairman of the film producers program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Hollywood works because its best people, the ones who fight to the top, know how to spot a trend and make money on it before other people even see it coming, <PERSON> Suber </PERSON> said. That is a skill other American businesses could stand to learn. `` People who are capable of turning on a dime have an evolutionary advantage over dinosaurs who need six blocks to turn right,'' <PERSON> Suber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Suber </PERSON>'s fellow chairman in the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> program is none other than <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON>, the whirlwind <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> lawyer and dealmaker who is widely expected to be named by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> as the new chief of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Suber </PERSON> said he is convinced that if <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> takes the job it will be with complete artistic control, probably more than he would get if <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> were owned by an American company. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> `` has an absolute genius for perceiving value before anybody else does,'' <PERSON> Suber </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> knows that any meddling would `` kill the golden goose for sure,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> says the same thing, noting that it has kept its hands off the management of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> after buying it for $ 2 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s esprit de corps comes from cultural and ethnic sameness. Hollywood's comes from the sharing of a dream _ to make a big movie and get rich _ that is shared by people who flock from around the world. In contrast to the image of poolside loungers, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is as hectic and competitive as Wall Street or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s LaSalle Street. The <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> film program accepts only about 7 percent of its applicants, making it harder to get into than medical school. Even those who get in have only a small chance of striking it rich. In the Darwinian world of film and television, hundreds of projects die without being seen by a single viewer. A property that looked hot goes cold by the time the movie is made, or a script does n't quite come together. The challenges of the unknown that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> has learned to cope with are becoming familiar to makers of computers and corn flakes: As competition keeps getting tougher, people who delay decisions until everything is certain will fall behind. `` You've got to have people who have an enormously high tolerance for ambiguity,'' <PERSON> Suber </PERSON> said. In other business and economic news this past week: _ The dollar plunged sharply against major foreign currencies with a strong push from the central banks of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized democracies The Group of Seven acted after agreeing last weekend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the dollar had risen too much in recent months, endangering the improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed to cut the capital gains tax, rejecting an alternative proposal backed by Democratic leaders The tax-cutting measure, supported by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, faces a fight in the Senate. Democrat leaders said the cut would help mainly rich people, while Republicans said it would promote investment and make the economy stronger. _ <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> put itself under bankruptcy court protection for the second time in seven years The airline filed its petition hours after canceling flights, sending workers home and leaving travelers stranded in airports. The carrier, shrunken since its first trip through bankruptcy court, ranks 13th in size in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in the airline business, the buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agreed to restrict the participation of <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in compliance with a government request.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Hit 3-Month High on Stocks Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices climbed to three-month highs Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report indicating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stocks were about 80 million bushels below market expectations. On other commodity markets, corn and soybean futures retreated, livestock and meat futures were mixed, energy futures were mostly higher and precious metals declined. Wheat futures settled 2 \ cents to 7 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.07 \ a bushel, the highest settlement for a near-month wheat contract since June Corn was 1 \ cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.33 a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 cents lower with December at $ 1.44 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with November at $ 5.68 a bushel In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990 at 1.91 billion bushels compared to trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion. Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels compared to trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion, and the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels, compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report provided the main support for the wheat market but traders said a surge in in export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains during the week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in the corn and soybean markets. `` All things considered, I think the market acted real good,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced after the close that it had accepted bids from exporters to cover the sale of 270,000 metric tons of wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at subsidized prices, and market analysts said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was seeking to buy 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also announced that 150,000 metric tons of corn had been sold to unknown destinations, which is often interpreted as a sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rumors that the Soviets were seeking to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn had given corn futures a lift on Thursday. Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly hogs-and-pigs report, which estimated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swine herd as of Sept. 1 at 58.4 million head, about the same as last year and very close to market expectations. But analysts said near-term hog futures may open lower Monday in reaction to another section of the report that showed pork producers had kept slightly more hogs for marketing than traders had expected. The hog report was perceived as slightly bullish for the deferred contracts, though, because it indicated pork producers had backed off a bit on their fall breeding intentions, which would imply a smaller supply of hogs next spring and summer. `` For the short term, the report was a little tinge negative, for the long term, bullish,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, senior livestock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .45 cent lower to .03 cent higher with the contract for delivery in October at 71.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .38 cent higher with October at 43.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .68 cent lower with February at 48.22 cents a pound. Most energy futures prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders were encouraged by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to reach an agreement to limit production. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents lower to 27 cents higher with November at $ 20.13 a barrel; heating oil was .43 cent to .77 cent higher with October at 59.44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .53 cent lower to .65 cent higher with October at 60.40 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures fell moderately on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, despite a drop in the dollar, amid pre-weekend profit-taking. Gold futures ended 30 cents to 90 cents lower with October at $ 367.20 a troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 4 cents lower with October at $ 5.226 a troy ounce.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is seeking illegal profits and civil penalties of more than $ 668,000 from two men who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the `` Yuppie Five'' insider trading case.

<TEXT>
 The dollar resumed its decline Friday under pressure of a fifth straight day of dollar sales by central bankers. After rising slightly on Thursday, the dollar fell to its lowest level since late July. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency has lost more than 4 percent of its value against the West German mark and Japanese yen since last weekend's agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized democracies that the dollar's recent rise was `` inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals. The seven nations in the group are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Central banks have succeeded in getting the dollar down below 140 Japanese yen and 1.9 West German marks, which many traders believe is the ceiling the banks have established. But traders were not confident that the central banks' intervention was over. `` There's a lot of fear of the central banks,'' said one <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> trader. `` They have shown that they are going to be permanently there. They've earned respect.'' `` All the old theory of the foreign exchange market taking on the central banks is fine when you have an insatiable demand for dollars,'' but that is not the case now, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Intervention was lighter than in other days. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> stepped in during <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar eased to 139.35 Japanese yen from 140.85 yen on Thursday. Late Friday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 139.57 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar traded at 139.05 yen, down from 140.50 Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the pound rose to $ 1.6150 from Thursday's late $ 1.6085. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.6195 from $ 1.6107. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.8720 West German marks, down from 1.8818; 1.6220 Swiss francs, down from 1.6308; 1.1770 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1800; 6.3500 French francs, down from 6.3760; and 1,365 Italian lire, down from 1,370.5. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8715 West German marks, down from 1.8810; 1.6225 Swiss francs, down from 1.6310; 6.3535 French francs, down from 6.3735; 2.1090 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1315; 1,363.825 Italian lire, down from 1.369.00; and 1.7183 Canadian dollars down from 1.1803. Gold prices rose early in the day as the dollar weakened but later fell on profit-taking as the dollar showed a modest recovery. The late bid for gold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 367.00 a troy ounce, up from $ 366.50 late Thursday. The Zurich late bid was $ 366.50 an ounce, up from Thursday's $ 366.35. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 369.15 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $ 366.35. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 367.20 an ounce from $ 368.10. Later Republic <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 366.25 an ounce, down from $ 366.90. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 5.23 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.27 late Thursday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 5.226 from $ 5.265.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Recoup Some Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices rebounded late Friday after sustaining modest losses earlier in the day as investors continued to keep a close watch on the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose 7-32 point, or about $ 2.20 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, slipped to 8.23 percent from 8.25 percent late Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was pummeled as central banks for the fifth straight day intervened to drive the dollar lower. Bond prices, which have been tracking the dollar's fortunes, continued their downward progress in early dealings. But bonds recouped some of their losses as the session wore on and volume fizzled. `` The lower the dollar went the less momentum bonds had on the downside. That's a good sign,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It suggests that most of the selling is done for now.'' The dollar stabilized late in the day after an overnight decline. That helped sooth bond traders, who worry that a big slide in the dollar will erode the international value of their holdings. Economists said there was little market reaction to a 0.3 percent increase in the government's Index of Leading Economic Indicators for August, the second straight advance that pointed to continued economic growth in the coming months. The increase in the index, which signals the future direction of economic activity, followed a 0.1 percent gain in July. It declined 0.1 percent in June. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, managing director and money market economist for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market was indifferent to the figure, which reinforced a belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would not relax monetary policy in the near term. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term bonds were unchanged, intermediate securities were as much as 3-32 point higher and long-term issues advanced as much as 7-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was 1.10 higher at 1,169.74. In corporate trading, industrials rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, added 0.08 to 329.32. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 5-32 point to 91 -LCB-. The average yield to maturity slipped to 7.47 percent from 7.48 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills edged up to 8.15 percent as the discount added 1 basis point to 7.89 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.29 percent as the discount advanced 3 basis points to 7.86 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.45 percent as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.85 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge on overnight loans to one another, fell to 8 -LCB- percent after peaking at 9 -RCB- percent during the day. The rate was 9 \ percent late Thursday

 <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock plunged Friday amid warnings that the $ 1.1 billion paid for its theme parks would do little to relieve the publisher's debt. <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON>'s stock price dropped more than 25 percent on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, falling $ 4.12 -LCB- a share to $ 12.12 -LCB-. The Orlando-based textbook publisher took on $ 2.9 billion in debt to fend off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by British communications mogul <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, and analysts say it now finds itself squeezed to pay off the interest. Analysts had hoped Orlando-based <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> would get $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion for the four <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and two other parks it sold to <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. on Thursday The $ 1.1 billion sale price will net <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> about $ 930 million. `` I think people's expectations were too high for the selling price of the theme parks,'' <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> first announced the intended sale, the company's stock soared from $ 10 to $ 18 <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said the sale would lower <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON>'s $ 346.6 million in annual interest payments by $ 115 million. But the loss of the parks will cut into the income <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> needs to pay the debts; as of June 30, the parks accounted for $ 68.3 million of the company's $ 216.8 million in annual earnings, and that share had been expected to increase. `` They do n't have enough money to pay the interest,'' <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> needs to reduce annual interest payments to under $ 150 million _ either by lowering payments another $ 80 million or selling assets of $ 800 million. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> speculated that <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> could sell its insurance arm, but other analysts said even that will not be enough. `` They do n't have that much more to sell. Ultimately, they will have to issue more equity,'' says <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. That will help reduce the debt but will dilute share values even further, he said. `` We're still recommending selling the stock,'' <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> said. `` We think it's worth somewhere near $ 8 to $ 9 a share.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Friday approved the proposed sale of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> line between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, a major step in the carrier's reorganization. The deal, which still must be approved by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, would give the route to <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a railroad company in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that has been seeking a foothold in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Under the proposal, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> would pay $ 22 million and assume $ 7 million of <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W debt owed to various state agencies. <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> told the government it would eliminate 187 of the 360 CM & amp; W jobs on the line. `` Whatever happens in bankruptcy court will probably happen soon because <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W is in a tough cash position,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, attorney for <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. The route is used mainly for freight, but <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> also uses it to run three daily round-trip runs between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and two between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. In making its decision, the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> considered objections from competing railroads, including <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Both handle freight for railroads owned by <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> _ business they are likely to lose if the deal is approved in bankruptcy court and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> gains access to the line. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> said it would lose $ 7.2 million per year. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> was not swayed. `` We conclude that the ... acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W's line ... will not result in a substantial lessening of competition, creation of a monopoly or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in the region,'' the order said. `` The transfer will also assure continued operation by <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> over its third heaviest volume line. ... The state has made a substantial investment in the line,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Sale to -LRB- <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> -RRB- will secure this investment.'' Under the proposed deal with <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W would still retain its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Mo.-East <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> route; track between <LOCATION> Greene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>; a 50 percent interest in the <LOCATION> Godfrey-East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> line, and all locomotives and cars. CM & amp; W was created in 1986 to be an independent regional railroad. In April 1988, the railroad filed for bankruptcy reorganization and the case is pending before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Creditors, primarily <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Heller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are owed more than $ 100 million. They want immediate liquidation of the railroad, while <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, the court-appointed trustee, supports the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> deal. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> decision.

 Fewer Americans made late payments on their bank and home mortgage loans in the April-June quarter, two trade associations reported this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said 4.52 percent of outstanding mortgage loans on one-to-four-unit residential properties were more than 30 days past due, down from 4.62 percent in the in the first quarter. It was second consecutive quarterly decline and the lowest level in 10 years, the trade group said. The foreclosure rate blipped up from 0.32 percent in the first quarter to 0.37 percent in the second. The association, noting that the foreclosure rate generally follows the trend of the delinquency rate, said it expected that foreclosures to fall. The MBA surveyed 13.5 million loans, representing about a third of all outstanding mortgages. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the delinquency rate on installment loans at commercial banks fell to 2.30 percent at the end of the April-June period, down from 2.39 percent at the end of March and 2.49 percent at the end of December. The percentage represents a composite for seven different types of loans: personal, direct auto, indirect auto, mobile home, recreational vehicle, property improvement and home equity. Although the economy's growth has slowed this year, analysts take the falling delinquency rates as a sign that consumer income and employment are still strong. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> surveys loans in all 50 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.
