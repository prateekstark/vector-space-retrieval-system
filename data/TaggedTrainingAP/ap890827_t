<HEAD>Egypt and Jordan Call For Syria To Cooperate With Arab League</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on Sunday urged <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to cooperate with an Arab league committee appointed to mediate an end to conflict in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that has left nearly 800 people in less than six months. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> met with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for three hours of talks on regional issues, principally the escalating violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between Christian troops and Syrian-backed Moslems. The latest round in the conflict broke out in March when <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, blockaded illegal Moslem-run ports. The Syrians responded by blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said he hoped `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would cooperate with'' a three-member Arab League committee of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> appointed in a May Arab summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> to mediate peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Must not leave the solution for what is happening in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to non-Arab countries, because that would make us appear weak,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. `` We as Arabs are responsible for what happens in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> apparently referred to French and Soviet negotiations last week with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem leaders in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s principal weapons supplier. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said, however, it was uncertain whether the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee will be able to carry out its mandate to end to the war. The committee said this month that its efforts had failed and blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for refusing to schedule withdrawal of its estaimted 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We must wait and see whether the committee will continue its work or not,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate but became involved on the Moslem side of that country's civil war A Jordanian official said in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and other Arab countries were mediating with the Syrians to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s violence. On Saturday, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Sharaa </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have no diplomatic ties, but relations have improved recently after 10 years of bitterness that followed <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>

 Hurricane Kiko, packing winds up to 115 mph, hit the southeastern coast of the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peninsula Saturday, blowing down trees and unleashing downpours, officials said. The storm lashed <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION> and other small towns on the coast of the sparsely populated <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> state. `` The wind is very strong. There's a lot of water. There are trees down. But there have been no casualties,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, public security director in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION>, said of <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. About 4,000 people live in the town and surrounding area, he said. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> is about 75 miles south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, the state capital. `` The eye is brushing along the southeastern edge'' of the peninsula, approximately between the town of <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barriles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said by telephone. <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION> is about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barriles </LOCATION> lies between the two cities. At 11 p.m. local time, -LRB- 2 a.m. EDT Sunday -RRB- the storm was located near latitude 23.9 north and longitude 109.7 west, or about 40 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. It was moving northwest at about 5 mph, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The weather bulletin said <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> made landfall but did not say when. The storm expected to lose strength as it crossed the peninsula in the next 24 hours, it said. Electricity was off in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rivera </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION>, near the tip of the peninsula, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said the few hotels along the coast around <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> had not been evacuated. `` They are the type of construction that can take it,'' he said. Waves more than 10 feet high were crashing on the coast in <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION>, a town of 800 people, said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Marron </PERSON>, the security and transit agent on duty. Many people who were staying in the town's three hotels took the Saturday morning plane to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said. Heavy rain fell afternoon, rushing down normally dry gullies, he said. He said about four families who live along a gully in <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION> had been told they should leave their homes. A strong wind was blowing about 7 p.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT -RRB-, and some residents had taped or boarded up windows, he said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> was a `` small'' hurricane with sustained winds up to 115 mph Saturday night. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, with 160,000 inhabitants, has half the population of the state, which occupies the southern half of the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. It is about 760 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zatarain </PERSON> said emergency supplies were being mustered and shelters stocked with food and blankets throughout the state. Storm warnings were being broadcast, civil defense units had been mobilized and military units were standing by, he said. Ferry service between the peninsula and the mainland was canceled, he said. On the mainland, the <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state government had an emergency plan in effect, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. The airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> canceled or diverted service to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> on Saturday after making an early morning flight to the three cities, the reservations office said.

 Hurricane Kiko slammed into the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peninsula with 115 mph winds that blew down homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate, but it lost strength Sunday as it passed over hilly terrain. After striking the southeastern coast of the peninsula and driving toward the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, the storm's top sustained winds fell to 90 mph by 5 a.m. -LRB- 8 a.m. EDT -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> bore down hardest on <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a city of 4,000 people 75 miles south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> <PERSON> Telechea </PERSON>, assistant state government director. `` There were homes of thin wood and laminated cardboard that blew down,'' he said. `` They had palm or cardboard roofs that blew away. Trees, antennas, electrical poles fell.'' There were no immediate reports of injuries, but more than 300 people left their homes and were housed in shelters in the area, officials said. Sgt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgoin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, the police officer on duty in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION>, said 20 homes were destroyed in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rivera </LOCATION>, which is in his district. At 5 a.m., the storm was located near latitude 23.7 north and longitude 110.5 west, or 35 miles south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. The capital of <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is 760 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The storm was moving west at about 5 mph, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The weather bulletin said <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> hit the coast at midnight Saturday and lost strength as it struck the coastal cliffs and high terrain of the peninsula. The weather service said hurricane warnings were in effect for the Gulf of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> side of the Baja peninsula from the southern tip northward to <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conception </LOCATION>, 200 miles north of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. They were also declared for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> side south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>, a hurricane specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the worst of <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> is over for <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>. `` The biggest problem is continued heavy rains, flash floods and mudslides,'' he said in a telephone interview early Sunday. `` It should come out over the open waters of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> during the day and resume a west-northwest track, and we expect it to continually weaken as it heads over cooler waters in the next day or two,'' he said. The storm also lashed <LOCATION> Buenavista </LOCATION> and other small towns south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> on the coast of the sparsely populated state and sent water rushing down normally dry gullies, stopping traffic along the highway from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabo </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, officials said. Electricity was out from <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucas </LOCATION>, at the tip of the peninsula, up the coast to towns south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. The lack of power also cut water service since pumps are electric. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabo </ORGANIZATION> public security director, said the few hotels along the coast around <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> had not been evacuated. `` They are the type of construction that can take it,'' he said. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zatarain </PERSON>, the state public security coordinator, said emergency supplies were being mustered and shelters stocked with food and blankets throughout the state.

 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> and the union representing some 4,200 striking workers reached a tentative settlement early Sunday but the workers would stay off the job until their counterparts in other Midwestern states reached settlements, a spokesman said. The settlement came a day after workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> also reached a tentative contract. Both state companies are subsidiaries of the five-state <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> regional telephone company, which has been strikebound since Aug. 13. `` We are still on strike until all -LRB- bargaining -RRB- tables with <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> are resolved,'' <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 4603 </ORGANIZATION> said in a tape recorded message to union members announcing the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vyto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapocius </PERSON> confirmed the settlement but declined to comment further, saying the company would reveal the details at an afternoon news conference. Some 37,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> walked off the job Aug. 13.

<HEAD>Child Turns 7 In Hiding As Custody Fight Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> turned 7 last week in hiding, with her father marking the birthday at a subdued Capitol Hill ceremony and her mother nearing two years in jail for refusing to disclose the little girl's whereabouts. <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> has been missing for two years on Monday, since a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> judge ordered her mother, Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, to surrender the youngster for unsupervised visits with her father. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> refused to comply and remains in jail on contempt of court charges. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> claims that <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s father, Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, sexually abused the girl. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> vehemently denies the allegation and contends that his former wife is suffering from delusions. While the parents' struggle continues, mental health professionals are questioning whether <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> can survive the ordeal without emotional scars. `` For any child, a separation from both parents on an abrupt and sudden basis is very harmful and could cause serious long-term consequences,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> and Adolescent Psychiatry. `` There's no way that she could not be significantly affected from this experience, and I would think that any effects could not be undone.'' <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahrons </PERSON>, a noted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> psychologist in the field of child custody cases and author of the book `` Divorced Families,'' said <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s separation from her parents could leave the child feeling isolated, even under protective custody. `` This is bound to have a profound effect on her,'' <PERSON> Ahrons </PERSON> said. `` If she was close to her parents, she may feel abandoned. In a case like this, the child is the most vulnerable because of her age and because she has no control in what happens to her.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s court-appointed attorney, declined to be interviewed and said she refuses all media requests for interviews concerning this case. She said such interviews `` contribute to the long-term negative impact on <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>.'' District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> will remain in jail for contempt of court until she surrenders <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>. A three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the city's highest local court, ordered that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> be released. However, the entire court overturned that decision on Aug. 21 _ <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s seventh birthday _ and ordered a new hearing on the case before the full court next month. That same day, <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> and about a dozen family members and friends marked his daughter's birthday with a small ceremony on the steps of the Capitol. Legislation passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and awaiting a vote by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would limit the length of contempt jailings in the nation's capital and, in effect, free <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. Later that same day, <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he thinks <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> is suffering through an experience that could ultimately lead to an early death. `` If my daughter is not brought back within the near future, it will be too late. She will lose her ability to ever recover from this,'' he said. `` I knew her to be a resilient child, but at some point that resilience is going to fade. I do n't want my daughter to be an example, another statistic, of a teen-age suicide because she feels abandoned by both parents and has been led to believe that her father is a pervert and her mother is a crazy woman.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> did not respond to a written request for an interview relayed through jail officials. However, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Froning </PERSON>, a child psychologist who treated <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> for two years at her mother's request, said the only hardship that the young girl has undergone is being apart from her mother for so long. `` Her ordeal is being separated from her mother, the only person in the world she trusts,'' Froning said. `` She is with the people she chose to be with, so I have every reason to believe she is safe.'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, however, wondered whether the one-way communication that he presumes <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> receives is n't hurting the girl. `` One presumes she is told positive things about her mother and negative things about her father,'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said. `` That is not constructive, not at all.'' <PERSON> Ahrons </PERSON> said she also was concerned that some problems could result from the girl acting as a fugitive to disguise her real identity. `` There are certainly possible problems with issues concerning her own identity,'' said <PERSON> Ahrons </PERSON>. `` It could have some effect on her life. A profound effect? Who knows?'' <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has his own theory. `` At what point will <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> cease to even know who she is?'' he asked. `` I mean, how many times has her name been changed, has her hair been colored? Does she even know who she is anymore? Her self-image will soon be destroyed, if it has n't already happened.''

 A storm with 55 mph winds and heavy rains caused landslides and flooding Sunday that left two people dead and three missing, police said. Seven people were reported injured by objects thrown by the winds. The storm, earlier designated Typhoon <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, had been downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it hit western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, forecasters said.

 A macabre drama unfolded for a small fellowship who, with horror and fascination, watched television film clips of the first clear pictures of the wreck of the <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. `` Oh yes, I've watched it. I ca n't not watch it,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, whose only child, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, 22, died aboard the steel freighter during a fierce storm Nov. 10, 1975. His body and those of 28 other crewmen remain at the bottom of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>. For three days last week, explorers using a submersible robot penetrated the cold, deep water that has cloaked and preserved the Fitzgerald since its sinking. Their video images will provide data on the wreck as well as the technology to study other underwater sites. For the families of the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> crew, the expedition opened wounds. `` People say it gets easier. Naturally, it's eased some. But to me it was just yesterday,'' said <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olmstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Startling footage of the 556-foot-deep wreck _ funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipwreck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> _ was difficult for <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> to watch. `` It's a hard time for me. It brings back all of the panic,'' she said. `` But I ca n't say I do n't want them to do it. I have a lot of friends that are really angry. They ask, ` Why are they doing that to the families?' But this is history. My son would have wanted it shown.'' She feels good about public fascination with the wreck. `` They really have n't forgotten,'' she said. The tragedy became American folklore, particularly after Canadian balladeer <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON> wrote a hit song in 1976 about the death of the boat he called `` the pride of the American side.'' `` All that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters,'' he sang. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> last week that his father, the <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> for whom the the freighter was named, was haunted by the wreck until his death in 1986. The father was president of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which built the ship in 1958. The <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, under threatening skies Nov. 9 on what was to have been its last trip down the Great Lakes before docking for the winter. By the next day, the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> was in a gale. Capt. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> McSorley </PERSON> reported topside damage and a list to his boat as 30-foot waves crashed over the freighter. Just 15 miles short of the protection of <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McSorley </PERSON> spoke by ship's radio to the <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, another freighter struggling through the storm. Although the beacon light that marked the entrance to the bay had gone out, both skippers were sure they'd make it `` We are holding our own,'' <PERSON> McSorley </PERSON> told the <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s crew. Shortly afterward, the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> disappeared from radar screens without even a distress call. No bodies and very little wreckage was found. There are conflicting theories on how the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sank _ whether water entered its hold through leaking hatch covers or it hit a shoal. Underwater divers later found that the ship went down with such force it broke in two. The search robot's first images Wednesday were of a stark white bow rising crumpled and torn out of the blackness. Researchers were struck not by the damage but by the incongruity of a gleaming water cooler surrounded by overturned equipment in the pilothouse. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Peckol </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is eager to see the footage being filmed for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> television show. He's already seen the snippets on newscasts `` Naturally, they're not going to change anything that has happened,'' said <PERSON> Peckol </PERSON>, whose 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>, died on the ship. `` But maybe they can shed more light on what possibly happened.'' <PERSON> Bettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peckol </PERSON> remembers her relief when <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> took a job on the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, transferring from a smaller and, she thought, more dangerous boat named <PERSON> Sensibar </PERSON>. `` The irony of it is, the <PERSON> Sensibar </PERSON> is still sailing,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Peckol </PERSON>, who skipped newscasts of the wreckage. `` I'm not happy about opening up a lot of old wounds. I guess you never forget the loss of a child. `` Plus, I do n't believe in living in the past. I want to remember <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> the way he was the last time I saw him.'' That was Nov. 7, 1975. He was waving goodbye.

 Suppose you have a craving for some `` Bush Sauce'' with your quail dinner. Or maybe you want to snuggle your feet into a pair of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag slippers adorned with <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> dolls. Perhaps you'd just like to pick up a `` Read my lips'' wall clock. <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> is your shopping destination. The proliferation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paraphernalia in this resort town of nearly 3,000 people is giving tourists a variety of souvenir options to prove _ once they get home to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ that they have, indeed, been to the summer vacation home of the 41st president. What kitchen, for example could n't use a little refrigerator magnet with a plastic <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobster and the words `` <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Home of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' on it? Those sell for $ 2.50 each at the What's In Store, a curio shop that also features mugs emblazoned with the eagle symbol of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a picture of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home on <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. In the same shop, you can have your picture taken with a lifesize picture of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for $ 5. Or how about a kid's bib that says `` I was a guest at Walker's Point, <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>,'' or a dishtowel bearing the blue grinning image of the president at $ 4.99 each The president himself gave a plug Friday for a new item selling at the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arundel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> shop. `` You want me to sell some shirts for you?'' he asked golf pro <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynor </PERSON> as they teed off. He turned to a group of reporters and photographers and pointed to the insignia on his knit shirt. `` It says <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. They're really nice. I'm recommending them.'' The `` new presidential shirts'' sell for $ 36 in the golf shop, where photos of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> driving a golf cart adorn the wall. Back in the quaint center of town, all manner of Bush-inspired T-shirts are hot sellers. Slogans emblazoned across shirts include the well-worn `` KenneBushport,'' `` The Summer White House, <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>,'' with a picture of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point home, and `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Sleeps Here.'' For those getting ready for Halloween, the Paper Plus toys and curio store sells cardboard <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> masks, with cutout eyes, for $ 3.95. The masks are displayed on a wall between an autographed photo of comedian Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and a photo of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, smiling in a white negligee and autographed with the words, `` To all my darlings at Paper Plus. I'll always cherish this day.'' The store also sells the `` Sleeping Partnerzzz'' slippers, at $ 30 a pair, which feature plastic <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heads peeping out from flag-striped slippers. Each plastic doll head rests on a pillow, also part of the slipper, emblazoned with the eagle seal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grimaced a few months back when a local restaurateur showed her a pair of the slippers. The Open Door Gift Shop features Bush Sauce, created by The <ORGANIZATION> Hagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> company of neargy Orgunquit, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, at $ 5.25 for a 16-ounce jar. Proprietor <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibber </PERSON> says it's so popular `` I ca n't keep it in. ... It's just a fun item.'' The label says the tomato and onion relish is `` excellent with quail'' and makes a nice garnish for chicken or fish. In keeping with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jargon, one flavor is labeled `` kinder-gentler,'' and the label also urges the shopper to `` Shower your taste buds with a thousand points of light.'' Another Bush-ism inspired a $ 46 clock at the Argo gift shop. The clock is in the shape of bright red lips with a cartoon-style balloon coming from them carrying the words `` Read my lips.'' Proprietor <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Joslyn </PERSON> said he's not really into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paraphernalia but picked up two of the novelty clocks at a craft show. He sent one to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> via the son of a friend who cares for the Bushes' pool. He does n't know if the president received it. Irreverence is the key to some of the novelties. One version of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mask carries the caution: `` Not intended for use by children under the age of 3 or by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. May cause drowsiness while operating heavy machinery, pitching horseshoes, vetoing legislation. ... Misuse may result in 1,000 points of light.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, who runs a corporate and personal shopping service, said her clients are looking for all types of more refined Bush-oriented gifts. `` Everybody wants <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> products with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home painted on them,'' she said adding that a popular item has been a $ 35 breakfast-in-bed tray with <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point on it. The more thrifty souvenir shopper can pick up plastic thimbles, at $ 6.99 each, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s picture on them, or shot glasses, $ 3.95 each, bearing the presidential seal and the words <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON>, contending that <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> has n't let itself be overwhelmed by tackiness, acknowledged that some of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> products are `` borderline tasteful'' and that `` expensive tacky is creeping in.''

<HEAD>Record Lag Expected in Third World Interest Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major Third World countries are expected to fall nearly another $ 5 billion behind in the interest payments and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other banks this year, but, unlike individual debtors, there's no car to repossess and no home to foreclose on. Sovereign governments do not allow foreign bankers to seize the property of their citizens, although sometimes lenders are allowed to buy up pieces of it in debt-equity swaps. Fifteen countries singled out by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for special help will fall behind by another $ 4.868 billion in their interest payments this year, raising their arrears to a record $ 15.079 billion, according to the banks which are owed the money. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owe the most, according figures on the 15 major debtors compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, a group of the leading lending banks, and made available to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week. Bankers know them as `` the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> 15'' after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who made up the list in 1985 when he was secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. Most are in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but the list also includes <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. By the end of 1990, the 15 countries will owe about $ 524 billion to lending banks and governments, with nearly another $ 50 billion in interest payments falling due. Most have not paid anything on the principal of their debt since the crisis began in 1982. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, an economist at the institute, said falling behind on servicing the debt is a conscious policy of Third World government leaders. `` Their governments need capital, and that's the way they decide to get it,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. `` But it's a policy that discourages new lending from abroad and discourages their own citizens from bringing home the money they've sent abroad.'' More money has been leaving Third World countries than has arrived in them this decade. Leaders of the debtor countries complain that the net outflow _ about $ 30 billion last year _ is unnatural and a major cause of their declining standards of living through the 1980s. `` Poverty has increased because of debt,'' said Finance Minister <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidzero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, whose country owes a modest $ 2.5 billion and is not among the 15 major debtors. `` Malnutrition has increased as a result of more money going into debt service,'' <PERSON> Chidzero </PERSON> said. `` There is a decline in social services, because they can not be maintained because people want to service debt. And I think that is an untenable situation.'' The interest payments are cited as a major factor in the net exodus but part of it also is due to their wealthy citizens putting their money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and other safe havens. Much of this `` capital flight'' is illegal, and there are no reliable figures on it. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> thinks that citizens of many debtor countries have stashed away assets abroad that approach or even exceed the value of their own countries' debts to the commercial banks. Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which owes about $ 109 billion and is the Third World's biggest debtor, predicts there will be economic chaos if a solution is not found soon. `` If we do not find a solution for the debt, then it will be solved by itself through political turmoil, through social unrest, and then industrial nations will wake up and find a solution,'' he said. `` So, it is better for them to help us find a solution now.'' Norbrega and <PERSON> Chidzero </PERSON> made their comments on a program prepared by <ORGANIZATION> WETA </ORGANIZATION>, a public television station in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The program will be broadcast Sept. 28 when the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> hold their annual meetings here <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> pose two of the biggest problems. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> already has delayed some payments and the prospects are uncertain that it will make a $ 3 billion payment due next month. Brazilian leaders say they are not planning another stop on payments, but the creditor banks say they expect the country to pile up another $ 700 million of interest arrears this year. Last year <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> caught up on its arrears through an agreement with the private banks and the multigovernment <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. New loans were provided on the condition that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s government reduce its own borrowing at home. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has said that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> failed to live up to the agreement and has halted further disbursement of the new loans. Many private banks followed suit. What happens next depends largely on the results of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s upcoming November election in which the debt burden is a major issue. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, where the new government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is settling in, will owe about $ 68.6 billion at the end of this year, according to the bankers' institute. Of that, $ 5.8 billion represents past-due interest. Total debt of Third World countries is estimated at $ 1.3 trillion. But many big debtors are not considered in financial trouble. Among them are <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, with a $ 60.2 billion; <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with $ 42.4 billion, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with $ 39.3 billion. For the troubled countries, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has achieved a minor breakthrough by getting multigovernment-owned <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to effectively guarantee interest payments on new loans or reduced interest rates proffered by private banks in debt-reduction agreements. So far deals have been struck with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. But it is uncertain how much the arrangements will actually reduce borrowers' debt-service costs. Many fear the debtor nations will be left only further in the red. And some influential governments are skeptical that their taxpayers will be stuck for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> guarantees if and when the deals sour.

 Independence. A year ago, only a few former political prisoners dared whisper the word in the nation's three Baltic republics Today, it is the goal of a mass movement, putting the three tiny lands in direct conflict with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, a 370-mile chain of determined Baltic families stood hand in hand, protesting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of their independent nations. But that was just the most dramatic manifestation of a profound change that has occurred in recent months on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s western frontier. The activist groups of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, once worked for more authority within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now, they are openly calling for restoration of their free nations. `` The declarations of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in the past year have become ever closer to the ideals our people have carried in their hearts for all these 50 years,'' <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader and lawmaker <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON> said. `` All of us would like to have freedom, and freedom without independence is n't realistic,'' she said. From the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s point of view, it is Baltic independence that's unrealistic, and a sharply worded statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday made that point clear. `` Things have gone far. Serious danger is threatening the Baltic peoples,'' the policy-making body said. `` People should know what abyss their nationalist leaders are pushing them toward.'' `` If they managed to attain their goals, the consequences could be catastrophic for their people. Their very ability to survive could come under question,'' it said. The statement was carried on national television. Not long ago, such a warning from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would have sent shudders through many activists. On Sunday, it did little more than raise eyebrows in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> _ yet another indication of how far the region has come in establishing for itself an identity outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We expected this,'' said <PERSON> Raimona </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakalouskis </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian activist group. But leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> movements did n't interrupt their weekend plans to discuss the statement. The radicalization of the fronts is backed by more than 2 million people who signed documents implying they want freedom from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, 1.3 million people have signed petitions saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> annexed their nation `` against the will of Lithuanians.'' It demands removal of the Soviet `` occupation army'' and seeks <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision of free elections for a new Baltic government. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, 430,000 people have registered themselves as desiring to be considered citizens of an independent <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, more than 400,000 have signed petitions asking the Estonian parliament to declare illegal the 1940 Estonian parliament's approval of the Soviet annexation. That legislature was elected under Soviet occupation and only Communists were allowed to run. For the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> are front-line territory, home to missile bases, naval and army units, and vital ports. Activists say one in eight people in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> is a Soviet soldier. Soviet television called the idea of redrawing boundaries `` political naivete'' in its coverage of Wednesday's protest. `` Independence _ it'll never happen,'' said a <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> taxi driver, the son of a Russian-Estonian marriage. The economy is a wreck and hopes of developing a new tourist industry fail to take into consideration the cold, damp Baltic climate, he said. Significant opposition to independence also has come from the 2.7 million Russians and other non-Baltic people among the 8 million Baltic residents. Yet amid the pride and determination exhibited by the tens of thousands of Estonians holding hands on the crest of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Toompea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday evening, independence seemed possible In the past year, the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> have waged a parliamentary and legal struggle, taking full advantage of each step toward democracy permitted by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Each move has run into condemnation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, giving way to grudging acceptance, and a new push by the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> made international headlines in November when it claimed the right to overturn Soviet laws. The Kremlin declared the move invalid, but <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has not backed down. A plan for economic autonomy greeted with derision two years ago has been approved in principle by the new Soviet legislature. Recent strikes by Russians in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> over a voter residency law disturbed activists, but the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> refrained from issuing orders and strove for a peaceful compromise. <PERSON> Alvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON>, a leader of the Lithuanian activist group <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, said it would not now exist if it had spoken of independence even in January. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> council pushed again. It voted to call for `` creation of an independent democratic Lithuanian republic not under the power of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' A day earlier, the Lithuanian parliament passed a resolution calling the Soviet annexation `` an international crime.'' In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will take a formal vote soon at its congress on changing its platform to full independence, said Chairman <PERSON> Ianis </PERSON> <PERSON> Freimanis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Lightning A More Widespread Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have found lightning to be an even more widespread danger than was believed, with more than five dozen Americans losing their lives and hundreds more injured by lightning last year. A hazard whose scattered victims usually attract only local notice, lightning finally made the national headlines in 1988 by sparking forest fires that ravaged much of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, weather observers have recorded the presence of lightning through the simple expedient of listening for the thunder that comes after the electrical discharges. But electromagnetic detection systems have discovered that, because of interference with sound waves, between 22 percent and 40 percent of all lightning occurs without observers hearing the thunder that follows. That is not good news, researchers note, pointing out that lightning can strike with no warning, sometimes occuring prior to storms or reaching out ahead of the clouds. Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s, but they have always depended on the reports of trained observers, primarily listening to thunder. This means that the operators of electrical plants and others who use weather records to anticipate the danger of lightning have underestimated the risk. The toll of 68 lightning deaths in 1988 was the same number as in 1986, tying for the lowest in this decade. In between, however, 1987 recorded the most in the decade with 86 fatalities. The long-term average is 96 lightning deaths annually, an average boosted by several very deadly years back in the 1960s, including 1963 when 210 people were killed by lightning. As usual, in 1988 many victims were in the open or under trees, with several on golf courses or in boats. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> retained its place as leading in lightning deaths with nine, while six died in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. There were four lightning deaths in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. And states with three fatalities were <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> had two lightning deaths each. States reporting one fatality last year were <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. More than half of all electrical storms had only a few cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, while a small number of storms had hundreds of strokes. Indeed, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, three years worth of records showed that nearly one-quarter of all the lightning strokes were accounted for in just two big storms. One reason lightning does n't get the respect that meteorologists think it deserves is that it is like automobile accidents, usually claiming victims one or two at a time over a scattered area. The sudden arrival of thousands of volts of electricity, however, can sometimes involve a lot of people. For example, on July 17, 1988, lightning struck a utility pole at a speedway in <LOCATION> Snyder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Twenty-two spectators were injured by the charge which traveled down the pole and into the bleachers Happily, no one was killed. On July 10 of last year a group playing volleyball in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Prospect Park was n't so fortunate Seeking to avoid a sudden downpour, they sought shelter under a tree. Lightning struck, killing a 28-year-old man and injuring a dozen others. Lightning results from a buildup of electrical charges in a storm cloud. The process is n't fully understood, but is appears to involve movement of raindrops up and down in the cloud, propelled by strong winds. When the electrical charges build up to large levels an invisible `` step leader'' moves down from the negatively charged cloud base in segments about 50 yards long, until it reaches the positively charged ground. When that contact is made, thousands of volts of electricity move in that circuit _ often in several `` bolts'' giving lightning its sometimes flickering character.

<TEXT>
 A fundamentalist church group improperly spent $ 117,000 earmarked for a low-income housing project here and tried to evade government rules in order to sell the building at an enormous profit, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records and court documents show. The sale of The Concord, a 150-unit high-rise building, was halted through the persistence of tenants who feared they would be evicted or their rents would triple, lawyers familiar with the case said. The tenants urged the inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an audit, which found $ 117,787 in project funds were improperly spent by The Concord's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> Among other things, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> found that <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> funds were used to pay church group officers and purchase two vans used for church events. The housing agency eventually reached a settlement with the group on the misspent money. The Glendale-based fundamentalist group first tried to sell the apartment building in 1982 for $ 5.5 million, after paying off the balance of a $ 2.05 million <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan to the original developer. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has since prohibited pre-payment of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loans unless the housing secretary finds that existing tenants are protected from eviction or higher rents. Community Churches tried again in 1985 to sell the building for $ 5.5 million, under the protection of a bankruptcy reorganization. But the bankruptcy sale was blocked after objections were raised by tenants, church creditors and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, according to court records on file in nearby <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Community Churches was headed by the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McBirnie </PERSON>, a charismatic preacher. Community Churches acquired The Concord in 1979 and organized a non-profit foundation to run the building in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations. The building was erected in 1966 to provide subsidized housing for the elderly and handicapped. But there were problems from the outset, said <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 81, a former building manager who spearheaded the tenants' fight. McBirnie planned to use the <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> to house his own parishioners and the loyal listeners to his anti-communist radio broadcasts, `` Voice of Americanism,'' she said. By 1982, <PERSON> McBirnie </PERSON> decided to sell The Concord because `` we were constantly being frustrated at making improvements in the building and not being able to do the good work that we had intended,'' he said in a legal declaration. He did not return a reporter's telephone call seeking comment <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s `` decision to allow the prepayment was very suspect,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer representing the building's tenants. After the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan was repaid, the agency lost its regulatory control over the building. Even the church's lawyer, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON>, acknowledged, `` The idea of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> authorizing this prepayment for the benefit of a private owner was a real political hot potato at the time.'' Tenants asked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> about the legality of the sale, and were told <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations did not prohibit Community Churches group from paying off its loan early, Mrs. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Of course, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> `` was concerned over the impact upon existing tenants,'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> wrote Mrs. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> in July 1982. `` We insisted upon an agreement by the project owners that all existing tenants would have the opportunity to remain in occupancy without interference by the -LRB- new -RRB- owner until such time as they may freely choose to leave.'' But in testimony about a week later before the House Select Committee on Aging, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> conceded the sale was authorized before <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> received any written pledge from <PERSON> McBirnie </PERSON>'s group guaranteeing the residents' life tenancy. `` The primary concern of the tenants was that they were going to be evicted or that their rents were going to be raised so high they were going to have to leave,'' <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said. `` But that was never reflected in reality.'' In August 1982, Mrs. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and other tenants filed suit to block the sale of The Concord. There was intense pressure to settle because McBirnie's groups had obtained a short-term loan at high interest to pay off the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan, <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said. McBirnie's groups had used the short-term loan because they intended to sell the building immediately, but their plan was thwarted by the tenants' lawsuit, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. `` The deal essentially was shoved down the foundation's throat, because it was either lose the building through foreclosure or accept the government's offer,'' <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said. As a result, a 1983 settlement was reached that included a new $ 2.6 million <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan on the building and again HUD-imposed rules on its operations. New trouble surfaced in May 1985 when a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a $ 1.28 million default judgment against McBirnie's church groups in a suit that alleged 26 people were defrauded after investing about $ 200,000 in loans for new church facilities. Eventually, 380 creditors filed lawsuits claiming they were owed as much as $ 3.7 million. The next month, Community Churches filed for bankruptcy reorganization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, eventually listing The <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> as a major asset. In the bankruptcy proceeding, <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> proposed to satisfy creditors by selling The Concord to the same buyer lined up in the 1982 deal. The resurrected sale of The Concord in bankruptcy court `` was just a transparent attempt to do in bankruptcy court what the civil suits and the congressional hearings had prevented earlier,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. After the case was transferred to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the bankruptcy court appointed an independent trustee to supervise the reorganization. Three more years of legal maneuvering ended July 31 with a deal that closed the sale of The Concord for $ 1.35 million and assumption of the $ 2.2 million remaining on the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan. The new owner, the <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, has pledged to operate the building according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Sunday that the nation's historic political and economic reforms will collapse unless Poles' living standards improve within six months to a year. `` Society's patience has its limits. It is so bad that if there is no visible effect -LRB- of reform -RRB- in half-a-year to a year then everything will collapse,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` In my opinion they -LRB- Poles -RRB- will not stand any more of it,'' he said. He said another wave of strikes could result, or society could lose confidence in the Solidarity labor movement's ability to initiate change. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he issued the same warning during a meeting in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Sunday with <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s labor and social affairs minister. The new Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the first non-Communist leader of a Soviet bloc nation, has been urging Western nations to increase economic investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met Saturday with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kansas, and his wife, Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and gave them a letter for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seeking more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid than the $ 119 million already promised. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is beset by chronic food shortages and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. The nation has begun free-market reforms, such as relaxing price controls, that in the short term are likely to result in a drop in living standards. Solidarity, by luring Western aid, is seeking to make the tough sacrifices needed to bail out the economy as palatable as possible. After a Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a crowd in the courtyard: `` We must solve all our problems without economic losses.'' Solidarity leaders have been seeking a $ 10 billion assistance package from Western countries that includes investments, credits and rescheduling of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s debt. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who assumed office last week, spent his first days in office meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet and West German officials. The Soviets have expressed support for the Solidarity-led government after previously voicing concerns about the role of the Communists in the new government and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s place in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance. Solidarity has said it will allow the Communists to control the important defense and interior ministries and to have full participation in the new government. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> is expected to announce a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> within a week. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was elected prime minister after Solidarity-backed candidates trounced Communist candidates in parliamentary elections, then formed a coalition with two smaller parties to gain control of the legislature. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he discussed German-Polish relations with <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON>. The 50th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is on Sept. 1. In his sermon at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s, Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> called for Polish-German reconciliation. After Mass, <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> addressed a crowd of 2,500 people in the courtyard and around the church premises. A band played the Polish and West German national anthems. `` You -LRB- Poles -RRB- can be proud of our nation because man does not live only on bread. The Gdansk shipyard and <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> are connected with the notion of freedom. You can be proud of it,'' <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> told the crowd. `` I hope your premier can prove he can make a better country than the Communists,'' <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> said. He also appealed for forgiveness from the Poles. `` A nation without history is a people without memory. We must not forget about suffering. We beg you for forgiveness. Let us embrace you ... No more war, no more violence, no more exile,'' he said. The Solidarity leader is planning to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Sept. 5-8 at the invitation of the Federation of West German Trade Unions.

 Israeli jets bombed a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem stronghold in southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Sunday, killing one guerrilla and wounding five others, police reported. The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said a a statement that its main base in the village of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Suar </PERSON> `` sustained extensive damage'' in the attack at sundown. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, military officials reported destroying the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stronghold and said all Israeli planes returned safely. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement said `` there were material and human losses in the raid'' without giving specific casualty figures. But police in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the body of at least one <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla and five wounded men were taken to the port city's <LOCATION> al-Rai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Suar </PERSON> is 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> near the northern edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The attack was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ninth air raid in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. The last air strike was on June 21 when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jets pounded a base of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Syrian-backed Palestinian group, in the village of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Sunday's air raid is believed to come in retaliation for the Aug. 9 suicide car bomb attack carried out by the Iranian-supported <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. That attack occurred in a south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> strip of land along the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has declared its security zone. Five Israeli soldiers and an allied Lebanese militiaman were injured in the car bombing, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have vowed to avenge the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, has said it carried out the bombing to avenge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Israeli commandos seized <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in a southern Lebanese village on July 28. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said it abducted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in order to win the release of three Israeli servicemen missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1986.

<HEAD>Italian Restaurants Attract Biggest Tippers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Waiters in Italian restaurants in this country get the biggest tips from customers while those in Mexican eateries fare the worst, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has found. The average tip in Italian restaurants in 1986 was 15.8 percent, compared with 15 percent in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurants and 14.8 percent in <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> restaurants, according to an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> study. On the other hand, patrons in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurants were more likely to leave a tip _ 90 out of every 100 did _ than in Italian restaurants, where only 88 saw fit to leave something. In restaurants serving Mexican food there were 86 tips for every 100 customers. The study did not try to give any reason for the differences, nor did it ask about restaurants that serve the foods of other countries. At least one waiter at a small <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, a popular <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> restaurant area, agreed that he got better tips there than in other places he had worked. `` It's the European atmosphere,'' explained <PERSON> Mouez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemni </PERSON>, who comes not from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> but from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, on the other side of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` There's the European flair. People like the atmosphere and it relaxes them. It does n't even matter about the food. I do n't like Italian food much myself _ I think French food is much better.'' At a bigger and pricier Italian place, the maitre d' was not so sure about high tips. `` Some people come in here with a couple of kids and leave a dollar,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>. `` About 20 to 25 percent do n't leave anything.'' A waiter at a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> restaurant would not agree that his tips were inferior. `` It's a matter of food and service,'' he insisted, a little stiffly. `` If a customer gets good food and good service, he tips well.'' What started the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> investigation is that waiters are required by law to include tips in their earnings and pay income tax on them. `` Underreporting of tip income has long been a concern,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> researcher, wrote in his report on the situation. So the service hired the Survey Research Laboratory of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> to query its panel of nearly 13,000 households, both families and individuals. They kept records of their tips over two-week periods between 1983 and 1986. `` The diary approach used in this study was adopted on the ground that tipping information obtained from people leaving tips is likely to be more accurate than data obtained from tip recipients,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Before narrowing the survey down to ethnic restaurants, the study tried other classifications, with labels that included `` family-type restaurants'' and `` atmosphere @ specialty restaurants.'' That turned out to be too vague. People tipped more in restaurants that accepted credit cards and those that served alcohol. Patronage at what the report called `` tip-type'' restaurants declined between 1983 and 1986, but tipping stayed level. There was a shift to establishments where people do not normally leave tips. `` Total eat-in and carryout occasions at hamburger, pizza and chicken places increased from 4.06 million in 1983 to 4.77 million in 1986, an increase of more than 17 percent,'' the study said.

<HEAD>Austrian Authorities Say 180 More East Germans Crossed from Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Austrian officials on Sunday said about 180 East Germans had crossed the Hungarian border in a 24-hour period, despite increased attempts by Hungarian officials to stop them. In <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that Hungarian officials told their West German counterparts that there was rising Soviet and East German concern about the stream of East Germans fleeing through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials, meanwhile, told West German radio that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had repeated assurances that no East German now in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would be sent back against his will. Austrian police officials in <LOCATION> Eisenstadt </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of the border, said that new refugees were arriving despite Hungarian attempts to keep cars with East German license plates away from the boundary, the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The officials were quoted as saying about 180 had crossed since Saturday. All East German cars approaching Nagycenk, two miles east of the border and 20 miles south of <PERSON> Eisenstadt </PERSON>, were being turned back by police, several refugees were quoted as saying. East Germans frustrated with the lack of domestic political or economic reforms and unable to emigrate legally to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> began fleeing through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> early this summer. Their final goal is <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which considers them citizens. The border between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is relatively easy to cross. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a reform-minded Soviet bloc country, removed barbed wire and other barriers from the border in April in a symbolic opening to the West. Because <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is an allied Communist country, East Germans can visit relatively easily. West German authorities estimate that more than 5,000 have fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since July. Hundreds of others refuse to leave West German diplomatic property in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> unless guaranteed safe passage to the West. Like-minded East Germans are crowding West German embassies, consulates and missions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, facing pressure from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, tightened controls after East Germans massed in groups of as many as 500 and stormed border points. Authorities in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> announced Friday that border guards would be bolstered by armed units of the Workers' Militia. But <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is also interested in West German support as it strives to improve its trading status with West European countries and seeks convertible currency to modernize its economy. Hungarian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> late Saturday his government can not guarantee East German officials that all those caught trying to escape through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will be returned home. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> spoke after returning from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, where he and Hungarian Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> met with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the talks focused on Hungarian trade ties to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and on the refugee problem. The refugee situation has resulted in months of bad publicity for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> told West German officials that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was under increasing pressure from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to resolve the problem. The paper did not elaborate. The newspaper said Hungarian officials estimate that about 20,000 of the 200,000 East Germans now vacationing in the country will seek to flee to the West. West German officials have urged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line leadership to implement economic and political reforms to help stem the flow of fleeing East Germans.

<TEXT>
 Security forces will begin stopping people on the streets and checking their identification papers in a new effort to round up dissidents, the official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said Sunday. Starting Friday, residents must carry identification papers whenever they leave home `` to be prepared for examination,'' the paper said. Drivers licenses also will be examined. `` Counter-revolutionary elements have not been thoroughly cleaned up and motor vehicles often are used as tools of crimes,'' the paper said. `` Therefore the martial law troops and police must, according to the law, stengthen inspections of motor vehicles and drivers.'' The order runs counter to a recent, although gradual, lessening of the security presence on streets of the capital since the June 3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. Martial law imposed May 20 remains in effect, but most army checkpoints on city streets have been removed. Soldiers stand guard only around Tiananmen Square, the former center of the protests, and at key overpasses and intersections. However, local authorities appear concerned that college students and others who joined the seven weeks of demonstrations will use the Oct. 1 anniversary of 40 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule to stage some kind of protest. Public anger over the army attack on the protesters _ in which hundreds or perhaps thousands were killed _ remains deep, although most people remain outwardly quiescent for fear of arrest or censure. Thousands of people have been arrested since the June crackdown, some disappearing with no word to their families. The hard-line officials who led the crackdown have shown no sign of easing their attacks on the ideological front. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON> instructed local officials in a series of meetings last week to keep up the fight against `` bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western liberal thought. They ordered leaders in all work units to `` mobilize the masses to make reports and expose clues -LRB- to the identification of -RRB- counter-revolutionary elements. `` The greatest danger in inspection work is to pause, to treat big matters as small and let small matters go, to give up half way,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told one meeting, according to a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily report. `` Our party and nation still face a life-and-death problem.'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents say there have been relatively few cases of neighbors reporting on neighbors, as was common in the 1966-76 leftist Cultural Revolution and earlier political campaigns. They say many work units are quietly covering for members who took part in the protests, and even some police are reported to be dragging their feet in making arrests. National party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> and Education Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieying </PERSON> showed concern about the mood on campuses by visiting students at one of the capital's leading schools, <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Sunday's national and local newspapers quoted <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> as assuring a group of <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> students in a four-hour meeting Friday that the party's current policy of classing intellectuals among the working class would not change. During the first decades of Communist rule, intellectuals were not classed with workers but were instead vilified as bourgeois. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said most students are fervent patriots, but said they lack political experience and too easily become conceited over their successes and discouraged over obstacles. A college student interviewed recently in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said the despite the appearance of normalcy, people are scared. `` There's no law any more, no legal protection. They can just come and take you away,'' said the student. Many say they fear the soldiers. Others fear the telephone hotlines and the boxes in every work unit to report people to the authorities. One man noted that any one could put a neighbor's name in a box and accuse him of throwing stones at soldiers, and the police would come to arrest him. He, like many other people, told of friends who were hauled away, beaten and interrogated. `` The police beat first and ask questions later,'' he said. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents also worry about the miles of footage shot during the weeks of demonstrations by police crews and cameras mounted on main streets. Police now are studying the film, and many people wonder if their faces will be found. One elderly man, persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, was asked by a foreigner how the police could find a single person in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s population of about 10 million. He waved his hand and looked away impatiently _ to show what a silly question that was.

<HEAD>Hurricane Weakens to Tropical Storm Over Baja Mountains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hurricane Kiko pounded the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peninsula early Sunday, wrecking about 20 homes and forcing more than 1,000 people to evacuate before weakening to a tropical storm, officials said. The storm struck the tip of the peninsula at midnight Saturday with 115-mph winds and heavy rains. However, it began weakening as it hit coastal cliffs and moved over the mountainous terrain. The storm was expected to keep fading, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said Sunday. It was downgraded to a tropical storm. <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON>'s maximum sustained winds had fallen to 60 mph by 11 a.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB-. It was located at latitude 24.0 north and longitude 110.4 west near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, about 760 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and it was expected to remain mostly stationary for 12 to 24 hours, the weather service said. About 160,000 people live in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, the capital of the state of <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>. About 1,300 people, mostly from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, were evacuated into shelters statewide as a precautionary measure, said Lt. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> <PERSON> Telechea </PERSON>, assistant state government director, by telephone Sunday from the capital. He said airports and ports remained closed and there were no flights or ferry service. Hurricane warnings were discontinued, but tropical storm warnings remained in effect on the Gulf of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> side of the peninsula from the southern tip to <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION>, 200 miles north of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, and on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> side south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>. The storm hit <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a town of about 4,000 people 75 miles south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, first and hardest. Officials said about 20 homes were destroyed there. `` There were homes of thin wood and laminated cardboard that blew down,'' <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said. `` They had palm or cardboard roofs that blew away. Trees, antennas, electrical poles fell.'' No one was injured, he said. Other small towns south of La Paz were also hit by heavy rains and flash floods, officials said. Electricity was knocked out from <LOCATION> Cabo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucas </LOCATION>, at the tip of the peninsula, up the coast to towns south of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. The power failures meant electric pumps that provide water service were also out.

 It's a bug-eat-bug world for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Blehm </PERSON> and son. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Blehm </PERSON> breed good insects to eat bad insects at <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitova </PERSON>, one of a group of 15 `` insectaria'' nationwide. Every day, <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> produces more than 80 million voracious critters from ladybugs to wasps. Business at <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitova </PERSON> has tripled in the past five years as farmers concerned about the effects of pesticides are turning to natural alternatives. In 1988 alone, the Blehms say, they supplied millions of dollars worth of natural predators to customers across three continents. The 15 insectaria have sales totaling $ 25 million annually, the Blehms estimate. Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, plus back yard farmers. Some colleges and universities are adding classes on integrated pest management _ ways of holding down troublesome pests while minimizing the use of pesticides. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecologists </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, is producing a video that shows farmers how to work with beneficial insects. `` This is the future,'' added <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, a professor of entomology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` There is a great need. The farmers are desperate.'' State agriculture officials estimate less than 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s growers use the method. Controlling pests with beneficial insects takes longer. And because pesticides kill good bugs along with bad, farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying while waiting for the good bugs to do their duty. `` The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith,'' <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Blehm </PERSON> said. `` He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's used to a quick knockdown `` With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before you see a difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is that his crop is contaminated with bugs.'' <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitova </PERSON> sells 15 species including beetles, mites and parasitic wasps that help control flies around chickens and cattle. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Blehm </PERSON>, a licensed pest control adviser, provided the business and production expertise. His partner, E.J. <PERSON> Dietrick </PERSON>, an entomologist formerly with the biological control division at <ORGANIZATION> UC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION>, provided the field know-how. The company employs about 40 workers during peak season from April to September. The insects are grown in a series of former ship cargo containers. <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitova </PERSON> even sells bugs to movie makers. Last summer, a studio filming a horror movie placed a request for four gallons of maggots. `` We shipped them <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> to their location site in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Blehm </PERSON> said. More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced into <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest populations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding and releasing them.

<HEAD>Noriega Hangs On Despite U.S. Pressure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Panamanian government, which has resisted every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to oust de facto ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, is making new claims that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is preparing to invade. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said Saturday there is a `` true danger'' of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> Speaking to reporters, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has used military maneuvers allowed under the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaties </ORGANIZATION> to shield its preparations. `` If all the preliminary steps to an invasion have been taken, the only thing left is the definitive step,'' he said without elaborating. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to dislodge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for 18 months. It has indicted the general for drug trafficking, slapped crippling economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and tried to muster diplomatic support from other Latin American countries. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressures will continue,'' said an embassy official on condition of anonymity. `` There can be no accommodation with a regime that includes <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frozen Panamanian government assets in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and withheld more than $ 300 million in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> funds. The Panamanian government now has trouble meeting payrolls, unemployment is more than 20 percent, and economic activity has fallen by nearly a third. `` This is a government that survives by lurching from one payday to the next,'' said one American source. In addition, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s domestic opponents have mounted general strikes and huge demonstrations. International observers say the opposition beat <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate in May presidential elections that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annuled. Despite the pressure, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has remained in power and even scored some diplomatic victories. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the lack of progress in its negotiations on a Sept. 1 change of government. The organization did not even mention <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by name. The defiant general survived a March coup and purged the Defense Forces of disloyal elements. He has wrapped himself in a nationalist banner and profited from the strong Latin American aversion to anything that smacks of outside interference _ especially from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Saturday, the government took the offensive against its domestic opponents, closing three opposition party newspapers. It also said it will arrest their editors and confiscate equipment used to publish them. All the papers have called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. The big question is what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do now. According to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the attempt to oust him is a thinly disguised plot for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to renege on the 1977 treaties that turn the Panana Canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. If anything, the 51-year-old general appeared more relaxed than ever when he showed up for an agricultural fair on a military base about 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last week. Dressed in civilian clothes, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> drank beer with fairgoers and strolled around, greeting crowds of well-wishers. His power base is the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which controls everything from traffic to city police to customs. It even acts as local government in many small towns, dispensing municipal largesse such as roads and other public works projects. The 14,000-man Defense Forces is the only armed Panamanian authority in the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has said all options are on the table when it comes to removing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, has about 12,000 troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under the canal treaties. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, has said he favors military action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and he has stepped up the pace of military maneuvers. `` We will continue to reaffirm our rights under the terms of the Canal Treaties and to defend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lives and property and let the chips fall where they may,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Chief of Mission <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maisto </PERSON> in an interview. Several times in the past few months, <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers have pointed weapons at each other, alleging violations of the treaties. `` I would not discount a desperate suicide action by <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> before Sept. 1,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It could be a military invasion or a terrorist act.'' The Noriega-controlled government is expected to form a junta to take over Sept. 1, the date the constitution says a new president should take office. The opposition, in what <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called a `` historic stupidity,'' has refused to take part in any junta, demanding <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure and recognition that it won the May 7 elections.

 Two British men hiking in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s rugged <LOCATION> Karakorum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> range spotted a low-flying aircraft near the area where a passenger plane disappeared, an airline spokeswoman said Sunday The <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> twin-engine Fokker-27 with 54 people on board has been missing since early Friday, when it took off from the northern mountain village of <LOCATION> Gilgit </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, 175 miles south. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the trekkers, arrived in <LOCATION> Gilgit </LOCATION> early Sunday and told of seeing a low-flying plane near the 26,606-foot Naked Mountain on Friday, said airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Azra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>. `` We have been following a lot of leads but this looks the most promising,'' she said. `` Naked Mountain is the highest mountain in the Karakorum range. It's the one climbers go out to conquer.'' The airline's Cpt. <PERSON> Qasim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> said that if weather permits Monday, helicopters will drop five people, including the two mountain climbers, on a glacier about 16,000 feet up Naked Mountain. Aircraft have been scanning the mountain range for the past 72 hours. The airline said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McGorrian </PERSON>, a freelance jounalist from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was aboard the aircraft, which was carrying 49 passengers and five crew members. Airline chairman <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Pota </PERSON> told a news conference investigators have not ruled out sabotage or a hijacking, but he said both appear unlikely. The 27-year-old plane was equipped with an emergency locator transmitter but it has to be activated manually by survivors. No signals have been picked up in the area, said <ORGANIZATION> Pota </ORGANIZATION>. None of <ORGANIZATION> PIA </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of 11 Fokker-27s is equipped with an automatic locator, he said. Deteriorating weather hampered search efforts Sunday. A thick cloud cover blanketed the valleys of the Karakorum, said airline spokesman <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarooqi </PERSON>. `` We have seen many a tragedy in this area, both for <ORGANIZATION> PIA </ORGANIZATION> and the military,'' he said. Four aircraft _ a Fokker-27, a DC-3 and two military C-130s _ have crashed in the area since 1963. `` It's very treacherous and inhospitable terrain,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pota </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first beauty queen says her fantasy of being named the country's most beautiful woman has turned into an ugly nightmare of threats and blackmail by unscrupulous organizers. Organizers of the <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> pageant have threatened to strip her of the title and send another contestant to the Miss World contest if she does n't knuckle under to their contract demands, which 17-year-old <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> termed `` bondage.'' `` In three months of torment I have lived through so many humiliations, disappointments and accusations that I'm simply amazed I have n't lost my mind,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said in a letter published Sunday in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> said the director of the Venets organization refused to allow her to bring a chaperone on any travels abroad with him because he wanted to be alone with her. She also accused him of blocking business offers from the West from reaching her, and of sabotaging the one deal she managed to put together herself. Miss <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON>, who said she wants a career in advertising, was chosen as the first <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> from among 35 contestants by a panel of judges and by a television audience, which voted by telephone. Before the pageant's final on May 21, the Venets organization ` insisted, by way of threats and blackmail, that the girls sign an agreement of bondage, limiting their rights and legal capabilities,'' Miss <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> wrote. Some of the contestants refused to sign, but she did, she said. However, after she won, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> and her mother went to <LOCATION> Venets </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kushnerev </PERSON> and said the contract was invalid because she is a minor. They offered to negotiate a new contract under which her mother and a long-time acquaintance would travel with her until she reaches 18. She accused <PERSON> Kushnerev </PERSON> of rejecting that proposal because he was interested in making unescorted trips with the pageant contestants. Miss Sukhanova accused Kushnerev of blocking any business or travel proposals from reaching her while he was negotiating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on her behalf. At the same time, she charged, `` he constantly told me and my family that there was no interest in me among Western agencies, and that I would n't go anywhere at all if I did n't sign the contract with him.'' Miss <PERSON> Sukhanova </PERSON> said she did manage to find another outlet to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, through the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Cultural Fund, and signed a five-year agreement with an unidentified American company on July 7. She was preparing to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Aug. 13 when <PERSON> Kushnerev </PERSON> through his lawyer `` openly promised to use all his contacts all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to make sure I would never go anywhere.'' The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Cultural Fund hastily retreated and the trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is off, she said. She appealed to the newspaper for help. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for decades has frowned on beauty contests as an example of the West's exploitation of women. But reforms instituted by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have opened the way for more diversity, and that has included the establishment of several beauty contestants.

<TEXT>
 Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> on Sunday opened a parliamentary debate on his proposed Cabinet by defending his decision to drop religious hard-liners. He asked parliament deputies to fairly evaluate the technocrats he has nominated. Earlier reports said 138 of 270 deputies had petitioned <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to keep Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who leads the hard-line faction. The debate in the Majlis, or parliament, was expected to end Tuesday with a secret ballot on each of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s candidates. A majority vote is needed on each of the 22 nominees. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> made an hourlong speech Sunday in defense of ousting the hard-liners, who also included Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>. The hard-liners favor a state-controlled economy. They also believe that by confronting the West, the government feeds Islamic fervor and remains loyal to the policy of its founder, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died on June 3. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> helped establish <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, among young Shiite Moslem militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The group now is believed to be an umbrella for extremists holding most of the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. As leader of the so-called pragmatists, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is seeking to restore ties with the West to ensure a flow of foreign technology and financing badly needed to rebuild the country's economy. He also wants to boost the private sector to help <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recover from eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that ended last year. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying he looked forward to `` a fair, non-aligned assessment'' of his proposed Cabinet. `` I feel very proud in front of God that I have succeeded, despite the pressures and propaganda, to ... present to you what I think is in favor of the country, the revolution and Islam,'' he said. In addition to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 20 deputies were expected to make comments on the nominees. The proposed Cabinet, which includes several young intellectuals, has nine newcomers. Nine other nominees are already serving in the Cabinet. The rest worked for previous governments after the 1979 Islamic revolution ended 2,500 years of monarchy. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, which backs <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said in an editorial Sunday: `` It is almost certain that the 22-member Cabinet proposed by Mr. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will receive a vote of confidence from the Majlis.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> made reference to support for <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. He appealed that the deputies `` not be carried away by the poisonous propaganda of the enemies,'' and he added, `` Mr. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> is one of my closest friends and I have known him for very many years.'' However, he said he believed his nominee for interior minister, <PERSON> Nateq </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON>, is `` best for this job.'' <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON> served as interior minister from 1981-1985. Defending the newcomers against criticism that they lack political experience, the 55-year-old president said: `` With my presence, the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> would be political enough.''

<HEAD>Wreckage of 23-Year-Old Air India Crash Found on Mountain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COURMAYEUR, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-three years ago, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jetliner bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 117 people aboard slammed into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s second highest mountain, killing everyone aboard, including a noted nuclear physicist. A search at the time found part of one wing and a piece of fuselage but not the flight recorder, and the cause of the crash remains a mystery. On Friday, a guide climbing on <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blanc </ORGANIZATION>'s Miage Glacier found more of the wreckage, prompting police to return to the mountain for another look. Italian newspapers said Sunday that the mountain guide, <PERSON> Renzino </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosson </PERSON>, found pieces of the plane's fuselage as well as clothing, shoes and a bag inscribed with the words `` Fly <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Cosson </PERSON> was searching at the time for objects that might help identify three mountain climbers whose bodies were found in the ice two weeks ago. He said the climbers may have been killed by an avalanche more than 30 years ago. `` I am convinced that next summer we will find much more material. The glacier at this point is like the mouth of a river,'' said <PERSON> Cosson </PERSON>. `` It would be useless to search now. It is necessary to wait until the black box, if it still exists, emerges from the ice,'' he said, referring to the device that records flight information. Nevertheless, police said they would climb the mountain Sunday, examine the wreckage and determine if they can recover some of the victims' remains. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 slammed into the side of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blanc </ORGANIZATION>, which straddles the French-Italian border, on the Jan. 24, 1966. The victims included physicist <PERSON> Homi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jehangir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhabab </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

 Attackers on Sunday ambushed and killed a former president of the state railroad who resigned in a corruption scandal, and authorities blamed organized crime for the assassination. Investigators said two or three gunmen killed <PERSON> Lodovico </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligato </PERSON> in the driveway of his seaside home in this provincial capital in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

He resigned from the state railroad in November during a bidding scandal in which a $ 120-million contract to supply disposable sheets for sleeping berths was allegedly steered to one company. He has denied wrongdoing, but he said in his letter of resignation that the criminal investigation was one of the reasons he was resigning.

 A Soviet envoy on a Lebanese peace mission has proposed that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> both withdraw soldiers from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and a presidential election be held, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomatic sources said Sunday. Envoy <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> has been trying to sell his proposal during talks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, a key Soviet ally, the sources said. His talks represented one of several diplomatic efforts under way Sunday to end months of fierce fighting between Christians and Syrian forces. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> gun battles between Christian army units and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces allied with Moslem militias flamed anew. Sixteen people were reported injured. The latest casualties raised the toll to at least 796 killed and 2,247 wounded since the latest round of the 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8. In another development, a radical Iranian newspaper said Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> should not visit <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because he would offend Moslems. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader said such a visit could prove helpful to Moslems and Catholics. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, on Sunday on the Soviet mission aimed at a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> truce. At the same time, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sharaa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> wound up meetings on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials. Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who number about 40,000, were sent under terms of a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. The Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> was seeking a compromise that would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to reactivate a stalemated peace effort. Under his formula, Syrian forces would pull out of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the central mountains to the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> while a presidential election in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was arranged to end a year-old political deadlock, the sources reported. Syrian troops control most of the country outside the Christian sector. `` <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> is suggesting a compromise under which the Syrian pullback would be tied to an Israeli pullout from a border enclave in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' one source said. The Israeli army has occupied a self-declared `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew most of its forces in mid-1985, three years after invading <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The diplomatic source said <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> has received `` encouraging responses'' from Christian army commander <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other involved parties, but that the Soviets will ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to agree to the plan. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has vowed to force the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was named head of an interim cabinet by outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> in September. A deadlock between Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> politicans blocked election of a successor by lawmakers. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> now is vying for power with a Syrian-backed Moslem government headed by acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. In still another peace effort, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> flew into <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, on Sunday for an afternoon of talks dealing with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and other regional issues. The Egyptian government's <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the monarch immediately began meeting with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. The Tehran-based newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying if the pope visits <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he would be supporting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The Roman Catholic leader said last week he would like to undertake a peace mission to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but no date has been set. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has said a final decision will depend on security conditions in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The French government said it sent its six warships, led by the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Foch </ORGANIZATION>, to evacuate 7,000 French citizens if the situation worsens. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the navy announced Sunday that a French helicopter crashed near the Foch during a routine flight and the two crewmen were missing. It said the cause of Saturday's crash was unknown.

 About 1,000 Vietnamese refugees angry about how food was being distributed to them hurled stones at police Sunday during a riot that left 23 people injured, authorities said. Police said they used tear gas to disperse the refugees. A police statement said the violence stemmed from a dispute over the distribution of rice to the boat people on the outlying island of Tai A Chau, but it gave no details. Authorities said about 1,000 of the refugees, some armed with metal bars, gathered on the pier and began throwing stones at police. Police fired 40 rounds of tear gas before the riot ended. No one was arrested, and there was no breakdown of who was injured. About 5,000 Vietnamese boat people are staying temporarily on the island. They are waiting to be put in detention centers. Under a policy adopted in June 1988, the boat people are granted refugee status and resettled overseas only if they can prove they fled political persecution in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Otherwise, they would be considered illegal immigrants and face repatriation. About 55,000 Vietnamese are staying in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Two-thirds are living in detention camps waiting to be screened. Last month, about 200 Vietnamese at <LOCATION> Sek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> hurled stones at police who were trying to prevent them from escaping. Earlier this month, a fight broke out among Vietnamese refugees at another detention center, injuring 17 people. Also in early August, 200 Vietnamese detainees from two rival groups threw stones at each other.

<HEAD>Radicals Call Weeklong Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sinhalese radicals called Sunday for a weeklong strike against the government, ignoring a peace appeal by major opposition groups. Posters put up in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> by the radicals said the strike was to protest alleged genocide by the government. The posters, in the Sinhalese language, asked people to stay indoors and not open shops and businesses starting Monday. Other posters, believed to have been put up by pro-government groups, said anyone who heeded the strike call would be treated as a traitor. On Saturday, five major opposition parties appealed to the government and the radicals to end their bloody war. `` Fear stalks every home and peace is a thing of the past,'' a statement issued by the parties said. `` Despair, gloom and fear pervades the entire country. The slaughter, disappearances and arrests of our citizens and the escalation of crime have become a way of life.'' The statement demanded the establishment of a provisional all-party government that would include the radicals and holding of new elections. There has been no response from the government of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who was elected in December. His <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a majority in parliamentary polls held in February. At least 5,000 people have been killed in the 2-year-old campaign by Sinhalese ultranationalists, and officials say 1,130 of the killings have taken place in the last six weeks. There has been no explanation for the spurt of violence. Human rights organizations and opposition politicians say many of the victims have been suspected radicals shot after capture by security forces. In past weeks, military officials have reported scores of unidentified bodies turning up in various parts of the island every day. Sinhalese radicals began fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government after a July 1987 peace accord with Tamil militants fighting for an independent nation in the north and east. The radicals say the agreement gave too many concessions to the minority Tamils and infringed on <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignity by inviting Indian soldiers to implement it. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the dominant military power in the region, sponsored the agreement and moved in troops because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. But it got bogged down in fighting the rebels it once supported after a major Tamil militia rejected the peace plan. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have died since Tamil militants launched their separatist war in 1983. In the latest violence, military officials said five people were killed Saturday when unidentified gunmen ambushed a convoy of Sri Lankan and Indian soldiers near the town of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The officials said they were unsure who was responsible for the attack. The victims included four Sri Lankans and an Indian soldier, said the officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and complain of discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

 Angolan guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who canceled a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war last week, softened his stance after talks Sunday with South African leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said his rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> still is committed to peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and promised he will attend an African summit to put the fractured peace process back on track in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> next month. On Thursday, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said a 2-month-old cease-fire has failed and ordered his fighters to resume their 14-year war against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government But after meeting <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said in a statement: `` We welcome the prospect of resuming talks with the -LRB- Angolan government -RRB- at the earliest possible opportunity. -LRB- We -RRB- commit ourselves again to the effort to achieve peace and national reconciliation.'' The statement did not say the guerrillas will observe the cease-fire. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government and the guerrillas repeatedly have accused each other of violating the cease-fire and reported heavy fighting recently. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said the truce and subsequent peace negotiations are failing because some African leaders misinterpreted a June 22 cease-fire agreement reached in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, present at the <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> talks and a related summit in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> last week, said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to go into temporary exile and that his troops would be integrated into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s existing one-party structure. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says he never agreed to leave, but he would consider temporary retirement inside the country if he could later contest open elections. The rebels have been at war for a share in government since Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975, leaving rival groups to fight it out for power. The Popular Movement for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, now led by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, won. `` The statement issued by President <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> ... about the content of the agreements reached -LRB- in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> -RRB- ... is misleading and destructive to the prospect of peace and democratic self-determination in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. The agreements set general guidelines for ending the Angolan war but made no mention of <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s future role. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said there were no secret accords and that <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, a strong supporter of the Angolan government, is attempting to `` redefine history.'' <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> `` has succeeded in doing no more than embarrassing his friends and risking the fragile peace,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is to meet <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and other regional issues. On Friday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> and the two agreed to mediate between the warring Angolans. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> supported <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> until a regional peace treaty in December with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which also calls for a phased withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supplies the guerrillas with about $ 15 million in annual aid.

<TEXT>
 Five years after he won election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> goes before a judge Monday for sentencing on his felony perjury conviction, and most likely will be sent to prison. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, a two-term Republican from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs, was convicted June 20 on nine counts of perjury for lying to a federal grand jury about his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing as a drug-money launderer. He will be sentenced Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, who presided over <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> faces between 10 months and five years in prison on each count _ the sentences can run concurrently _ plus fines of up to $ 250,000 on each. The case falls under federal mandatory sentencing guidelines which, for his crime, do not include probation. Federal probation officials, the prosecution and <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys have filed confidential recommendations with the judge, outlining the sentence they believe is proper for <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> under the guidelines. Federal probation officials and prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of 37 to 46 months, according to published reports. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys reportedly are suggesting that the sentencing guidelines call for 10 to 16 months, and they are seeking a lighter sentence than that. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> last week declined to discuss the case, saying he preferred to wait until after sentencing to make his comments. In calling for the stiffer sentence, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bever </PERSON> said in a sentencing memorandum that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s suffering is of his own doing. `` While it is true that as a young, multimillionaire congressman with a seemingly bright political future the defendant's descent must have been quite painful for him and his family, it is a pain created by his own hand,'' the prosecutors wrote. `` As the defendant emphasizes his status as a former public official, one is remembered of the edict, ` To those whom much is given, much is expected.' Unlike so many others who have come before this court for sentencing with limited economic opportunity, limited intellectual ability and inadequate educational background, the defendant's horizon was unlimited, bound only by the strength of his character and moral judgment _ or lack thereof,'' the memo said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys used a similar argument in seeking a lighter sentence, saying he should be spared a long prison term because he lost his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, faces permanent expulsion from the state bar and has suffered enough to `` last a lifetime.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was found guilty of lying to a federal grand jury investigating a money-laundering sting operation. Evidence in his trial showed that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> repeatedly talked with the undercover agent and a political associate while he was seeking $ 850,000 to finish his luxurious Stone Mountain home, even after a time when he told the grand jury he had `` walked away'' from the proposed deal. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> ultimately accepted and endorsed a $ 150,000 check before backing out of the deal. The jury found <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> guilty of telling 18 deliberate, willful lies in his grand jury testimony. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was largely unknown politically before he won the 4th Congressional District seat in 1984, upsetting veteran Democrat <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitas </PERSON>. He was re-elected in 1986, but lost the seat in 1988 to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> while under the cloud of his perjury indictment. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> sought a speedy trial before the 1988 election in hopes of getting an acquittal and preserving his career, but the trial was aborted after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> campaign mailings, maintaining his innocence, reached members of the jury.

 One lucky gambler matched six numbers in the $ 42 million <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lotto </ORGANIZATION> drawing and became the largest single jackpot winner in the state's history, officials said Sunday. The winning ticket was purchased somewhere in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> metropolitan area, which includes the city and surrounding counties. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittkowski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> printer who was a 1984 Lotto winner, held the previous state record of $ 40 million. The state's biggest jackpot ever was $ 69.9 million for the April 15 drawing this year. That prize was divided four ways. Nationally, the biggest single lottery winner was <PERSON> Sheelah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who won $ 55.16 million in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery on Sept. 3, 1988. Other jackpots have been larger, but they were split by more than one ticket-buyer. The winning numbers drawn Saturday night were 6, 9, 33, 40, 51, 54. In addition to the one person who matched all six, 607 people matched five of the six numbers for $ 2,164.50 and 35,677 people matched four numbers for $ 73.50, said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>. The winner will receive an annual payment of about $ 2.1 million for the next 20 years, with the exact amount to be determined Monday, she said. Since July 29, when the jackpot was $ 6 million, no one has matched all six numbers, rolling over the prize money each time to the next week. Previous Lotto winners have found innovative ways of safeguarding their tickets until they can hand them in. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON>, who won $ 2 million in 1984, said he read his numbers a dozen times before he started jumping up and down and crying. `` That's when you suddenly realize you are holding the equivalent of a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in cash,'' he said. `` And it's strictly up to you to protect it for the next 24 to 36 hours.'' He put it in a strongbox in his bedroom and invited friends over to have `` strength in numbers.'' Lottery Director <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said her favorite story is the woman who stuck the ticket in her bra, `` in a plastic bag so she would n't sweat on it.''

The youths, all aged 16 or 17, were shot shortly after taking part in a rally to protest Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that exclude the 28 million black majority, the witnesses said.

 Holocaust survivors opened a public hearing Sunday to challenge experts' findings that Nazi criminal Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> drowned in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1979. The three-day hearing before a 10-member tribunal at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial focuses on claims <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> has been spotted recently in places ranging from an island off the Portuguese coast to a dental clinic in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The proceedings also follow Jewish protests over a Roman Catholic convent located at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> worked and where 2.5 million of the 6 million Jewish victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> died. <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>, known as the `` Angel of Death,'' has been accused of sending 400,000 people to die in gas chambers and of conducting cruel medical experiments on twins at the camp. This week, German prosecutors announced they are investigating new evidence suggesting similar experiments were carried out on retarded children. <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> was declared dead in June 1985 by an international team of forensic experts who concluded `` within a reasonable scientific certainty'' that a skeleton exhumed from a cemetery in <LOCATION> Embu </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, was that of <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> never accepted the findings. Relatives said <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> drowned near <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1979, but announced the death only in 1985 during an international campaign to bring him to trial. `` There are claims that <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> is still alive,'' said <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> judge heading the tribunal. `` There is a feeling, especially among <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> survivors and <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>'s victims, that not enough is being done to bring him to trial.'' Among those to testify is <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actress <PERSON> Susanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Severeid </PERSON>, who told reporters she saw a person who fit <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>'s description on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in April 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Severeid </PERSON> said she traveled to the island with her husband, a former Dutch resistance fighter, after the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was told <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> might be there. She was to testify at the hearing Tuesday. `` I think the body in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was a hoax,'' added Ms. <PERSON> Severeid </PERSON>, who starred in the television series `` The Paper Chase.'' `` I saw a man who fits his profile.'' Four Holocaust survivors also said a Brazilian dentist, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, says she treated <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> about two months after relatives announced his death. She reportedly said the man she believed was <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON> called himself <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Before the hearing, some <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> survivors held an emotional burial ceremony for ashes of victims they brought back from a visit to the camp last week.

 Thousands of people rallied Sunday to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of a guerrilla movement's armed struggle against South African rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` It has been a bitter war with thousands of young lives lost,'' <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> <PERSON> Angula </PERSON>, chief education officer of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, told several thousand people outside <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the capital. `` But at the end we can see the light of freedom emerging.'' Guerrillas of the independence movement launched their first attack against the South African-led security forces on Aug. 26, 1966, in the northern town of <LOCATION> Omgulumbashe </LOCATION>. The movement is now favored to become <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s first independent government. The movement held a rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Omgulumbashe </LOCATION> and another Sunday in <LOCATION> Katatura </LOCATION>, the black township outside <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. More than 20,000 people, mostly guerrillas, were killed in the bush war. The black nationalist fighters never were able to maintain bases in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and suffered about 10 casualties for every one inflicted upon the security forces. `` When we started the armed struggle, all the odds were against us,'' said <PERSON> Angula </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1915, agreed in December to relinquish control of the territory under a regional peace accord signed with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies. The accord calls for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to conduct a phased withdrawal of its 50,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been implementing a yearlong independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision. Elections are planned for November and independence is expected early next year. The guerrilla movement is favored to win the elections.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in the republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> on Sunday to demand adoption of Moldavian as the official language, organizers said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, activists responded to a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> attack on their drive for independence. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> criticized the nationalist movements as leading the region into an `` abyss.'' National deputies from <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, in a telegram to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> statement had spread `` disinformation to the population of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the world, causing obstacles for perestroika and the republic.'' `` We expected this,'' said <PERSON> Raimona </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakalouskis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, the Lithuanian movement. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Raiyulanu </PERSON> of the Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said 250,000 to 300,000 people jammed Victory Square in the Moldavian town of <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, holding flags and banners boosting ethnic demands. The Soviet evening news showed a crowd overflowing in the square, which was a sea of red, yellow and blue Moldavian flags. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mircha </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snegur </PERSON> addressed the crowd and appealed for calm discussion of a law making Moldavian the official language, which will be considered by the republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, on Tuesday. He said the proposal `` does not infringe on the rights of other nationalities living on Moldavian territory,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. About 2,000 members of a group called Unity, which is comprised mostly of Russians, Ukrainians and other minorities in the republic, held a rally nearby, <PERSON> Raiyulanu </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>. They passed a resolution calling the proposed law a violation of their rights, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said a third rally was held, this by thousands of <LOCATION> Gagauzi </LOCATION>, a Christian Turkish minority group. The Gagauzi, meeting in <LOCATION> Komrat </LOCATION>, also were protesting that the language law infringes on their right and the rights of other minority groups, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The rallies came amid a wave of strikes at more than 100 factories and offices in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> - and Ukrainian-dominated cities protesting the proposed language law Strikers have demanded that the Moldavian government allow more time for discussion of the law. Its final draft version was published in the official press on Aug. 20. The law would make Moldavian, a dialect of the language spoken in neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the official language. It would also restore the Latin alphabet that the Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> replaced with Cyrillic when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> forcibly took the land from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> see the adoption of the language law as vital to protecting Moldavian culture. They are one of many Soviet ethnic groups who have been agitating for more autonomy from the Kremlin. The Moldavian activists view the language law as a first step in a program modeled on the Baltic republics' more radical program of political and economic autonomy. More than 1 million residents in those three northwestern republics linked hands last week in a giant chain to protest a Soviet-Nazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of the three states. One Baltic republic, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, has declared partial sovereignty from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Saturday's official message from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body accused `` separatist elements'' of whipping up `` nationalist hysteria'' and appealed for an end to their push for secession In its own response, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organization in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> acalled for restraint among Latvians. `` Let's be united and calm, and not give in to the provocation,'' it said. Sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would hold a special meeting on Wednesday to discuss the declaration. On Sunday, the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the need for a Moldavian language law was obvious. However, it said the debate over the law had raised other, more extreme demands that worried the non-Moldavian speaking minority and prompted its protests. `` All the more often at rallies of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, you hear slogans like ` <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> for Moldavians!''' the newspaper said. It said some people in the Moldavian republic were even talking of seceding from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Police opened fire on Buddhists protesting for greater autonomy in northeastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Sunday and at least three demonstrators were killed, authorities said. Hundreds of Buddhists in the mountain town of <LOCATION> Leh </LOCATION>, 150 miles west of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, hurled stones at police who charged the crowd and fired tear gas to disperse protesters, local government spokesman M.S. <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> said. `` When this proved ineffective the police opened fire, killing a young man,'' <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. A government official in Leh said on condition of anonymity that two more people died later of gunshot wounds. <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> said 15 people were injured before police started shooting. He did not say whether others were wounded by gunfire. Troops in nearby garrisons were placed on alert and a curfew was imposed soon after the incident, he said. Buddhists make up 85 percent of the 70,000 people in the <LOCATION> Ladakh </LOCATION> region, which comprises the Leh and <LOCATION> Kargil </LOCATION> districts near <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> They allege discrimination by the Moslem-dominated local government. Moslems are 10 percent of the population and the remaining 5 percent are Sikhs and Hindus. For the past 15 years, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhists </ORGANIZATION> have fought for greater autonomy in the region, but their protests were non-violent until three months ago. Since then, there have been frequent clashes between the two communities. Sunday's deaths, however, were the first in the regional struggle. Earlier this month, the government advised tourists to avoid Leh, a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> religious and cultural center, after militants threw boulders at a tourist motor convoy near the town on Aug. 8. At least 30 Western tourists were injured.

 Police wielded clubs and fired tear gas Sunday to arrest an American and a Canadian, both Taiwanese-born dissidents advocating <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The two were then deported. Police said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi-shih </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> entered the country illegally. Police refused to say which flight they left on. About 300 policemen surrounded the two men as they were driving to speak at a seminar organized by a private law foundation in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. Club-wielding policemen used tear gas to disperse their supporters, pulled <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> out of their car, and took the two directly to the airport. About 10 supporters of <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> clashed briefly with police. No injuries were reported. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has barred <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> from returning to their native land, saying they advocate that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> no longer should claim to be part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Promoting an independent <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is considered seditious by the Nationalist government, which fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist forces on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> mainland. It still claims to be <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legitimate government. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government considers <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> a renegade province. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> managed to return to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> earlier this month to attend an annual convention for Taiwanese living abroad. Police said they used false names to obtain entry visas, and the officials ordered the two to leave before Friday or face expulsion. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said they would not leave voluntarily and wanted to fight <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s `` blacklist policy'' by staying.

 The birthplace of Irish playwright <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> is up for sale, and his admirers are trying to raise money to turn the yellow brick rowhouse into a museum. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birthplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday they have had talks with financial backers, whom they would not identify, about purchasing the eight-room house where <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was born in 1856. Owners Aida and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Giblin </PERSON> want $ 222,750 when the house at 33 <LOCATION> Synge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> is auctioned next month. But that is twice what the trust thinks it is worth. `` They're looking for quite an unrealistic figure,'' said trust chairman <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Lever </PERSON>. `` It's in a very bad state of repair.'' Ms. Lever said the trust will make an offer for the house, but `` if that is not acceptable then we've had it, that's it, out.'' Similar properties on the street named after another Irish dramatist, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Millington </PERSON> <PERSON> Synge </PERSON>, are selling for $ 81,000 to $ 108,000, she said. `` With its links to <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, the house has got to be worth double the value of other houses in the street,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giblin </PERSON> said. `` It's a disgrace that no state agency would come up with the money The house should have been declared a national monument years ago.'' Ms. Lever also criticized the lack of state funding for the house <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> lived in until he was 10 years old. The playwright, who died in 1950 at age 94, left the National Gallery of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> one-third of the royalties from his published work, she noted. The unexpected bequest was swelled by the success of the 1964 film `` My Fair Lady,'' based on <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Pygmalion.'' Other famous <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> plays include `` Man and <PERSON> Superman </PERSON>,'' `` Major Barbara'' and `` <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc.'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1876 where he found fame and fortune as an art, music and drama critic, playwright, commentator and social reformer.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed off his old first baseman's style Sunday, getting one hit in two at-bats and collecting four putouts in a softball game organized by journalists and local businessmen. A captain and first baseman on <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s baseball team four decades ago, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to live down his collegiate reputation as a good-field, no-hit player in the two innings he played Sunday on the side of a rump team of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers against a pickup squad of reporters, photographers and local residents. `` Those who said ` good field, no hit,' I think it's a vicious assault, not only on my baseball ability, but on my character,'' he quipped. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined the game in the second inning with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> team behind 7-0. He flied out to short center in his first at-bat but hit a ground double down the first base line his second time up. The White House team rallied behind his play, scoring six runs to narrow the score to 7-6. But after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left to go fishing, the opposing journalists and businessmen recovered and won the game 9-6. Softball was one of four sports activities the vacationing president devoted his attention to Sunday at his seaside home on <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. Wedged between them were two church services that he attended with his visiting houseguests, evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and his wife. Originally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was going to have what he called a `` quintathelon'' day of jogging, tennis, softball, golf and boating. He canceled the golf, saying, `` I have a rendezvous with bluefish,'' although he has yet to catch one despite attempts daily since his arrival Aug. 16. But he squeezed in a game of horseshoes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> at the tiny <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and noted that the minister recently returned from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where he preached to 90,000 people in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, like himself on his recent trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, has seen the `` fascinating change taking place'' as those countries open their political and economic systems. At the first service, where the visit of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Grahams </PERSON> was not expected, about 40 people were in attendance in the tiny wooden church. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> spoke briefly after commenting that `` One of the wonderful things about having the president go to church is you get the press to go to church.'' At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION>, close to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home, a packed congregation heard <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preach a on the prodigal son, belief in God and other Christian themes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a jovial mood, then invited the small group of reporters and photographers who travel in his motorcades to his house to watch his tennis match. Using a nickname he has given himself on the golf course and in the horseshoe pit, he said he wanted to show reporters `` what Mr. Smooth is like on the courts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his partner, son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, teamed against local friends <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Heminway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> for a vigorous game of doubles. The president's game, with a strong forehand and quick net play, was peppered with a steady patter of comments such as, `` Great return,'' `` Get in, get in'' to the ball, `` Sorry, partner,'' and `` All my fault.''

 Two gunmen killed an Iranian and seriously wounded another in an attack that the Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> blamed Sunday on Iranian government agents. A police statement said <PERSON> Bahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Javadi </PERSON>, an Iranian with a Swedish passport, died in the hospital a few hours after he was shot in the head Saturday night in the southern Cypriot coastal resort of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Javadi </PERSON>, 33, was killed as he walked back to his hotel with his mother and sister and four other Iranians, the statement said.

 Voyager 2's close-up photos of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles high, scientists said Sunday `` I believe they are active,'' or erupted at least within the past 100 years, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON>, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` There's 10 or 20 or 30 _ lots.'' `` This is a crazy idea ... but it's the best we have at the current time'' to explain the pockmarked terrain, he added. While more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active, `` the whole process makes physical sense,'' said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, leader of the Voyager 2 imaging team. `` That is a perfectly sensible explanation.'' If <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> are right, <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> is only the third object in the solar system known to have active volcanism. Earth and <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io are the others. <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> compared the new type of ice volcanoes with sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io. But he said the volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> are produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means `` it's got to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.'' Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to 50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> estimated the eruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps faster, sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward. `` The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist. The deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the blast, he added. Voyager 2 made its closest approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> on Thursday night when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloud tops. Early Friday morning, the spacecraft zoomed about 24,000 miles past <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, taking the photos that have revealed at least three kinds of icy volcanism on the moon. Voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from the floors of long valleys, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube slit with a razor blade. On Friday, scientists announced that <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> had discovered a different type of ice volcanoes, which appeared inactive and possibly extinct. They are huge flat craters, called calderas, similar to the one in which Yellowstone National Park rests. Some calderas, such as the crater atop <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> volcano, fill with lava lakes. <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s calderas, measuring up to hundreds of miles wide, fill with flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. New evidence released Sunday shows <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s ice-lava lakes `` can come up and overflow. You see that happen in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> all the time'' when molten rock lava overflows crater walls, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. So eruptions from <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s calderas once produced `` a sea of ice-like lava in repeated eruptions,'' resulting in `` massive, oceanic-scale flooding,'' <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> said during a Sunday news conference. He said at least four such calderas have been spotted on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice volcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the past century because they are located on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s huge south polar ice cap. A year on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> lasts about 165 Earth years. So if the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added. So far, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> has discovered six moons orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, in addition to <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were discovered from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It also has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that are broad bands of dust. The latest ring photo released by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Sunday shows one of those bands is even broader than thought, forming a beautiful, circular sheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s rings and extends inward toward the planet. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s latest results from Voyager's close encounters with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> found that: _ Winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s _ A day on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or take four minutes _ <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, are much hotter than the planet's middle latitudes _ The planet's magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degrees away from from the poles around which the planet rotates, a much greater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially estimated That means <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic north pole is closer to its equator than to its rotational north pole. It also means <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> is much more similar to Uranus, which has a magnetic field tilt of 58 degrees. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted 12 degrees from its true, or rotational poles. By 9 a.m. PDT Monday, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will be 2.76 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 3.19 million miles behind <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding away from the planet at 37,621 mph. The probe on Sunday was looking for lightning and auroras on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. It also sent back its best picture of heart-shaped moon 1989N1, which has usurped Nereid as <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s second-largest moon.

<HEAD>Crack Creeps Into Chicago, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crack cocaine, a common problem on the East and West coasts, is beginning to show up more and more in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area where until now it has been a rarity, police say. Authorities do n't know for sure why crack _ a smokable form of cocaine also known as rock cocaine _ had been so scarce here, but one theory is that local drug kingpins kept it out of the area because they feared it would cut into their profitable trafficking in powder cocaine and heroin. Crack is becoming a law enforcement problem in some of the poorer southern suburbs, and police fear poor city neighborhoods could be the next stop for dealers. Crack dealers have invaded other urban centers by establishing footholds first in outlying communities, police say. `` It's virgin soil,'' said <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. `` Dealers figure they can come here and start their own thing.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> street gangs have introduced crack, which has been associated with violence in dozens of cities, into <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and other cities, and police are checking reports that those gangs also may be involved in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s suburbs. A single dose of crack provides a much more intense high than snorting powder cocaine and costs less, making it popular in poorer communities and among the young. For years, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police have focused their drug activities on powder cocaine and heroin abuse. While other cities reeled under soaring homicide rates due to crack, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s homicide rate dropped to its lowest level in 20 years in 1988. Officials say the full extent of crack abuse in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has not been determined. In a four-month period ending in June, police raided 20 crack houses, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. In suburban <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 539 drug arrests were made last year and police say 95 percent of the narcotics trade there involves crack.

<TEXT>
 The final session of an international conference to negotiate peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> opens Monday, but lack of progress is to keep some key foreign ministers away. Protagonists at the monthlong conference of 19 nations remained apart on all major issues, delegates said Sunday, with the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> _ whose bloody 1975-1978 rule cost at least one million lives _ at the center of debate. Surprise concessions in the final three days were considered unlikely. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a crucial player, would attend the closing ministerial session only `` if the four committees of the conference can succeed in producing agreements.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sponsors the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of the three resistance movements fighting <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-backed government. It remained unclear Sunday whether Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would attend. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would not come because a comprehensive settlement was not in sight. It was uncertain whether resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> would head his delegation. In a surprise move, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> announced he was resigning as president of his movement, one of three parties within the resistance, party sources said Sunday. But he remained head of the resistance and was considering changing his mind, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Dissension between moderates pressing for a negotiated settlement and others opting to continue the guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> prompted <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s move, the sources said. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> named his wife, <PERSON> Monique </PERSON>, and Gen. <PERSON> Nhiek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tioulong </PERSON> to replace him as co-presidents of the movement and designated his son, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> as secretary-general. The conference has sought an overall peace settlement to end two decades of violence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s coalition and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> remain deadlocked on a formula for sharing power before general elections. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> be given a role in a transitional government to rule after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops by late September. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> must be `` eliminated'' politically and militarily. There was speculation the conference could lead to further negotiations, even another conference, at a later date, and no one was prepared to predict failure. `` We hope by the end of the year there will possibly be something,'' said <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sereywath </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s delegation He said he could not predict the outcome of the conference and was hoping for `` a surprise.''

 The justice minister resigned because of death threats from drug traffickers, local reports said Sunday, and one man was killed in the bombing of 10 banks in the cocaine-trafficking center of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. News reports also said an appeals court has revoked an arrest order accusing a top drug lord of ordering two assassinations. Local news media reports said Sunday that <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> was stepping down as justice minister because of threats against her and her family since the government launched an unprecendented crackdown on drug trafficking Aug. 18. Several radio and television stations carried the reports, which also said Cabinet changes were expected, without identifying a source. A communique issued late Sunday by the presidency said <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> `` denied reports related to the resignation of the justice minister.'' A spokesman at the presidency said he could not amplify on the wording of the communique, which appears to but does not directly deny the reports. It also quoted <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> as saying, `` I have n't thought about, nor is there motive for, a crisis within the Cabinet. It's something I have n't considered, not for now or for the future.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, 32, has been justice minister for a month and a half. A predecessor, <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, was assassinated by the cocaine cartels in 1984. According to the private national radio network <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, she told President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> she wanted to resign before leaving the country Friday for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The network did not identify the source of its information. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that if Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> applied for political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> she would be welcome. `` Of course she would be welcome as other refugees from terrorism and the kind of violence that affects <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have always been,'' he said on the CBS news program `` Face the Nation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He refused to say whether she had resigned. Efforts to reach her Sunday through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and Colombian diplomats in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were unsuccessful. The bomb blasts occurred between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. at seven branches of the national <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafetero </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the state and coffee exporters, a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview. He said the bombs did $ 100,000 in damage but caused no injuries. Later in the day, police said bombs went off at <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> branches of the private <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estado </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>, where a young man was killed. Police said they suspected the victim had placed the bomnb. Police said they were uncertain whether the bombings were carried out by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has attacked the bank's offices in the past. Last week, the traffickers declared war on the government after it began a crackdown in response to the assassinations of a magistrate, a police colonel and a leading presidential candidate during a 48-hour period ending Aug. 18. `` We do n't have any group in particular that has taken responsibility for the explosions,'' the spokesman said. Police may learn more after interrogating the two suspects, he said. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, 215 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, is the base for the world's biggest cocaine trafficking cartel that is believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The traffickers threatened to target the government, judges, journalists and industrialists because of the government's offensive. The crackdown by the military has confiscated hundreds of luxurious homes, office buildings and shops believed to belong to traffickers in addition to aircraft, cars and trucks, yachts and other goods. Authorities said the raids will continue, but so far the cartel bosses have eluded security forces. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> holds a key seat on a special national council that must decide on the proposed extradition of alleged traffickers caught up in the new crackdown and wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that a court has struck down an arrest order for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel boss <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> that accused him of ordering the massacre of peasants at two ranches by right-wing death squads. Judge <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> _ who investigated the killings, signed the arrest order in 1988 and refused to reverse it _ was assassinated on Aug. 1. A three-judge panel upheld her decision in November. But <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said the panel reversed its ruling Aug. 15, deciding there was insufficient evidence against <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, who formed a trafficking organization in the mid-1970s and has repeatedly terrorized the judicial system with assassinations and threats, according to police. No such reversal was reported at the time, and it was not possible to confirm the report with judicial officials Sunday. According to the government, the drug cartels are financing the training of right-wing paramilitary squads that, besides providing protection for cocaine barons, are blamed for the slayings of leftist politicians, labor activists, vagabonds, prostitutes and the old and infirm.

The dispatch was monitored by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Notimex agency In another report monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said evidence presented Saturday in Abrantes' trial proved the division general abused his position, improperly used financial and material resources and was negligent in service. He was also found in illegal possession of arms, the report said. Testimony showed he manipulated and withheld information of interest to the government, the agency said. The agency did not say what information <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> allegedly withheld. It gave no details of evidence presented at the trial. Three military officers and three civilians testified Saturday, the third session of the trial, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. Six other officials are standing trial with <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> on the same charges, the agency said. The officials were <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, former vice minister of the interior, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, Lt.

Four of the 14 tried earlier were executed by firing squad and the others were given prison sentences of up to 30 years.

 Thousands of friends and admirers of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> lined up for three blocks outside a funeral home Sunday to pay their respects to the slain <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> founder. `` This is a terrible tragedy for blacks. He stood for black pride in the'60s and now he stands for the decimation of blacks by crack,'' <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 44, who was among the people, most of them blacks, who waited quietly to attend the daylong wake. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, operator of the <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitted </PERSON> funeral home in a rundown section of east <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, estimated that 6,000 people filed past <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s open casket. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, 47, was shot to death Tuesday in what police said was a dispute over crack cocaine in the drug-ridden west <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years ago. He went on to found the Panthers with <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>. Thousands, including fellow radicals from the 1960s and'70s, were expected to attend <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s funeral Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The body was moved there later Sunday. `` He made us have black pride,'' said longtime friend <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Corman </PERSON>, 38. `` He was a good man destroyed by the badness of drugs.'' However, many in line at the funeral home said they did n't believe the police account of <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s death and blamed it on authorities `` The police were always after <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> deLeong </PERSON>, 28. `` The Man got him.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> handed out leaflets saying `` the word in the streets'' was that <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s death was caused by police. Most were dressed in black and many wore three-piece suits or elegant Sunday dresses. One man held a Black Panther Party flag, with its red, black and green tricolors and a red star in the center. A few wore T-shirts supporting the African separatist movement for black Americans. A television cameraman taping interviews with mourners was attacked and injured by a group of men who had warned him earlier that they did n't want their pictures taken, police and KTVU-Channel 2 officials said. Cameraman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Faybusovic </PERSON>, his camera on his shoulder, later turned toward the men, and they came at him, apparently thinking he was taping them, said KTVU-Channel 2 Assignment Editor <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorde </PERSON>. The men, who had not been in line, kicked and punched <PERSON> Faybusovic </PERSON> repeatedly, <PERSON> Amorde </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Faybusovic </PERSON> suffered cuts and scrapes and was being X-rayed for internal injuries at hospital, said police Sgt. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vierra </PERSON>. A self-proclaimed prison gang member who police say admitted killing <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> remained held without bail awaiting arraignment Monday on a homicide charge. Investigators said <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, told them he shot <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> in self-defense after <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, who battled drug and alcohol addictions, pulled a gun on him and demanded crack. Police said they do n't believe the ex-convict's account and instead think the slaying was an attempt by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION>, a drug-running, prison-based gang that <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> allegedly opposed. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s family has declined to comment since the police announcement Friday of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s arrest 14 hours after the slaying. The Black Guerrilla Family was founded in the prisons in the 1960s by inmate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>, who died in an escape attempt at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison in 1971. In the final hours of his life, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> went to a `` crack house,'' where he caused a commotion in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the drug, according to police. After being told to leave the house, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> ran into <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> a short distance away, police said. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was shot three times in the head. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who was on parole for a robbery conviction, was arrested Tuesday for investigations of weapons violations about a block from where the shooting occurred. He admitted to the killing on Friday, police said.

 It covers a space roughly the size of a football field and boasts 10 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms. But locals say <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> also carries a curse that has brought ruin to its previous owners and could be a bad omen for the home's current mistress, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> The opulent, 28-room Jacobean mansion on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> has been in the national limelight in recent weeks because of the federal tax evasion case against Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. She and her billionaire husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, were accused of billing $ 3 million in expenses at the house to their real estate empire and hotel chain. A federal jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began deliberating the fate of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and two former aides this weekend. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was severed from the indictment because of mental incompetence. The prosecutor, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, says the money was spent in a bid to turn the home into a modern Taj Mahal. `` It's probably one of the most important houses in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Majorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, president and co-owner of Preferred Properties in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>. `` This house has some history, if the walls could talk,'' said <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, who has twice handled its sale. Two previous owners lost the estate to financial setbacks, another was indicted for forgery and a <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> automotive heiress suffered marital problems with a husband who killed a busboy in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and later killed himself. The three-story brick mansion sits on 26 acres of rolling hills in the northern end of this posh <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb. Stone walls, iron fences and a sophisticated electronic system keep the curious at bay. But a glimpse is possible through the main gate and up a 1,000-foot driveway painted brick red for <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>'s birthday in 1986. The curious can also get a feel for the house by watching for a late night rerun of the 1968 film `` A Lovely Way To Die.'' The movie, starring <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, was filmed at the estate, and in keeping with the alleged curse at <LOCATION> Dunnellen </LOCATION>, it was a flop. The <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s hometown newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, recently obtained a rare look inside the house. Its reporter described in detail the ornate dining room, with its chandelier, tapestry, paintings and floor-to-ceiling wainscotting; the limestone-walled reception hall; the grand staircase; the second-floor workout room where <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> exercises on a treadmill under the eye of his personal instructor; and the pictures of a smiling <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> that grace nearly every room on the first and second floors. The main house stretches about 300 feet from end to end and is more than 200 feet wide. It has more than 28,000 square feet of living space, and includes 10 bedrooms and 10 full baths. Separate from the mansion is a 100-foot-by-25-foot guard house that provides nearly an additional 4,000 square feet of living space. The building provides five more bedrooms and three more bathrooms, according to records at the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> assessor's office. By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has 55,000 square feet of living space spread over six floors. The White House also has 132 rooms, much smaller than those in the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' mansion. <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was built in 1916 by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> for his only daughter. It had four more owners, each of whom suffered some ill fortune, before it was purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 for $ 11 million. Shortly after purchasing the home, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> constructed a 4,453-square foot addition that runs more than 88 feet to enclose the swimming pool. Constructed of limestone and marble, and topped by a marble dance floor, the addition cost about $ 2 million. It also is one expense the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s allegedly billed to their business. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said the house also features a `` dramatic'' stairway in the main entry, a `` handsome'' library and many other `` gorgeous'' rooms. Other renovations made by the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> include a $ 130,000, remote-control outdoor-indoor stereo system, which is named in the 47-count federal indictment. There's also a wine cellar that can hold up to 5,000 bottles and maintain them at 54 degrees, according to literature on the house. The kitchen features a huge walk-in bank vault that is 8 feet wide, 8 feet long and 10 feet high. Inside the vault are silver trays, goblets, candelabra ahd champagne buckets. The mansion is maintained by a full-time staff of 15, including chambermaids, three gardeners, a chef, a butler and a 24-hour security crew, the <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> reported. The previous owners who suffered the `` curse'' of <LOCATION> Dunnellen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> are: _ <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, president of a steel fabricating company who bought the house in 1950, but lost it to a commercial financing firm in 1963 _ <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> automobile family, bought the house in 1967 A year later, her husband, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> policeman, shot and killed a busboy who was apparently trying to climb into the bedroom window of their <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> home. The slaying was ruled justifiable homicide. She sold the home in 1968; 10 years later her husband died of a self-inflicted gunshot. _ Investor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> bought the home in 1968 He was indicted on larceny and foregery charges in 1971, but died in 1974 before his case was settled. _ <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikkoo </PERSON>, who owned the world's largest oil tanker, was the next owner He lost his fortune during the Arab oil embargo.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Sunday deported a prominent <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activist and four other Palestinians it accused of leading the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The deportations raised to 60 the number of Palestinians expelled from the occupied territories during the 20-month uprising against Israeli rule. Four Palestinians were deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A fifth, physicist <PERSON> Taysir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>, whose cause has been championed by international human rights groups, was expelled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after he appealed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, saying he could face death in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The deportations came as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bombed a pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> stronghold in <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing one guerrilla and wounding five others, police reported. It was the ninth Israeli air raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>'s wife brought their three young children to <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to see their father off. But she was removed by police after she became the center of a scuffle involving pro-Palestinian demonstrators and angry Israelis. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> did not speak to reporters when he arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. There has been speculation he was headed for <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But late Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources said he could be planning to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> has held meetings with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists. He advocates peaceful creation of a Palestinian state alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Sunday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would continue to deport Palestinians despite complaints by foreign governments and human rights groups that the action violates international law. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers deportation an effective deterrent against the uprising. The French <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> was welcome indefinitely in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and referred to his expulsion as `` a measure contrary to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention protecting civilians in time of war.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has condemned such expulsions as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. None of the five Palestinians expelled Sunday faced trial or formal charges. Appeals by four of the men were rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, and the fifth was turned down a month earlier. The court never has overturned an army deportation order. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>, 43, a physics professor at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> named a `` prisoner of conscience'' by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, was accused of being a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The army also said he was `` involved in planning the uprising and a member of the uprising's unified command.'' The announcement of the four other deportations said the men `` participated in leading and directing the uprising'' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. One deportee, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Matur </PERSON>, was accused by the army of being a leader of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction. The others were said to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group. On arrival in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police reported the four asked to be taken to bases of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in western Bekaa valley. Sunday's air raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was believed to be in retaliation for the Aug. 9 suicide car bomb attack carried out by the Iranian-supported <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Five Israeli soldiers and an allied Lebanese militiaman were injured in the car bombing, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have vowed to avenge the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, has said it carried out the bombing to avenge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Israeli commandos seized <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in a southern Lebanese village on July 28.

 Author <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, the pioneer of the biographical novel who wrote the popular epics `` Lust for Life,'' `` The Agony and the Ecstasy'' and `` Love is Eternal,'' has died at age 86. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> died of heart failure Saturday at 11:20 p.m. at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Correia </PERSON> said Sunday. He was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> on July 24 after complaining of difficulty in swallowing. Stone produced a stream of best-selling biographical novels that his publishing company estimates have totaled more than 30 million copies. His fictionalized portraits include <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> in `` The Agony and the Ecstasy,'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> in `` Lust for Life,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> in `` Sailor on Horseback,'' <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in `` Love is Eternal,'' <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Freud </PERSON> in `` The Passions of the Mind,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> in `` The Origin,'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in `` The President's Lady,'' and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Debs </PERSON> in `` Adversary in the House.'' Five books were made into movies. `` The Agony and the Ecstasy,'' released in 1965, starred <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> in the title role. `` Lust for Life,'' released in 1956, featured <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> as <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>. `` Irving Stone's gift was remarkable,'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said Sunday. `` He had a prodigious talent. We'll miss him, but I'm glad we still have his books.'' Stone also produced `` <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> for the Defense,'' a biography of the famed lawyer. In a 1985 interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> explained his fascination with biography: `` In the biographical novel there's only one person involved. I, the author, spend two to five years becoming the main character. I do that so by the time you get to the bottom of page two or three, you forget your name, where you live, your profession and the year it is. You become the main character of the book. You live the book.'' His wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, said her husband was working on a biographical novel up to his death and she hoped it would somehow be completed in the future. She did not disclose the subject of the book. `` The only thing he ever wanted to do was write books and that's what he did all his live and we did it together,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the couple's <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home `` That will be his immortality _ the books he left,'' she added. `` Whether you call his books biographical novels or novelistic biographies, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> set out to do something completely distinctive and he succeeded,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, book editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a teacher as well as a writer.'' `` He brought history to millions of people who otherwise might be not be interested in it,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, cultural correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Born in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on July 14, 1903, Stone attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and taught economics there. He seemed destined for a teaching career until he went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1926. There he made his first acquaintance with the impressionist artists. Out of it came `` Lust for Life,'' which was published in 1934. `` ` Lust for Life' was turned down by 17 leading publishers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> recalled in a 1984 interview. `` Always with the same comment: How can you sell a book about an unknown Dutch painter to the American public in the middle of a depression? `` At the time I was engaged to <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> -LRB- Factor -RRB- but I had no money to get married,'' he continued. `` She said, ` Let me read the book.' She suggested making cuts here and there and prepared a new typescript. <LOCATION> Longmans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION>, which had published only one novel before, accepted it.'' `` Lust for Life'' allowed Stone and Ms. Factor to marry, and she has been his editor ever since. For 55 years they had been associated with <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the houses that initially rejected `` Lust for Life.'' Stone once said he never got lonely as a writer, and added: `` I have always believed that the book is the most important tool that man has ever invented, more important that the wheel, cement or running water. `` As long as I can remember, I never wanted to do anything but write. I started with a short story at 9. I never stopped, even when I was rejected by the literary magazine at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. My manuscript came back with the note, ` Why do n't you learn how to write?','' he said. He meticulously researched each novel spending numerous months delving into archives, scouring libraries, digging in basemants, and living in garrets, studios and even asylums. `` To write the inner truth of these people, I have to get inside them. I have to go through absolutely everything they did,'' he said. `` By the end of the first page, the reader should have forgotten his name, his job, where he lives. He should have become <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>.'' Stone is survived by his wife, their son <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> and daughter <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>. A memorial service for friends and relatives will be held at <ORGANIZATION> Leo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baeck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> later this week, his wife said. There will be no funeral.

 Delegates to the first assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Sunday delayed a decision on whether to set a deadline for selling off stock in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. After some debate, the decision was deferred until later in the eight-day meeting of about 1,040 representatives, which runs through Wednesday. At issue was how rapidly the church's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pensions </ORGANIZATION> should divest from such companies to push <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its system of racial separation and domination of 28 million blacks by 5 million whites. After morning worship services in Chicago-area churches around this suburb, the delegates spent more than three hours discussing other aspects of the pension program, including medical benefits, and the South African issue. `` There is no way one can prudently divest the portfolio except gradually over a long period of time. It must be handled with care and fiduciary responsibility,'' said board President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. But the Pension Members for Justice, a group on the other side of the issue, said the church has an ethical responsibility to divest quickly. `` If we ca n't be ready to hear the voices of blacks crying for justice above the call of profit yield, then it does n't mean anything to belong to the body of Christ,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellwanger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. The assembly is the first for the 5.3 million-member denomination since the merger Jan. 1, 1988, of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. Late Saturday, the assembly called for an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and of `` all destabilizing military involvement'' by outside nations. The Rev. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moller-Gunderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said violence has increased in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The resolution backed peace efforts by the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments themselves, and urged relief and development aid for the region and lifting of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The denomination's pension board holds $ 1.6 billion in investments for about 26,000 participants, mostly clergy, 5,700 of them already retired and on pensions. <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said that since early 1988, the board had reduced investments in companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from $ 152 million to $ 84.9 million. `` We think we are one of the leading denominations in divestment,'' he said. `` But we are required by law to manage the fund solely in the interest of members with care, skill, prudence and dilegence.'' That demands financial caution, he said in an interview. He said divestment carried out without fiduciary considerations `` could mean a loss.'' However, the justice group argues that for the church, `` the notion of ` prudent investment' takes on a deeper theological meaning of faithfulness ...'' `` The board's fiduciary responsibility requires it to take into account not only economic factors, but also the gospel of Jesus Christ ... and the church's overwhelming opposition to investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the group has said. `` A church should be willing to sacrifice and take risks to end apartheid,'' said Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` It is possible it could mean a financial sacrifice. Even if it costs, it should be done for moral reasons,'' he said. Several denominations _ including the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the Church of the Brethren and the <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION> _ have decided to sell all stock in companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but are not yet totally divested. The justice group pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chris </ORGANIZATION> have have active `` no-buy'' policies for such stock and have made more progress in divesting than the Lutheran denomination. Its pension board has had a `` passive and partial divestment'' policy, the group says, and actually has increased indirect investments in companies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Forty-four of the denomination's 65 regional synods have urged the board to divest totally from firms doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Some synods set a Jan. 1, 1991, deadline for this to be accomplished.

<HEAD>Holocaust Survivors Urge Pope to Remove Nuns from Auschwitz</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors Sunday called on Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to remove a controversial Carmelite convent from a building at the site of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. A statement released by the American Gathering-Federation of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, meeting at <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s Hotel in <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> silence on the issue was reminiscent of papal inaction during World War II, when more than six million Jews died in the Holocaust. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meed </PERSON>, president of the American Gathering, said the presence of the Carmelite nuns at the site angered Jews and that they had `` set up symbols of faith holy to them but alien to most of those who perished at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>.'' The nuns have been the subject of protests by Jewish groups for about two years. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders signed an accord with Jewish leaders agreeing to remove the group by Feb. 22, 1989, but the nuns are still in the building in <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a few feet from the fence surrounding the concentration camp. The statement to the Pope read in part, `` You lived in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> during the years of the Holocaust. You know of the murders at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. ... Surely you know that the overwhelming majority of the victims were Jews, killed solely because they were sons and daughters of the Jewish people. Their memory must be honored, their identity affirmed. `` Neither a convent nor a synagogue should be on the grounds of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. The holy martyrs of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> should be left undisturbed,'' the statement said.

 Dozens of whites in a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> community where a black teen-ager was slain angrily taunted about 100 people who marched through the streets Sunday to protest the death. The protesters, led by clergy members, gathered in the <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> neighborhood where 16-year-old <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was shot dead Wednesday as he was confronted by a gang of bat-wielding whites. The group of about 30 blacks and 70 whites was escorted by 20 police on motorcycles and dozens more on foot as about 300 white residents lined the street. Many residents watched passively from windows and storefronts while others walked along the street waving posters in the air and chanting, `` Go home. Go home.'' Some residents shouted, `` Free the boys from <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>,'' a reference to five white youths who have been arrested in the slaying. Others booed the marchers and chanted `` Central Park, Central Park,'' referring to the recent rape and beating of a white jogger there, allegedly by a gang of blacks and Hispanics. Some made obscene gestures. One man was taken into custody but not immediately charged after a small firecracker was thrown at the demonstrators, said Sgt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The protesters, led by the Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, chanted, `` Whose city? Our city,'' as they walked about 10 blocks from the site of the killing through the community's streets. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is not going to become <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. This is our city and we are going to walk wherever we want. We need to see more of the good people in this community,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said at the site of <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' death. Throughout the march, police blocked streets with barricades to prevent confrontations. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three friends were attacked by a gang of neighborhood whites carrying baseball bats, two-by-fours and golf clubs when they arrived in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s mostly Italian-Jewish <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> section to answer an advertisement for a used car. Police said the gang was angered by a local white girl's dating of a black youth, and they gathered with the intention of attacking the black when he arrived for the girl's birthday party. A protest march Saturday afternoon by blacks through the mostly white neighborhood was greeted with jeers, spitting and racial slurs. Some whites held up watermelons as 300 or so blacks marched through. Residents also chanted `` Central Park, Central Park'' during that incident. The blacks answered with `` <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>,'' a reference to the December 1986 killing of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, 23. `` This is about what we expected,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Calzerano </PERSON>, the police department's chief of operations. `` The feelings are running high.'' `` If we did n't do it because of what happened yesterday then it would be just like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said before a brief memorial service at the site of the killing Sunday. Five suspects in the attack were arraigned Saturday. Four were released Sunday on $ 75,000 bail; the fifth, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18, whom authorities called the instigator, was released on $ 100,000 bail. The other suspects are <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stressler </PERSON>, 21; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON>, 24. Meanwhile, police continued looking for 18-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, who was wanted for questioning. News reports have said investigators believe he was the gunman. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stressler </PERSON> are charged with assault, aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing and possession of deadly weapons, the baseball bats. <PERSON> Patino </PERSON> was charged with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civil rights.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members at <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler-Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> joint venture, ratified a three-year contract Sunday that provides wage-and-benefit increases of more than 30 percent. The new contract, approved by 1,644 of about 2,300 production and maintenance workers at the auto assembly plant, was worked out during five months of negotiations. The vote was 1,258 in favor to 383 against, said <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The $ 650 million plant, which began making cars about a year ago, employs about 2,900 people. The company produces a two-door sporty sedan marketed as the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION> and the Mitsubishi Eclipse. `` We are gratified that the members recognized significant advances in the first contract and are confident that it builds a firm foundation for future progress,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, director of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> chapter. Under the agreement, production workers who have been on the job 18 months will have a base wage of $ 12.79 an hour, which will increase to $ 17.01 an hour at the end of the three-year contract. Maintenance workers, including skilled positions such as electricians and welders, would begin at $ 14.89 an hour and increase to $ 19.49 at the end of three years. The increases include periodic wage increases and cost-of-living adjustments. The raises are intended to bring Diamond-Star workers into line with the wages of other UAW-represented auto plants, and specifically with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plants. The contract also includes a `` me too'' provision that passes on to <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> workers any <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> increases that occur during the life of the pact. Also included is a $ 750 settlement bonus for ratification of the contract, and two lump sum payments equal to 3 percent of earnings. Job security provisions are `` among the strongest in the industry,'' according to a letter to members of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 2488 from <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, regional director. According to the contract, the company agrees not to lay off workers `` unless compelled to do so by severe economic conditions that threaten the long-term life of the company.'' If layoffs are necessary, the contract provides that workers would receive 80 percent of their pay for up to a year. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> termed that part of the contract proposal `` prededent-setting.'' The agreement also includes added health benefits, retirement at age 55 after five years of service and other improvements.

<TEXT>
 Four children ranging in age from 9 to 14 were apprehended for allegedly firing .22 caliber rifles at passing motorists on Interstate 95, wounding one person, police said Sunday. The youngsters were captured about 8:30 p.m. Saturday after a citizen reported gunfire coming from a wooded area near the highway and police sent up a helicopter to investigate, state police spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The shootings apparently began Aug. 18, when a 49-year-old <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> man was wounded in the shoulder while driving north on I-95, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. A 14-year-old La Plata youth and an 11-year-old from <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> were charged with assault with intent to maim. The 14-year-old also was charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder and one count of destruction of property, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Police believe the 14-year-old fired his weapon in the direction of the state police as they scoured the woods and as the helicopter circled above, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The 9-year-old and his 12-year-old brother, both of <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, were released into the custody of their parents without being charged. On Aug. 18, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Orchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lusby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was injured when a bullet pierced his windshield and hit his shoulder. State police also confirmed at least three other incidents of gunfire, which resulted in damage to three vehicles on I-95, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The 14-year-old was placed in the custody of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The 11-year-old was released to his parents' custody. Two .22 caliber rifles were recovered in the area where the youngsters were taken into custody, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Report Says FBI Investigates Futures Brokerage Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities are investigating whether an influential brokerage executive invested millions of dollars in a possibly illegal tax shelter, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is trying to determine whether <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest futures brokerages, improperly shielded from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> up to $ 10 million in income in 1982 and 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. Federal agents believe <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON> is one of many commodities-related businessmen who made money-losing investments overseas that enabled them to avoid paying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes on some of their earnings _ including profits from their own trades at commodity exchanges in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and other cities, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. The sources said <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON> and others may have subtracted the overseas losses from their earnings to lower the portion of their total incomes subject to federal taxes. The actions would be legal if overseas losses stemmed from legitimate investments, but investigators suspect some of the transactions involved phony paperwork to describe investments that never occurred, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> resident whose name often appears on lists of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wealthiest individuals, has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment. He denied repeated requests for an interview, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. Sources say <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON>'s attorney claims the executive did not knowingly violate any law and believed the transactions were legitimate, the newspaper reported. The inquiry into the alleged use of tax shelters does not appear to be connected to a 2 -LCB- - year federal probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which has resulted in the indictments of 46 traders <PERSON> Terree </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who is supervising one aspect of the tax shelter probe, said futures traders and other businessmen may have used losses from overseas investments to shave up to $ 500 million from their taxable incomes in the early 1980s. Investigators also are focusing on several <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessmen they suspect acted as intermediaries in arranging the overseas investments for <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON> and other brokers and traders, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Report: GM Plans To Make Antilock Brakes Standard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Antilock brakes will be standard equipment on all <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars and light trucks by 1994, according to a report to be published Monday by an automotive trade journal. Over the next three years, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also plans to offer antilock brakes as optional equipment on smaller cars, reports the weekly Automotive Electronic News. Some larger <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars already carry antilock brakes as standard equipment, while others offer them as extra-cost options. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> would not confirm the 1994 date, which the trade journal attributed to unidentified sources. `` We have said in public before that we do plan to have antilock brakes on most of our cars by the mid-1990s,'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said. Antilock brakes help prevent skidding on slippery roads or during panic stops by varying braking pressure many times a second.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s hourly workers at its <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> II assembly plant have voted 1,133-598 to open talks on a new staffing system that would allow the company to boost output of its popular stretch minivans. Voting concluded Friday, said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union Local 110 at the plant. Under the proposed staffing system, three crews would be assigned to staggered shifts of four 10-hour days each. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said tough negotiations are ahead, especially if the company resists paying overtime for Saturday work. If approved, the plan would add 1,200 workers to the plant's 3,300 employees and boost vehicle output by about 18 percent without increasing assembly line speed, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said

<HEAD>Government Announces New Screening, Closures of Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese authorities announced Sunday a new wave of closures of commercial, financial and supply companies as part of their efforts to restore central economic controls that were relaxed in recent years. An order issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet, said elimination of companies that are `` redundant, not qualified, not able to meet the public needs, in violation of state laws or disciplines, poorly managed or insolvent'' will last until March. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced the decision Sunday but said it was made Aug. 17, the first indication that the ruling party's powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met then. There was no explanation for the delay in announcing the decision. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> gave no estimate of the number of companies that would be closed. It said others would lose preferential treatment, such as tax reduction or exemption _ favors given by some locales to encourage new private or semi-private business. The government already has said it will cut sharply the number of companies authorized to conduct foreign trade on the grounds that the proliferation of trade companies in the past few years has caused market confusion. Last month, the party Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> shut down two large, state-owned conglomerates, including one linked to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Pufang </PERSON>, and ordered audits of others. In those cases, however, the main reason given was alleged corruption. The two bodies also barred children and spouses of top government and party leaders from working in commercial companies because of frequent conflicts of interest. The government said Saturday that all those affected by the order had quit their jobs. The new order was much broader and appeared directed at the millions of factories and commercial companies that have sprung up outside the state plan during a decade of economic reform. Central authorities have been trying since last fall to regain control over these companies, of which some fall under provincial or city governments and others are privately or collectively owned. These operations have far outstripped the large, central-government controlled sector in efficiency and profits, and have siphoned away scarce raw materials and funds. Many local governments so far have defied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s orders to `` rectify'' their economies, and it was not clear how the government intended to enforce the new order. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said provincial governors would share responsiblity for its implementation.
