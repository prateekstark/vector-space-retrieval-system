 When Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s son was undergoing cancer treatment, the senator was absent from the Capitol for three days every three weeks for two years. He did n't lose his job. When Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., had surgery that laid him up for months, he did n't lose his job either <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., used those examples to underscore why Democrats will be back next year pressing for a parental and medical leave bill that died Friday along with a major child care initiative `` These two items will be top priorities in the next <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Backers of the two family bills failed Friday to get the 60 votes they needed to limit debate and complete action on the measure. The vote was 50-46. The package, which also included a crackdown on child pornographers, was on the floor for the better part of two weeks amid intense political and parliamentary maneuvering. Supporters found some solace in the heightened visibility of their causes. `` It was an extraordinarily wonderful job of educating both members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON>, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., sponsor of the child care and parental leave bills, said he would re-introduce them on the first day of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January Accusing Republicans of waging `` a filibuster by silence,'' he declared, `` The stonewall prevailed. They defeated the American family. But we're not going to lose forever. We're going to win these issues.'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., sponsor of the parental leave bill in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote marked the beginning of the fight and predicted supporters would have renewed strength next year `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s got to learn that you ca n't keep playing'' with family issues, she said. `` People are going to be angry that there's been such a high level of rhetoric and so little produced.'' But the groups who fended off the parental-leave and child-care provisions this year vowed to be back in force next year as well. `` This was round one, but it was very much indicative what the proponents of -LRB- child care -RRB- and parental leave will face in the future. They're going to face a battle again and again, not only from the business community but from groups like ours,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepley </PERSON>, a lobbyist for Concerned Women for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. She said the conservative group's nearly half-million members are active in every congressional district in the nation. The three elements of the family package included: _ <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s original bill requiring employers of more than 50 people to offer workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave when they have newborn, newly adopted or sick children, or have serious medical problems themselves _ An anti-pornography initiative sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, which creates new crimes and punishments for those who possess, sell or distribute child pornography or obscene materials It was added to the parental leave bill on a unanimous vote. _ The $ 2.5 billion Act for <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, also sponsored by <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, aimed at helping low-income parents pay for child care at centers or homes It was presented as a compromise between <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and was to have included a tax credit for poor families in its final form. Republicans maintained <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had more pressing matters to deal with, such as drug and tax bills, and refused to offer amendments or strike a compromise on the family bills. `` What we've done in effect is say slow down,'' said Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` This is n't an urgent measure that needs to be passed in the waning days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Educators addressing the nation's top business leaders say both presidential candidates have failed to fulfill their promises to make education a priority of their campaigns. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to be known as `` the education president'' and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said `` no issue ... means more to me.'' However, over the past year there's been `` a strange silence,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching. `` A few little pieces have come along, revolving mainly around college loans and grants, but I have not seen a coherent program from either candidate.'' `` I am disappointed with the lack of a sense of urgency,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, president of the Children's Defense Fund, which takes a liberal approach to family issues. `` Never have we heard so much discussion. But the proof of the pudding is in the concrete proposals, the willingness to invest,'' she said. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and other education leaders spoke Friday during private sessions of the Business Council, composed of 62 chief executives of the country's biggest companies. They talked with reporters afterward. The executives were gathered for their twice-a-year meeting in this resort town in the mountains of western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the 665,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said he agreed that neither candidate had a well-developed education program, but he said he preferred <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because the Republican tilts toward providing federal assistance to private schools. `` For us that's a life and death difference. If you move away from the public schools ... that's abandoning the major institution we have in our society for improvement of education,'' he said. However, former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should more strongly emphasize using free market competition to improve education. `` The school system is terrified of -LRB- competition -RRB-. They have a government monopoly. They do n't have to compete for their kids. Why would they want to change? The problem is, of course, they're giving everyone a lousy education,'' he said Both <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said they were encouraged that business leaders recognized education's importance to the future of the country. `` They are voices that are listened to -LRB- by politicians -RRB-. They're not going to listen to a third grade teacher They are going to listen to the president of a major corporation. Even the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will answer a phone call from the people in this conference,'' <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said. Also scheduled to speak to the business executives finishing a two-day conference today were <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, a forme chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>; Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the chairmen of the congressional budget committees, and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the co-chairmen of a blue-ribbon commission studying the budget The council, formed in 1933 as an advisory panel to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, selected <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to serve as its chairman in 1989 and 1990.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Friday declared the campaign season open for general elections to be held May 7 of next year and said the ballot will not be affected by strained diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A president and two vice presidents will be elected by simple majority of votes in May, to serve five-year terms beginning June 7. Elections for the legislative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and local offices will be held June 4. The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique the campaign schedule will be respected despite <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political and economic crises. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> trying to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander and as such, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking and money laundering charges, which he denies. When President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last February, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> himself was dismissed by the Noriega-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions have helped push <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy into its worst depression since the 1930s. Under election code changes approved by the assembly in August, mayoral elections were eliminated in 68 towns and cities. Beginning in 1989, the president will appoint mayors. The changes also require public office-holders who are presidential candidates to resign three months before the election. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has given no indication whether he plans to resign as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander and run for president as standard-bearer of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Since a military coup in 1968, the presidency has been a ceremonial post dominated by the armed forces. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> ran as the government candidate and won the presidential election in 1984, the first in 16 years. He resigned under pressure in 1985 over differences with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. With the military's support, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>. The opposition has not yet said whether it will take part in the election. Legally registered opposition parties include the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. More than 1.1 million Panamanians are registered to vote in May. In the 1984 presidential elections, 917,000 voters were registered.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is broadening his campaign stump speech to heap praise on besieged <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. During the latest in a series of campaign-style trips aimed at helping <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> keep the White House in Republican hands, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on several occasions Friday put <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s name in a favorable light. This was in addition to the usual <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plaudits for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president departed from the text of a dinner speech to tell his audience that `` someone I know and respect came through for us and all Americans the other night.'' `` I have to say, I was n't surprised,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance in debate with Democratic rival <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` Sure, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> establishment was betting against him, but I can tell you, the smart money was riding on a great senator by the name of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' he added. `` I tell you, he got my vote. How about you?'' the president asked, bringing applause from the audience. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had seldom mentioned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s name in recent campaign outings, but White House officials were unwilling to talk about the apparent change in strategy. The kind words for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Friday started the moment <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left the White House in the morning en route to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, when he made mention of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator while commenting on the latest drop in unemployment figures. `` We've talked about the record 70 months of economic expansion, but these figures tell the real story that people can understand,'' he said. `` And that's what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stand for and it's what the administration has worked out for the last eight years.'' Once he arrived in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the president continued the pro-Quayle statements he had commenced Thursday in the wake of criticism of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's performance in Wednesday's vice presidential debate. Speaking to a luncheon of business executives in <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` one thing's even clearer to me after watching the debate Wednesday night: the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket will continue the policies of peace and prosperity that have _ as <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said _ made this great nation ` the envy of the world.''' Then, in his address to a $ 1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeated that refrain. The president had talked glowingly of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the days immediately following the Republican National Convention in August, tossing the senator's name prominently into a speech he made Aug. 24 in a joint appearance with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the past few weeks had not alluded to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in these stump speeches.

 The fire chief of this southeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community says he's relieved that an underground coal fire was extinguished before reaching any homes. `` We were lucky to get to it in its infancy,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said. Thought the eight-day fire threatened as many as 30 homes, none in the town of 5,000 people was damaged. <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said the blaze was extinguished Friday after firefighters poured water and a synthetic foam into holes bored into the earth. The fire, which covered a 40-by-40-foot area, was discovered Sept. 30 when children playing on a hillside poked sticks into the ground and saw that the sticks were on fire when they pulled them out. The fire, which extended downward four feet, burned refuse coal that was believed to have come from an unmapped mine abandoned in the 1920s. <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said the fire entered a coal seam and could have burned indefinitely had it not been extinguished so soon.

<TEXT>
 `` There is no index of character so sure as the voice,'' British statesman and orator <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Disraeli </PERSON> once said. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential candidates were judged by that standard alone, neither Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have a chance of winning the election, in the view of speech pathologist <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>. `` It's about time the candidates begin to work with consultants,'' she said. `` They have to realize, we do n't live in a democracy in terms of appearance.'' Politicians often are judged by how they look and sound, not by their policies, she said. Ms. Glass, 34, the author of `` Talk to Win: Six Steps to a Successful Vocal Image,'' has been analyzing the voices of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> since the early stages of their campaigns. Prior to the Republican National Convention last July, Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s high-pitched, nasal voice negated his strong physical presence and made him appear `` wimpy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, she said, spoke in a monotone and was unemotional. `` An election can be lost solely on how you sound,'' Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said. Both candidates, however, demonstrated a vastly improved speaking style during their first debate on Sept. 25, she said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not perfect ... but he's lost the wimp factor,'' Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said after the debate, noting his slower, more methodical approach, lower-pitch and stronger inflection. The changes in the vice president, for the most part, are being attributed to the coaching of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television producer who serves as the campaign's senior media advisor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> denied molding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s image. He said any changes are in the eyes of the public. `` People are starting to view him as a president and not as -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assistant,'' he said. `` I mean the man is the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. You do n't get there because three months ago you decided to do something about your voice.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a lot of potential as an orator but has not yet mastered a presidential style, Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said. `` He did n't go up as much at the end of sentences like he used to,'' she said after the Sept. 25 debate. `` He had better diction and less staccato in his voice.'' As for the diction of the vice presidential candidates, there is no comparison, said Ms. Glass. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' best asset is <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' she said. `` He blows everybody away with his beautiful projection, posture and good inflection. His security and warmth come across.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator has a take-charge persona that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can learn from, Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on the other hand, comes across unsophisticated and `` twice as wimpy'' as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ever did, the speech therapist said. `` He's a good-looking man with a high, nasal voice and that does n't reflect a lot of self-confidence.'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looks like a star and is beginning to sound more like a star,'' she said. `` If he had a star running mate, it would certainly help the ticket be more powerful.'' Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said all the candidates should use <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a role model. `` Whether you agree with his politics or not, you feel his compassion and dedication to the country,'' she said. `` He has a very calming effect.'' What makes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> so good? `` His excellent posture, his body movement, how he uses the camera,'' Ms. <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> said. `` It's his friend. When he's angry, you see it. When he's up, it's reflected in his voice.''

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, published a government notice in its Friday editions that condemned what it called the newspaper's `` defamatory'' reporting of the shootings of three labor activists. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> notice criticized a <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> editorial Thursday that accompanied the texts of two government protests of the newspaper's reporting of the Sunday shootings. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> printed the protests under government order. Friday's notice, was an `` admonition.'' Under a new emergency law approved by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the president can shut down print and broadcast media for `` the maintenance of public order,'' but <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was not ordered to close. The ministry notice said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> `` insists in its defamatory campaign of portraying the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as responsible for criminal events.'' It accused <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> of depicting the government as generating `` a climate of threats against all persons and organizations that say something against the Sandinista party.'' In its Thursday editorial titled, `` An unjust order without right and without reason,'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> said the government protests were `` two precipitous documents ... that, lamentably, once again incorrectly cite the country's laws and once again display an ignorance of the legal norms that apply to the exercise of freedom of expression in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> also said that `` it is obvious that in recent days, gangs of uniformed men with weapons only the army has have committed brutal crimes that, inevitably, show common or similar elements.''

<HEAD>Congress Expected To Act On Sludge-Dumping Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote next week on compromise legislation to ban disposal of sewage sludge in the ocean by the nation's only remaining ocean dumpers. The new agreement, struck Friday by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees, sets a Dec. 31, 1991, deadline for dumping in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> by nine authorities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The legislation imposes stiff fines aimed at making the dumping exorbitantly expensive, and pools the fines to pay for alternatives. `` The agreement is tough but fair. Clearly the end of ocean dumping is in sight,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, the prime <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor. `` This bill is a major step in cleaning up our oceans,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, D-N. The compromise reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in August and by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes on the compromise are expected Wednesday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign the bill. Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine agencies at a site about 106 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987. Experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping of sludge. The new bill requires dumpers to pay fees of $ 100 per ton of sludge beginning on Jan. 1 of next year. Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would have to pay penalties in addition to the fees.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is hammering the Republicans on a theme of economic nationalism, saying <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hung a `` do not disturb sign'' on his door while foreign competitors and investors battered and bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries. The Democratic presidential nominee was campaigning back in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today, visiting <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on a sentimental stop at the place where his parents attended college only a few years after emigrating from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The trip to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, capping a campaign week highlighted by his running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s debate with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was bringing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to a small state but one the campaign hopes to carry on Nov. 8 _ despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summer mansion on the coast at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. `` We want to carry all of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home states,'' quipped press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> in a remark lampooning the vice president's loose ties to several states. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor returned to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> late Friday after campaigning in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, assailing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's record on foreign trade and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate remark praising foreign investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies for creating jobs. But the campaign was embarrassed to learn that the <ORGANIZATION> Moog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wellston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a speech blasting the Republicans on the foreign investment issue, was actually owned by an Italian auto-making conglomerate through a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holding company. And the company was bought out 11 years ago, during a Democratic administration. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said some in the campaign knew of its ownership, but top campaign officials did not know and neither did Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., who accompanied <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the plant <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s blasts at foreign ownership set off murmers among workers at the plant, and aides acknowledged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was unaware of the ownership when he praised the company and its workers as `` survivors'' in the fight for American businesses and products `` If anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just remind them of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he's happy that foreign owners are buying up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to foreign owners, but that's not the kind of future <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and all of you want for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has spent the last eight years with a ` do not disturb' sign hanging on his office door,'' ignoring the trade issue. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enjoyed a trade surplus of $ 7 billion in 1981, when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration took over, and that by 1987 the nation suffered a trade deficit of $ 154 billion. In the debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country, rather than going elsewhere. Because by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> borrowed some of the rhetoric of former rivals <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries as he lamented the decline of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the leading manufacturer of consumer electronics such as color televisons, video cassette recorders and telephones. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are calling for a new trade policy that they say will require reciprocity, or prohibiting foreign companies from flooding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with products when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers are locked out of those countries. They also support limited restrictions on imports of some foreign products, including textiles, so long as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies respond by modernizing to become competitive. Before heading home, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Ashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and spoke to a crowd of 2,000 people jammed around the home of the late author <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. Now restored, the two-story white frame house with stained glass windows, which was <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s mother's boarding house that he recalled in the book `` Look Homeward Angel,'' served as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backdrop and he recalled traveling to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1960, fresh out of law school, just to visit the house. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited a Wolfe quotation that approximated the candidate's own often-repeated theme _ that `` the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come'' _ and declared the two debates between the Democratic and Republican tickets have changed the complexion of the race. `` I think some things happened on that stage, and some things happened around the country ... that have made this a brand new campaign,'' he said. `` We're starting to move folks. You can feel it.''

<HEAD>Water Purifier Added Chemical As it Filtered, FTC Judge Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An administrative judge has ruled that a company falsely advertised a water purifying device by failing to disclose it added a probable carcinogen to the water it filtered, a newspaper reported today. Last month's ruling by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> showed `` utter disregard for the welfare of its consumers and blatant disregard for the law'' in marketing its <ORGANIZATION> Norelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had filed an administrative complaint against the company in August 1987. The complaint said that while ads for the machine claimed the product made tap water clean or cleaner, they failed to disclose that filters formerly used in the product actually added a potentially hazardous chemical to the water. The filters, which the company recalled in 1986, added the chemical methylene chloride to the water that passed through them, the complaint said. The chemical, used as a solvent in glues, paints and other substances, has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The company sold 186,000 of the filters between 1982 and the start of the recall in 1986, the Times reported. The company said distributing the tainted filters was a management mistake, and that it would not appeal the judge's decision, which would become final after review by the five-member commission, according to the newspaper `` We have never had that kind of accident in our 50 years of business in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we feel it has reflected too negatively on our corporation,'' said <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> va n't <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Norelco </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. `` Many of the people involved with this thing are no longer with the company,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozen </PERSON>, the company's general counsel.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Medical Waste Bill, Sends It Back to House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation to combat midnight dumping of medical wastes has won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval and now goes back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for further action next week. The bill, which was passed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote Friday night, sets up a system to track infectious waste like that which fouled <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> beaches last summer. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a similar bill on Thursday, but now the two pieces of legislation must be reconciled before moving toward final congressional approval. `` Spending a day at the beach should n't have to be followed by a day at the doctor,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, a sponsor of the bill. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval came after several minor changes were made in a version that had been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, requiring it to be reconsidered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week. The legislation was prompted by the waves of used syringes, vials of AIDS-infected blood and other hospital waste that washed up on beaches along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> during the summer. The waste became a health problem, closing some beaches because of the threat of hepatitis and other diseases. The bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to set up a system to track dangerous waste from hospitals, labs and clinics to its disposal. Initially, the program would cover just 10 states: <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Later, the program could be made national in scope if other states petition to subject their medical waste to the same cradle-to-grave monitoring system for medical supplies. Included in the paper-trail tracking system would be blood, hypodermic needles, scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that has been in contact with infectious agents. They would have to be segregated from other medical waste and tracked to make sure they reached a proper disposal facility. The problem has received substantial publicity this year after fouled stretches of beach in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> were closed, ruining vacations and causing lost revenues for oceanside businesses and resorts. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said the waste problem appears to be the result of illegal dumpers who `` threaten the well-being of their fellow citizens to save a few dollars in disposal costs.'' Lawmakers criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which they said has had authority to regulate the wastes but has ignored the problem.

<HEAD>Land Battle Delays Action On Tax Benefits Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A catchall package of special tax benefits that has been two years in the making faces a new challenge because of efforts to protect the site of one of the Civil War's bloodiest battles. On a 50-25 vote Friday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> attached to the tax bill an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., that would seize 540 acres of land on which the Second Battle of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> was fought in 1862 The aim of the provision _ which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has approved _ would be to block development of a shopping mall on the land. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has said he would recommend that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto any legislation to which the amendment was attached. `` You are asking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to follow you in a <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s charge to the president's veto pen,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., told <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> But without his amendment <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said, the promontory where Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had his headquarters during the battle will be paved over. `` And I can see a big granite statue in that mall -LRB- with the inscription -RRB-: ` General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> stood on this spot,''' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. In siding with <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> turned down a substitute plan by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, which would have allowed the federal government to take 80 acres of the privately owned land and allow housing construction on adjacent areas. Debate over the Manassas amendments and several other non-tax proposals delayed final action on the bill, whose main purpose is to correct errors and clear up confusion arising from the big 1986 tax overhaul. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already has attached to the measure dozens of special tax benefits worth about $ 2.76 billion plus the assorted tax increases necessary to pay for them. The package includes a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The bill relieves farmers from the federal tax on diesel used for off-road purposes and from the `` heifer tax'' on livestock-production expenses. Other beneficiaries include free-lance artists, corporate investments in research, first-time homebuyers, contributors to college athletic funds, and workers who receive employer-financed legal or education aid. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to a final vote on the bill Tuesday night, but only after considering another two dozen amendments. Congressional leaders hope negotiators can then work out a compromise between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and the $ 7.5 billion version already approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The tax bill is one of two major measures standing in the way of adjourning the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; the other contains tools to fight drug abuse. For that reason, senators know that if they have any hope of getting a pet project approved in the closing days of the session, it will have to be tacked onto the tax bill. At nightfall Friday, more than 100 amendments were waiting to be considered, and Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was not `` This list is crazy, nuts and getting crazier all the time,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We ought to settle down and get our senses.'' Within two hours, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> announced senators had agreed to drop all but 29. `` This is the typical tax bill,'' said Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` Everybody cleans out their desks and their trash cans and says ` we'll put it on the tax bill.' We've reached the point that if somebody does n't take the bull by the horns, we'll never finish. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected amendments calling for:

 A speeding car hit a utility pole Friday night and careened into a group of five girls on a sidewalk, killing all of them, authorities said.

The accident occurred at 6:49 p.m. in <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION>, a village of 1,875 located about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` The entire community is in a state of shock,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pulaksi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Principal Guy <PERSON> David </PERSON>.

 Thousands of demonstrators nationwide marched on goverment buildings and demanded an overhaul in the communist hierarchy in a spreading wave of ethnic and economic unrest. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, trying to control the strife, promised urgent personnel changes and economic reforms later this month. The protests Friday came just one day after 30,000 people surrounded a government building in the province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, battling police and eventually forcing the resignations of the 15-member provincial Politburo. More than 10,000 people, some chanting `` You betrayed us,'' staged a similar rally in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION> on Friday in the republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, demanding the immediate ouster of the local communist party leadership. The rally in front of the Montenegrin <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building was triggered by a strike of about 1,000 construction firm workers who put down their tools earlier Friday to protest low wages and falling living standards, state-run media reports said. Several similar protests, triggered by the country's worst economic and social crisis in history, were staged Friday in eastern and southern parts of the country. Meanwhile, the ruling national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> presidium issued a statement saying the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum to meet Oct. 17 `` will make necessary personnel changes in the presidium, which should contribute to the more efficient work of the organ.'' There have been increasing calls in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> for top-level personnel changes as the unrest continues. The public protests stem from a general dissatisfaction with a crippled economy and long-simmering fueds between ethnic groups. Communist leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse tensions between the mostly Christian Slav minority and the largely Moslem ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority in the southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province _ a hotbed of unrest _ in the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, 400 high school students from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> marched Friday on the national <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, chanting that Serbs will never give up power in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an autonomous province bordering <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio reported. Serbs, who are mainly Christian, charge that persecution by <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s ethnic Albanians is forcing them to emigrate. Mostly Moslem ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's population In <LOCATION> Krusevac </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, several thousand workers demonstrated Friday to demand higher wages and the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders, the radio said. The presidium statement appealed for urgent changes in the country's political and economic system to help in resolving the current crisis, which includes growing labor unrest, a 217 percent annual inflation and a $ 21 billion foreign debt. In a recent interview, Yugoslav Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said the country `` will introduce a completly new market-oriented economic system as of 1989.'' Currently, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economy is a mixture of Western-style free market system and Soviet-style central planning. Nearly 100 people, including 14 policemen, were injured in Thursday's rioting in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, in the city of Novi Sad. Demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at police. The protest eventually caused the mass resignation of the <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership, which was considered a major victory for the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> communist boss <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, hailed by his supporters as political heir to the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, has been demanding more central control for his republic over its two provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> are the country's only two autonomous provinces. Thursday's shake-up in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> has prompted speculation that <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party leaders could also be on their way out too.

 A fire at a swimming pool company spewed a cloud of gas over this desert resort, forcing the evacuation of several hundred residents Friday evening and the closing of an airport, officials said. Thirteen people, including three firefighters, were treated by ambulance crews for breathing difficulties and burning eyes, but no serious injuries were reported, said city spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON>. The gas, apparently a brew of pool cleaning and treatment chemicals, spewed from a warehouse during a fire that broke out about 5:30 p.m., Ms. <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said. Shortly before 10 p.m., the cloud dissipated, residents were allowed to return home and the airport was reopened, Ms. <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said. There was no immediate determination of the cause of the fire at <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION>, or a complete analysis of the chemical released, she said. Chlorine, a common pool chemical, is hazardous, and other chemicals used in pools include acids. The cloud spread over a neighborhood of upper-middle-class homes and people were evacuated from an area about one-half mile square, she said. `` It's smack in the middle of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said, adding that the evacuated area included homes and a few businesses, but none of the city's hotels. Officials were n't immediately able to determine what gases were in the cloud or the danger posed by the gas, which Ms. <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> described as having a stinging, acidic taste. No estimate of the number of evacuees was immediately available, but they probably numbered in the hundreds, the spokeswoman said. Commercial flights and private jets en route to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Regional </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> were diverted to <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 50 miles to the west. Outgoing flights were canceled and the airport was evacuated, Ms. <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> is about 110 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As darkness fell, the cloud appeared to be dispersing and drifting east, toward the communities of <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Rancho Mirage.

Domestic news media have said he has cancer, but officials have declined to comment on the reports. The 87-year-old monarch remained in stable condition today, officials at the Imperial Palace said. His temperature fell to 98 degrees from 99.5 the previous night, and a new antibiotic to treat his inflamed bile duct was apparently working, they said. His normal temperature is said to be about 96, but today's reading was the lowest since last weekend Scores of festivals, events and even official state visits by foreign dignitaries have been canceled since he fell ill.

 Nearly 350,000 Chileans took to the streets in a joyous rally to celebrate President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in a referendum, but at least 40 people were injured in violent clashes with police Half a dozen people lay on the street behind <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s national palace Friday evening after police fired tear gas and water cannons at a crowd of several hundred anti-government demonstrators and then charged, nightsticks swinging. The demonstrators had come from the peaceful rally at an outdoor park, where the crowd estimated by police at 350,000 swayed and sang to popular Chilean music. About 18 foreign reporters also were injured Friday in the demonstration at the national palace and other incidents, which they described as unprovoked attacks by police. At least six were treated at clinics for head injuries. Earlier Friday, soldiers at an army barracks near the rally site fired birdshot and pellets at passengers in cars who flashed the victory sign at them, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION> reported. Fifteen people were injured, including one who underwent surgery to remove a pellet from his head, the radio said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Santiago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that nine people were treated there for gunshot wounds, and a tenth was taken to a neurological hospital for surgery. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said there was no one available to comment on the incidents. Friday's rally was organized by the opposition political groups that urged Chileans to vote `` no'' in Wednesday's referendum in which <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, lost his bid to remain president until 1997. His defeat sets the stage for presidential elections in December 1989 and the inauguration in March 1990 of the first freely elected president since <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, commander of the army, toppled <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in a bloody coup in 1973. Opposition leaders want <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to move up the date of next year's elections, and vowed Friday to press that demand even though the aging commander-in-chief firmly rejected it Thursday during a speech broadcast nationwide. `` If we -LRB- opposition groups -RRB- join together with more force, I think the situation will change,'' said moderate Socialist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a leader of the 16-group opposition coalition. `` You have to give the defeated a couple of days to recover from the shock.'' Many of the 3.8 million Chileans who voted against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> also want early elections. `` <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON>. Get Out <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>,'' chanted the crowd at the rally. Funerals for two people killed during anti-government demonstrations Thursday night were set for today. Police acknowleged they shot a 31-year-old man and said a 14-year-old boy was shot by an unidentified gunman, police said. Two others who were shot by unidentified gunmen was hospitalized in serious condition Friday, police said, adding that eight officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators Thursday. Dozens of people were arrested Thursday and Friday. Most were released after brief detentions. Among the foreign journalists injured were <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an American freelance photographer for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Liliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> photographer for the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. They and at least three others were treated at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clinica </LOCATION> for head injuries. A group of about 50 foreign journalists, mostly Latin American, walked to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> station and filed a complaint protesting `` the lamentable events against the dignity of reporters ... by national police and other security forces'' and asked for guarantees of their safety. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman for the journalists, said two reporters _ <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjuan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jordy </PERSON> <PERSON> Villaroel </PERSON> from TV-3 in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ were hospitalized Friday after they were beaten by police.

 When it comes to forecasting the weather, just give <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> a woolly worm and a corn husk. `` I think it'll get a little warmer before it gets cold again, and give us some real nice days in November,'' was her pronouncement this week on Helen Lane Day in <LOCATION> Crab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchard </LOCATION>, a town 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. The 68-year-old prognosticator, considered generally accurate for the past 29 years, predicted two heavy snowfalls for the coming winter. Mrs. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> has been making predictions since 1959, when her warnings of a harsh winter were followed by 28 storms and more than 6 feet of snow. `` Do n't Say You Were n't Warned'' was the headline in the <LOCATION> Crossville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chronicle </LOCATION>, which published her predictions that autumn. People have paid attention to her assessment of woolly worms, corn husks and the number of dense August fogs ever since. The darker the woolly worms and the thicker the husks, the more severe the winter will be, she says. This will be a generally cold, dry winter, she said Thursday. There could be more snow than the two storms, she said, but it wo n't amount to much. Mrs. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> learned her methods from her father, who in turn absorbed the lessons handed down from previous generations.

 The biggest fish story of the week to come out of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION> lost some of its teeth when a fisherman's catch turned out to be a vegetarian pacu instead of a flesh-eating piranha. The unusual fish was hooked by a <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> man Monday and rumors quickly spread that the perch-shaped creature with lots of teeth was a piranha. `` I called a state biologist because I'd never seen a piranha,'' other than in books and movies, said Chief <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> froze the fish for examination by biologist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. The report that came back Wednesday from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game said the fish was actually a pacu, a vegetable-eating creature in the same family as the piranha. A native of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the pacu probably would n't have survived the winter in the lake in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> also went back to the small lake Thursday to squelch the rumors among the lake's fishermen. State law prohibits importation or possession of piranha but it does n't apply to the pacu. `` I think somebody is just letting them loose, kind of like people who start forest fires to sit back and watch,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said.

 Two years ago, an activist group described a near catastrophe at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear plant in 1965 but the report largely went unnoticed. This week the incident was detailed by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, proving, the activists say, that they are not the `` kooks'' they've been called for years `` I'm glad that people are beginning to pay attention,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a natural resource policy and education group. `` We've been saying this kind of thing for a long time. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the plant's operator, insisted Friday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government plant _ the nation's sole producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium _ is safe. `` We believe these facilities are safe; otherwise, we would not operate these facilities. We have never had an accident that has put the community around us or our employees at risk,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, manager of public relations for <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> at the sprawling operation in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> line. Du Pont President <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolard </PERSON> sent a telegram to four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators Friday saying the company welcomed their call for a review of the plant's operations following a congressional hearing in which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disclosed 30 serious mishaps that previously were kept secret. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' story, based on a memo found in a public document room at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, said some cooling water leaked in a reactor and a foreman wanted to close valves that limit the cooling water supply. The foreman's senior supervisor prevented the valves from being closed, narrowly averting disaster, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> engineer who wrote the memo. The foundation's report two years ago quoted the same engineer and said closing the valves would have caused the reactor to destroy itself. Ms. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the Times' story was the `` most dramatic'' example she knew of the popular press catching up with news her group has reported. `` I'm not one to say I told you so,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, a nuclear specialist with the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` On the other hand, I'm glad we're able to say I told you so now instead of when one of these accidents get out of hand.'' Though activists have for the last decade pointed to problems at the plant, they've learned during the past two weeks more details about safety problems there. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit environmental research and advocacy group, said his group used the federal Freedom of Information Act to obtain 50,000 pages of information about the plant. But, he said, that information only revealed two of the 30 serious mishaps listed in a document made public by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at the congressional hearing a week ago. `` We are now wondering what else is going on there that the public has n't been told about,'' he said. `` It's a rogue operation. It's out of control.'' About 100 protesters have been arrested at the plant during the last decade, according to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>, a group based in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that organized the major protests at the plant. `` It's clear that people who had been calling us kooks 10 years ago are now saying the same thing we were'' about the safety problems, said <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bursey </PERSON>, the group's director.

 The discovery of a dead Palestinian, his hands tied with army-issue rope, triggered a new round of clashes between Arabs and soldiers and the highest one-day death toll in six months, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Israeli troops shot and killed four Palestinians and 21 others were wounded during the violence in the occupied territories. An army official confirmed one death in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> but said soldiers were not involved. He said the army was checking the other fatalities. In another development, the body of a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was found in a cave near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Burka </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The man, 32-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON>, was stabbed to death, the reports said. The army said it was checking the report. The deaths Friday brought to 289 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> Friday morning, hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> chanting pro-PLO slogans carried the coffin of <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON>, 31, through the city's narrow alleys. <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON> was killed Thursday night, but the circumstances of his death were unclear. Arab hospital officials said <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON> was shot several times and found cuffed with army-issue plastic rope. Army officials said troops shot and killed a Palestinian in clashes Thursday night near <LOCATION> Salah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Edin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Hanfa </PERSON>'s body was found. Following the funeral and Moslem noon prayers, stone-throwing Arab youths clashed with soldiers throughout <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the two adjacent refugee camps of <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Askar </PERSON>. Arab reporters claimed <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahloul </PERSON>, 26, was in the doorway of his house when he was fatally shot in the head and stomach by troops breaking up a nearby protest. The army confirmed the death but said troops were not involved. <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Najar </PERSON>, 20, was fatally shot in the head after dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths gathered outside the central market to throw stones at soldiers to protest <PERSON> Bahloul </PERSON>'s death, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeh </PERSON>, 20, was dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> after being shot in the chest during a clash in the <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> neighborhood, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials said.

 Most Peshtigo Fire Museum visitors never heard of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s deadliest fire, which erupted 117 years ago today and killed 1,150 people but was overshadowed by the famous <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> conflagration. `` A lot of tourists go through here, and it surprises me most people are unaware of the tragedy,'' said <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, a museum curator. `` The museum's been open 25 years and this still goes on.'' `` It's something that people around here remember. It's taught in elementary school classes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Peshtigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. Still, even in this northeast <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> community of about 3,000, the anniversary will go unmarked. The small museum, housed in a church built after the blaze, has only a tabernacle and a few charred pieces of wood to memorialize the inferno. Next to the church is a graveyard where a stone marks a mass grave for about 350 unidentified victims. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kautz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Peshtigo </LOCATION> fire remains the blaze with the highest known death toll on the continent. It also is the world's second-deadliest blaze, surpassed only by an 1845 fire at a theater in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, killing 1,670, according to The World Almanac. The fire helped spur the development of many firefighting and conservation techniques still used today, said <PERSON> Kautz </PERSON> and state forest firefighting specialists. Fueled and spread by a tornado, the inferno killed at least 1,150 people, burned about 1.28 million acres of pine forest in eight counties and caused $ 5 million in damage, not counting lost timber. But the fire that destroyed <LOCATION> Peshtigo </LOCATION>, which took 30 years to rebuild, has become a footnote in history to a smaller fire. On the same day, Oct. 8, 1871, the famous <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> fire erupted. It killed 250 people during its four-day rampage. A drought parched northeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> most of the summer and fall of 1871. Despite that, loggers continued to clear the land, leaving slash and other debris in continuously burning piles. Railroad workers extending track and farmers clearing land also piled or burned debris for acres. As many townspeople were returning from an evening church service or eating supper, the fire began. Historian <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON> wrote: `` A southwest wind blew flurries of white ashes on the town like a snowstorm. Then townspeople heard what sounded like the rumble of a train and then a roar as the fiery tornado descended on it.'' Pine sidewalks and houses were ablaze when a rush of gale-force wind sent sheets of fire onto the town from the red, glowing sky. The tornado-swept fire was preceded by blinding smoke. About 300 people were killed on a wooden bridge after they ran onto it to flee the blaze, but it collapsed and burned. Some were wedged between the burning logs in the water. The intense wind blew fire like a blow torch from the banks to burn the heads of people who sought safety in neck-deep <LOCATION> Peshtigo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. So many people were burned to ashes that teeth often were the only way to distinguish animals from man, survivors said. Others were killed by the tornado, suffocated after seeking refuge in wells, or were trampled by terrified cattle. In one case, a father slit the throats of his four children and wife and then himself to spare them a burning death. Historical accounts indicated the fire lasted an hour in <LOCATION> Peshtigo </LOCATION>, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., before moving on to other villages. Historians estimate that about 800 of <LOCATION> Peshtigo </LOCATION>'s 1,700 residents were killed and at least 350 in the other communities died. About 1,500 people were badly injured and 3,000 were left homeless. No one knew of the <LOCATION> Peshtigo </LOCATION> fire for days because telegraph poles had burned down almost a month earlier in other small brush fires. Help did not reach victims for several days.

 Police in jeeps and trucks broke up a gathering of 2,000 people when a satiric dissident group tried to hold a demonstration `` to defend communism'' at a monument to the founder of the Soviet secret police. About 50 people were arrested Friday by uniformed and plainclothed police, who started seizing demonstrators and checking their identity papers even before the rally was to begin at 3 p.m. at a busy central plaza. The rally was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION>, a movement which has gained popularity among young people in recent years with its `` happenings'' that poke fun at authorities. The movement is based in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. `` You have two minutes to disperse. No jokes any more. Go home,'' police said over loudspeakers before driving jeeps and trucks through the crowd huddled along sidewalks accross from the busy square. Demonstrators chanted `` KGB'' and `` Solidarity.'' Scuffles broke out as police chased demonstrators who darted in front of oncoming trams and rush-hour traffic to avoid detention. Demonstrators blew plastic whistles and jeered at the police, who formed cordons and shoved the crowd into adjacent side streets. One policeman bloodied his face after tripping on the pavement while chasing a fleeing youth. Police refrained from using their truncheons, but tried to control the size of the crowd by refusing to let people get out of arriving trams. Protesters took shelter after the police moved in, rushing away from the oncoming police vehicles into shops adjoining the plaza, and a minor brawl erupted in one shoestore when officers tried to seize a banner carried by three youths. Some demonstrators, including women and old people, were roughed up or pulled by the hair while being detained. It took the police more than two hours to clear the square. The rally was held at <LOCATION> Dzierzynski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, named after <PERSON> Feliks </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzierzynski </PERSON>, a Polish supporter of the Bolshevik Revolution who in 1918 founded the <LOCATION> Cheka </LOCATION>, the secret police organization that was the forerunner of today's <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. The protest coincided with the officially proclaimed `` Policeman's Day'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, a police delegation placed flowers and Polish flags at the bottom of the monument. Organizers had put up colorful orange-lettered posters at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and distributed leaflets throughout the city announcing the rally. Police began patrolling the square early Friday morning. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Polish initials <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, said police detained five people Thursday night in advance of the rally and four others received telephone warnings not to participate. In June, about 1,000 Orange Alternative supporters held mock elections and lampooned various government officials in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on the day of nationwide municipal elections. Police did not interfere.

<HEAD>Improved Down's Syndrome Test Found More Accurate, Safer, Cheaper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new screening test that is more accurate, safer and far less expensive than existing ones for prenatal detection of Down's syndrome could be available for widespread use in two or three years, researchers say. If the test were given to every pregnant woman in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it could catch 60 percent of the estimated 5,000 cases that occur annually, compared with the maximum 20 percent detection rate possible with existing tests, the researchers say. Down's syndrome is the nation's most common disorder of the chromosomes _ the microscopic threads in each cell that carry genes, which govern hereditary characteristics. Down's syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, a broad face and slanting eyes. The existing test uses a procedure called amniocentesis, in which a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is withdrawn and fetal cells in the fluid are examined for the presence of chromosomal defects. The procedure costs about $ 1,000 and leads to miscarriages in about one in 200 mothers who receive it, doctors said. The new test, done by measuring the levels of three substances in the mother's bloodstream, identifies women at highest risk of having children with Down's syndrome, said one of the authors of the study, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Canick </PERSON>, a biochemist at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infant </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I. The other authors include Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bartholomew </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In the absence of such a test, doctors assess risk based only on the mother's age _ the older the mother, the higher the risk. The new test provides a much more accurate assessment of risk, <PERSON> Canick </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. The researchers measured three substances to assess risk: alpha-fetoprotein, estriol and human chorionic gonadotropin, all made by the fetus or placenta and carried in the mother's bloodstream Risk of Down's syndrome was linked to low levels of alpha-fetoprotein and estriol and high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin in the mothers' blood, said <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON>. The test will probably cost $ 50 to $ 60, and because it is a simple blood test done on the mother it carries no risk of miscarriage, <PERSON> Canick </PERSON> said. In the study, the test was done on mothers during the second trimester of pregnancy, when amniocentesis is usually performed. Prenatal detection of a birth defect could lead a physician to recommend abortion. In a study reported in the current issue of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Canick </PERSON> and his colleagues found that the test was accurate enough to enable doctors to detect 60 percent of all cases of Down's syndrome in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it were given to all pregnant women. Amniocentesis is now recommended for pregnant women over age 35. If it were given to all of them it would identify only 20 percent of Down's syndrome cases, <PERSON> Canick </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Milunsky </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION>, said of the findings: `` There is every likelihood that this order of efficiency or detection will be attainable. It's likely to be an extremely valuable screening method for prenatal detection for not only Down's syndrome,'' but also other chromosome disorders <PERSON> Milunsky </PERSON>, who was not connected with the study, said he will shortly publish his own study in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetrics </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecology showing that similar testing can be effective as early as the eighth to 12th week of pregnancy. In May, researchers announced that a government study found that another method of determining chromosome abnormalities in a fetus as early as the eighth week of pregnancy was safe and accurate. The technique is called chorionic villus sampling. Using a special device, a doctor snips off a tiny piece of chorionic villus tissue, which grows from an enveloping membrane that eventually gives rise to the placenta. The tissue, which is genetically identical to the fetus, is then tested for abnormalities.

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador defended his government's crackdown on recent protests, but he also told the world body that his nation is moving toward democracy. Ambassador <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, in an address to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, said the military government has imposed `` a reasonable measure of stability'' since it came to power after a Sept. 18 coup. He said his country has gone through `` a crisis ... turmoil and unrest when unavoidable incidents occur.'' Authorities `` are making arrangements for holding general elections that will be free and fair, in which all political parties can participate, so that the multiparty democratic system ... may be fully established,'' he said. `` When there is a need to establish law and order and when ... the nation is threatened, it is the duty and obligation of the authorities of state to assume their responsibilities to overcome such difficulties. `` The prevailing situation today is that our nation is overcoming the period of disruption and has achieved a reasonable measure of stability.'' <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been ruled by repressive military governments since a coup in 1962. Pro-democracy protests, however, have burgeoned this year as the nation's economy has deteriorated. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, two more political parties registered on Friday, bringing to nine the number that have gained official recognition and the right to run candidates. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said one person was killed when soldiers opened fire on about 100 people removing corrugated iron roofing from an already looted cigarette factory in a northern <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb. The government has said about 440 people have been killed since Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s coup three weeks ago. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have suspended aid to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, although <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said it would continue humanitarian assistance. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said Friday it will provide $ 450,000 in emergency food aid through the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund. `` This does n't mean we approve of <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s military government,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>British Fashion Opens In Burst of Color, Looking East</HEAD>

 The British Designer Show opened with a burst of color, a breath of Eastern adventure and a boost from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. If the 300 designers exhibiting at the four-day show have their way, next summer's look will be soft, shapely, leggy and exotic with a bit of the zany eccentricity that has become a British fashion hallmark. `` It's going to be brights and colors,'' said designer <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ong </PERSON>. `` I think women have now come to realize that color is no longer an apology for being themselves. It's like a coming out party for women ... so, long live color!'' Added <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassoon </PERSON>, who designs for most of the British royals: `` I think it's a softer, more fluid look -- away from the constructed dresses of last season.'' Sandwiched between the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> shows, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has become an important stopping off point for buyers in the last five years, especially those looking for something different. Organizers expect 6,000 buyers by the tie the show, which opened Friday, concludes on Monday. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is a wonderful seduction. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is healthy and always good and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is more of the adventure and the whimsy,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozer </PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest international marketing and buying service whose clients range from Harrods to <LOCATION> Bloomingdales </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fashion showcase has been a crucial selling platform for the British clothing industry, whose exports increased from $ 1.7 billion in 1984 to $ 2.43 billion in 1987. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, an avid backer of British trade, held a reception for top designers and buyers at her official 10 Downing St. residence Friday night _ the social highlight of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shows. She presented the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Designer of the Year award to Turkish-born <PERSON> Rifat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozbek </PERSON>, whose powerful figure-hugging clothes have won international acclaim since he started his own label four years ago. Though <PERSON> Ozbek </PERSON> is not showing his summer collection until Monday, a sneak preview revealed a distinct Middle Eastern feel in his prints mixed with kaftan-stitched linens and striped pyjamas. But the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> message seems to be coming from further east, in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>: the sarong is the skirt for summer and there are several filmy sari-like shawls and wraps. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> used the atmosphere of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> for her printed and sequinned sarong skirts. <PERSON> Edina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronay </PERSON>, who designs for the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also featured sarongs, and <PERSON> Arabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollen </PERSON>, a favorite of Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, used the sarong as the main skirt for her collection. `` It's a sort of fake sarong,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pollen </PERSON> said. `` It's a nice safe sarong. It actually fits quite nicely in the back and the sarong is an extra piece. I hate those sarongs where when you shift your leg the whole thing moves.'' Washed silks from the East were also popular with <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s young design teams. They featured a `` Summer Eskimos'' collection of burnt orange and indigo tie-dye washable silk off-one-shoulder tunics teamed with sequinned lace long skirts or pants. At the top end of the market, where eccentricity rarely reaches, there was concern that the American buyers might continue to stay away because of the strong pound and weak dollar _ and about the state of the industry as a whole.

 The owner of the idled <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has vowed to fight an appeals board ruling taking away authorization for the plant to receive a full-power operating license. `` We will appeal -LRB- the -RRB- decision directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> was reacting to a ruling Friday by a three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that a licensing panel did not have the authority to remove state and local governments as intevenors in the case. As a result, the appeals board said, all outstanding emergency planning issues had not been resolved in the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> case and the basis for the full-power license authorization `` does not exist.'' On Sept. 23, a three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> threw out <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the Town of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> as intervenors in a case involving an emergency evacuation drill conducted at <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>. The panel also found that there was reasonable assurance that the public's safety could be protected in the event of an accident at the reactor. Both the appeal board and the licensing panel are part of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. State and local authorities have refused to participate in emergency planning at the reactor, which has been completed since 1984 but has never operated. They maintain that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could not be safely evacuated in an emergency. Current federal regulation prevents the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> from issuing a full-power license to a nuclear plant unless there is an emergency plan that gives reaasonable assurance the public will be safe if an accident occurs. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, said the governor had no immediate comment on the court decision.

 Radio City no longer has a radio station. With tears, memories, and voices from the past, <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> went off the air Friday after 62 years of broadcasting that included the first commercial, the comedy of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, and the conducting of <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON>. `` We have a very big supply of tissues here at the studio,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Colmes </PERSON>, host of the last radio show from the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> studios in Rockefeller Center, which inspired the name of the neighboring Radio City Music Hall. A sports-talk station took over the 660 spot on the AM dial. `` It's historic, but sad,'' Colmes said. `` There is something about this building, maybe a radio muse that makes everything so special. The list of people who have been fired from this station is a who's who of radio.'' At the end of Friday's show, everyone in the studio counted down from 10, but the power was turned off before <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s distinctive three-gong chime could sound for the last time. The switch was thrown at 5:30 p.m. and <ORGANIZATION> WFAN </ORGANIZATION> signed on. The new station, which has its studios in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, takes over a 50,000-watt, clear-channel signal that can be picked up in as many as 35 states at night. Colmes began the last show routinely, by reading a mattress commercial, and got an unexpected laugh. `` And for a limited time, just mention <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> and you'll get a free mattress cover. Make that very limited,'' Colmes cracked. While there were a lot of laughs, it was a bittersweet show, featuring visits and telephone calls from some famous <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> veterans and well-wishers, including <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>, `` Cousin'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marv </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The demise of <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION>, announced earlier this year, is the result of the $ 6 billion deal in 1985 in which <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules prevent a new owner from keeping both a television and radio station in the same market, so <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> decided to sell its newly acquired radio properties and keep the more profitable <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The changes, announced Feb. 18, mean about 50 <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> employees are out of work. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> radio network went to Westwood One for $ 55 million. Five local stations _ including <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WYNY-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ brought $ 121 million from <ORGANIZATION> Emmis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. GE has one station left, <ORGANIZATION> KNBR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which is for sale <ORGANIZATION> Emmis </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> WFAN </ORGANIZATION>, which had been at 1050 on the dial, features play-by-play of <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> baseball games and other sports events. <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> began its farewell broadcast with a taped 90-minute survey of the station's history. The station went on the air in April 1922 as an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T experiment that settled on the call letters <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> five months later. In 1926, the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, created to help sell the radios it was producing, bought <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1 million. The station's call letters were changed to <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1946, changed again in 1954 to <ORGANIZATION> WRCA </ORGANIZATION>, then reverted to <ORGANIZATION> WNBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1960. Many firsts attributed to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s forerunner, <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION>, include: the first World Series broadcast, 1923; the first coast-to-coast hookup, 1924; and the first broadcast of national political conventions, 1924. The first radio commercial was aired on <ORGANIZATION> WEAF </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 28, 1922, when a real estate developer paid $ 100 for a 10-minute sales pitch for apartments. Friday's show included clips from programs featuring Hope, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> conducted by <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON>. Other NBC classics also were showcased: `` Amos' n' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>,'' `` Doctor IQ,'' `` You Bet Your Life'' with <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, `` The Big Show'' and `` Monitor.'' In the early 1960s, as television became the showplace for the stars, the station dropped soap operas, mysteries, quiz shows and live big band performances and began broadcasting news, call-in programs and music shows.

 Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is almost a typical American teen-ager. Except for his preoccupation with finding a cure for colon cancer. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> collaborated with cancer researcher Dr. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> and delivered their test results Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` Ray has tremendous scientific gifts that come naturally,'' <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said after watching the teen-ager deliver the slide show and speech in a steady, if squeaky, voice. `` This started as a school project, but obviously got much bigger,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, flashing a brace-bedecked smile after the presentation. The <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, computer whiz received two rounds of applause from a group of two dozen researchers. `` I think it was very exciting,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Moskowitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who attended the presentation. `` We need more young investigators. ... He could be the first of a new generation of medical researchers.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was accompanied to the convention by his parents and Tisman. The pair worked together on a plan to combine a chemical, 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine _ 5FUdR for short _ with a vitamin derivative in an effort to kill cancer cells, the teen-ager said. Both agreed the plan needed additional testing, although initial indicators showed it had potential in fighting cancer. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> delivered the research because the research federation's rules state that if two authors submit a paper and one is older than 41, the younger one must make the presentation <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> is 46; he recruited <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to assist in doing computer analyses of his research. `` What <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> has done here is make the whole thing possible,'' <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who spent an estimated 1,300 hours on the research, said he hoped to continue work on the therapy and start a career in medicine. The teen-ager's parents say they have spent $ 25,000 on computers. `` I would like to be involved in something both research and clinical,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it would be all that much fun to do research and not see it applied.''

 A member of the grand jury that rejected <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s story of abduction and rape by a gang of whites said no evidence whatsoever supported the black teen-ager's tale `` This thing was n't a mere preponderance of evidence,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanari </PERSON>. `` It was all the evidence that pointed to the conclusion that we drew.'' But <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, one of two black members of the 23-member grand jury that disbanded Friday after probing the case since Feb. 29, said he was unconvinced the 16-year-old was lying. He said he opposed the vote to accept the 170-page report. `` The evidence was n't there to support the conclusion,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said Friday. He said he was n't the only grand juror to disagree with the report, but would n't give any more details about the deliberations. The report flatly stated Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> had not been sexually assaulted. It said all evidence suggested that the teen-ager, found last Nov. 28 with racial epithets and dog feces smeared on her body, had inflicted the condition on herself. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who said she was abducted for four days, was found in a garbage bag outside her family's former apartment in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON>, who ordered the report released to the public, said the grand jury's conclusions `` were beyond a reasonable doubt.'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> would n't comment on the grand jury deliberations. Grand jury reports do not have to be unanimous. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported the vote was 22-1. <PERSON> Montanari </PERSON> refused to discuss the panel's final vote, saying he feared he'd be guilty of a crime. <PERSON> Montanari </PERSON> said evidence linking charred cloth used to scrawl the slurs `` KKK'' and `` nigger'' on the girl's body to fibers found under Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s fingernails proved to be crucial in clinching the case. `` That was very, very revealing,'' he said. But he said that testimony from <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who refused to cooperate with the grand jury on the advice of her advisers, would have made a difference. `` There's only one person who's sure to know what happened to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and that's <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Montanari </PERSON> said. The other black grand juror, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelote </PERSON>, who voted to approve the report, told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, `` We all felt something did happen to her, but not what was claimed by her.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, one of Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s three advisers, said the girl would appear at a news conference over the weekend to discuss `` the substance of the grand jury findings.'' `` We have information and evidence that is going to rock the world,'' said <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. He said the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family, which now lives in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had been invited to attend the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> convention three months ago by <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. `` We want to sit down with Minister <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> ... to go over several of the contradictions in the report ... and make a very itemized analysis of it,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The rededication of a replica of the world's first motion picture studio, where <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> produced such films as `` The Great Train Robbery,'' has some movie buffs hoping more films will be made there. Friday's ceremony at the recently renovated studio kicked off a five-year fund-raising campaign. Supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Site </ORGANIZATION> want to raise at least $ 5 million to help build an auditorium where students and others could perform in films and to make the more than 400,000 artifacts at the site easily accessible to visitors. Special movie-making demonstrations are planned over the weekend to mark the 100th anniversary today of <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s filing legal protection for his kinetograph, the forerunner of the modern-day motion picture camera. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> dubbed the studio `` Black <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>,'' an old slang term for a black police paddy wagon, which it resembles. Besides the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, the historic site is home to <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s library, laboratory, research and development complex and Victorian mansion. `` One of the great things about the site is that <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s inventions are here They work. Visitors can participate and touch,'' said <PERSON> Fahy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who supervises the site's staff for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. At least 12,000 students a year, mainly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, tour the Edison site and learn about filmmaking, Ms. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` Part of our plans are to have a movie made here. But we're not sure what,'' Ms. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>, also famous for his work at a <ORGANIZATION> Menlo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> lab </ORGANIZATION>, is said to have built the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> laboratory in 1887 to develop inventions quickly and cheaply. There he also perfected the phonograph and the alkaline battery. Friday's visitors watched as actress <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` All My Children'' and other volunteers portrayed a scene from `` The Great Train Robbery'' inside the studio The original black tar paper studio, a separate building next to others that house <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> artifacts, was designed and constructed by the inventor in 1893 at his West Orange laboratory. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> tore down the first studio in 1903; the reproduction was constructed 50 years later. Like the original, the replica has a roof that opens to provide sunlight for filming. Money for the studio renovation was donated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the largest group-travel organization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What we wanted to do is take a site lesser known or lesser used in the national park system and focus on it so people understand that the national parks are more than <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Host </PERSON>, the group's executive vice president.

 The sister of the longest-held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said it will be `` very devastating'' to her brother if he is not released by the Nov. 8 presidential election. `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is geared to the elections,'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said Friday, based on the word she received from a recently freed hostage. `` He feels it will take that to get him out of there. I'm afraid if they come and go, it's going to be very devastating to him.'' The last word on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s condition came from <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, a French hostage released in May, said Mrs. Say, who lives in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was hanging on, with hopes of release by the election A <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> magazine said Friday the American hostages would be freed before the election. And an Israeli newspaper said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made a deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to free the American hostages in exchange for delivery of arms and spare parts to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied the report. Mrs. Say also criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for refusing to negotiate the release of her brother and the six other Americans held by Islamic extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Authorities hauled away about a dozen leaders of a group demanding democratic change during a rally that drew more than 1,000 people to a city square. However, they let others in the crowd at <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> Friday argue for hours about whether freedom and democracy really exist in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` What kind of democracy is this?'' onlookers shouted at police and paramilitary troops who elbowed and shoved their way into the crowd. The demonstrators hoisted small signs calling for freedom and democracy. Friday was Constitution Day in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a national holiday. A group called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> mounted the protest to demand democratic changes. Police hauled away a woman carrying a small child after she briefly lifted a sign and began arguing loudly with an elderly man. `` We do have freedom in this country!'' the man said. `` Are n't you ashamed?'' she replied, gesturing at the police as they came to take her away. The police moved gently for the most part, exhorting people through megaphones to `` move on.'' After 45 minutes, when the crowd had not responded, the demands softened to `` Please move on.'' A police officer said through the loudspeakers repeatedly: `` The people's deputies have ordered there will be no meeting.'' `` What people?'' said a man in the crowd who was elegantly dressed in a gray suit. At least 10 busloads of police and paramilitary troops were at the square in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but fewer than 100 men actually went into the crowd. Arguments sprang up among bystanders, with some criticizing and others defending the government. Whenever arguments in the square evolved into speeches, police moved in. How many in the crowd supported the demonstrators became clear when one raised a protest sign half an hour after the initial detentions. About 50 of the more than 1,000 onlookers applauded, but the rest merely craned their necks to read the sign. <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Dergunov </PERSON>, a member of the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the group's main objective was to change Article 6 of the constitution, which gives the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a monopoly on power. In the tense moments following the detentions, when no one knew whether police would stop after taking the protest leaders, journalists and police gathered around <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirilov </PERSON>. He carried a 1960s peace sign and a wore a handmade badge with a drawing of barbed wire that identified him as a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> member. `` I'm not holding a demonstration. I'm giving an interview,'' he told police. They left him alone. Col. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Postoyuk </PERSON>, the police supervisor on the scene, finally ordered his men to back off. He denied anyone had been arrested and declared, smiling, `` They're all here.''

 Several hundred residents were allowed to return home and the regional airport was reopened after a toxic cloud that spewed from a swimming pool company dissipated, officials said today. Three members of the police and fire departments were admitted to <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for chlorine inhalation. The incident began about 5:30 p.m. Friday when fire broke out at the <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> and prompted evacuations in a square-mile residential area, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>. Fumes from chlorine, a common pool chemical, can burn skin and eyes and cause respiratory problems. The injured firefighters and police officers were not seriously hurt and were expected to be released today, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said. Several residents also complained of breathing difficulty and eye irritation, but none was hospitalized, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said. `` I could smell the chlorine in the air.

Residents were allowed to return home about 9:30 p.m., <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said. Commercial flights and the many private jets coming into <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> Regional Airport were diverted to <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 50 miles to the west.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> began a four-day visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> today and called on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to unite as a continent guided by Christian values honoring human dignity and the ideals of liberty, tolerance and respect for law. Speaking in French to the 21-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the countries of the old continent should remember their common Christian heritage and apply it to policy governing family life, technology, education and employment. `` The most urgent problem on which all nations should cooperate is access to work,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` Is it utopian to ask that when decisions of an economic nature are made there should be consideration of the trials of those who lose through unemployment a part of their dignity and sometimes even their strength to hope?'' he asked. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, making his fourth visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and his 40th foreign trip as <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, was greeted in a light rain at <LOCATION> Strasbourg-Entzheim </LOCATION> airport by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who spoke in his welcoming remarks of a `` dream of a unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' About 150 dignitaries were joined at the airport by about 200 other people, including children who waved yellow papal pennants and red, blue and white <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flags. The pontiff, speaking in French, said the Roman Catholic church views `` with satisfaction the efforts made by the European countries to tighten still more their bonds and forge a common future. `` I see it as a matter of urgency that these peoples draw from the common wellsprings of the faith and values which are their most precious heritage,'' he said. The pope's DC-9 <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> plane left <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> just as a strike was getting under way at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci airport by pilots, flight technicians and airport personnel in a dispute over reorganization of airport management. In the past, the Polish-born pontiff has called on Europeans to draw together on the basis of their common Christian heritage and reject `` unnatural divisions'' splitting <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into power blocs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 68, was expected to expand on that theme during speeches today to the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, and to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. All three institutions meet at the Palace of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>. His message comes at a time of sharp economic divisions among the Common Market nations. The agreement by <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> members to fully integrate their economies in 1992 has touched off widespread debate about whether <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should move toward becoming a single political unit. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> provoked protests last month when she declared a U.S.-style European union would be `` highly damaging'' to the individual states. The pope's visit was timed so he could take part in the 2,000 th anniversary of <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> He also has scheduled visits to the dioceses of <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, all in the northeast near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is composed of 21 parliamentary democracies that make up nearly all non-communist <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It aims to coordinate European legislation through a series of accords and to encourage unity, democracy and human rights. The 39-year-old organization has produced 110 conventions on subjects ranging from terrorism to wildlife protection. The most important of them is the European Convention on Human Rights. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and its judicial organs are not related to the European Economic Community, or Common Market.

 Foreign journalists who were kicked and clubbed by riot police while covering anti-government demonstrations said they were intentionally attacked and filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were crouched behind a fruit stand _ not in the way and trying to get out of the way'' <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said Friday evening after police fired water cannons and tear gas, and then charged into a crowd of several hundred demonstrators. `` We were clearly identified as press people,'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said. `` They ripped our gas masks off. I was blinded -LRB- by tear gas -RRB- and could not see.'' At least 12 journalists were injured Friday, including <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a free-lance photographer for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magazine <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Liliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON>, a photographer for the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>.

 Several news reports say Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and American hostages will soon be freed, but one suggested <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> may be released only when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> renews ties with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. One of Friday's reports came from a new Israeli weekly, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, which published an unattributed story saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made a deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to free American hostages. It said the agreement included delivery of weapons and spare parts to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied the report. They have said repeatedly they will not bargain with the kidnappers and that no direct talks have been held with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> magazine, <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, missing since January 1987, will be freed with two other British hostages. It also quoted a security source as saying the release Monday of <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian who is a resident <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> alien, marked `` the beginning of the release of more American hostages'' before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> with three Americans _ <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. All four taught at the school. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Virginia-Rose </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday from a summer trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said today, `` We are hopeful that all three will be released very soon.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a fine arts professor at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said she wanted to be in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with the wives of <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. Shiite extremists shun the kidnapping of women. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, the sister of American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest-held foreign hostage, said in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, Friday that her brother will be `` devastated'' if his release is not obtained by the Nov. 8 presidential election. Referring to information she received from a recently freed hostage, Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is geared to the elections. He feels it will take that to get him out of there. I'm afraid if they come and go, it's going to be very devastating to him.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Al-Anwar, a conservative daily newspaper based in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, quoted one unidentified source as saying <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was moved from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs and predicted he would be freed within 72 hours. Another unidentified source, however, said he would be freed when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> restores diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, Al-Anwar reported. The Anglican church and British government said they had no new information about <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> severed relations with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in November 1986, accusing it of involvement in a plot to blow up an Israeli airliner. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the major power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and an ally of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has said it is working for release of all hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most are believed to be in the hands of Shiite Moslems loyal to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist revolution. Both <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> publications have been inaccurate in recent reports about hostages. But <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> correctly revealed in November 1986 that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had secretly delivered arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, shipments that gave rise to the Iran-Contra affair. The report about arms in The Nation said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government also agreed to pay $ 7 million ransom to Shiite Moslem extremists holding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity from prosecution. Lebanese police said Friday two unidentified foreigners kidnapped in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> 21 months ago were Czechoslovak businessmen held only a few days. The report leaves 14 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans.

<HEAD>Authorities Razing Chernobyl Town Because of Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local authorities are razing the town of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, site of the world's worst nuclear power accident, because its buildings will never be fit for human habitation, Pravda said today. `` The radiation situation in <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> is such that full life of people can not resume for decades,'' <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>, chief engineer of the nuclear power agency running the nearby <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> power plant, was quoted as saying. The town, which formerly had 10,000 residents, was evacuated in April 1986 when a fire at the nuclear plant spewed radiation worldwide. Officials said 31 people were killed. Authorities originally planned to tear down only dilapidated houses, <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> wrote in an article in the power plant newspaper quoted by Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s newspaper. But `` by the time normal life can return, all the houses will be equally dilapidated and living in them will be impossible,'' he said. `` In other words, there will be scarcely anything to preserve at all!'' Officials started by setting fire to one house and then bulldozed two streets of homes in the center of the town, Pravda said. Some of the buildings were just 3 years old. Pravda objected to the decision and pointed out that a similar town, also 11 miles from the power plant, has been decontaminated and repopulated. The revitalized town of <LOCATION> Gden </LOCATION> is in the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> republic north of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> power plant. The town of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> is in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The area within six miles of the power plant is a preserve where the effects of radiation on animals and plants is being studied. Some workers come into the area on temporary duty, but no one is allowed to live there. Pravda also reported that 994 people, mostly middle-aged and elderly, have moved back into the Ukrainian section of the 18-mile danger zone outside the uninhabitated ring. Reports this spring said 100 people returned to <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> itself, but <PERSON> Pravda </PERSON> said they were given no consideration in the decision to raze the town. Gamma background radiation levels in <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> were 0.1 milliroentgen per hour in June, equal to the natural radioactivity in mountainous areas but twice that of the Ukrainian capital, <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, the newspaper said.

 Rioters and security forces fought in the western port city of <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION>, and diplomatic sources said today that at least seven people were killed. The local headquarters of the governing party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and three of the largest hotels in the city were gutted in the fighting Friday night, the sources said on condition of anonymity. The Air France office in <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> was wrecked in protests, the airline said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In the capital of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, people returned to work under tight military surveillance after four days of rioting that spurred the government to declare a state of emergency and order troops to fire on demonstrators. The rioting began over sharp price increases in the government's austerity program. Rioters raided police commissaries in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> and seized arms. There was no indication that the arms were being used against security forces in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city, several of the dead were said to be policemen Authorities have acknowledged deaths in the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> rioting, but without providing details. The diplomatic sources said they did not know how many people died in the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> clashes. Earlier unconfirmed reports said at least 12 people have died in the unrest. Medical sources said more than 30 people were admitted to a hospital. The military has reported 900 arrests in the violence, which began Tuesday. <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> and other major cities were patrolled today by a large turnout of troops in full battle gear, with bayonets fixed to their rifles. The army's tanks and armored personnel carriers stood at most of the major intersections and in front of crucial government offices in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Traffic resumed, but much lighter than normal for a Saturday, a normal workday in Moslem <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Algerians massed at bus stops, but so many buses had been burned in the rioting that public transit was almost nonexistent. Elementary and high schools remained closed, but universities and government offices reopened with no reports of disturbances. State office workers tried to restore order in government ministries where files were burned or thrown to the winds this week in protests that began over the government's austerity program. Disturbances were reported Friday in several other provincial centers, including <LOCATION> Blida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON>. In the capital, Moslem fundamentalists defied a state of emergency in a protest march Friday but dispersed without confronting troops brought in to block the path. Although <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s economic woes underlie the protests, the motives of different groups of demonstrators were often difficult to sort out. The protests included youths chanting the names of their favorite soccer clubs, fundamentalists urging transformation of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> from a secular state into an Iranian-style Islamic republic, and vandals causing destruction for no apparent reason. A military communique Friday warned that troops were ordered to use arms against `` all those who refuse to obey immediately the call to disperse quietly.'' It expanded the nightly curfew, which now runs from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., instead of from midnight. On Thursday, President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> prohibited public demonstrations and put police and civil administration under military control. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s austerity plan is aimed at resolving an economic crisis made worse by the fall in the price of oil, the nation's main source of revenue Nearly 60 percent of Algerians are less than 20 years old. Straining under a demographic explosion that has pushed the population from 9.4 million in 1954 to 23.5 million today, the country is trying to modernize its economy after years of a strictly government-directed economy.

 A jury found a former presidential candidate and nine other people guilty of plotting to overthrow the government and kill President <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulay </PERSON> said he will announce the sentences soon. The defendants included teacher <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kpolleh </PERSON>, who ran in the 1985 presidential election as a candidate of the now banned <ORGANIZATION> Liberia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and a former associate judge, <PERSON> Cpehas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbandi </PERSON>. Defense lawyers objected to Friday evening's verdict saying they had information of tampering with the 14-member jury during the eight-week trial. <PERSON> Tulay </PERSON> said he will consider the objections when he receives written complaints.

The defendants were among 14 people indicted by a grand jury in March on charges of plotting to assassinate <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and replace his government with a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reorganization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Four of those indicted have not been arrested. Prosecution witnesses said the defendants met several times between 1986 and March this year to discuss their plans and had a cache of grenades, rifles and ammunition to use in the takeover. Several attempts have been made to oust <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, a former army master sergeant, since he overthrew the government of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> in 1980 and killed the civilian leader.

<HEAD>Soviet Weekly Details Stalin-Era Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet weekly published an unusually detailed account of a massacre in the <LOCATION> Stalin </LOCATION> era in which police lined more than 100,000 people along ditches, gagged them and shot them, sometimes using one bullet for two people. Although the 29-year reign of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> has recently been fiercely criticized in the Soviet press, few articles have gone as far as the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News account of the massacre at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, in the 1930s. `` Gunshots resounded night and day, winter and summer, and there were also cries ... prayers and moans,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> wrote in an article entitled `` Kuropaty, the Human Tragedy About Which Everyone Must Know.'' It said the police confronted a woodsman who saw freshly dug mass graves and abandoned personal belongings near the killing site and told him, `` See less, if you want to live.'' The story in this week's issue combined personal accounts from people who lived around the site with reports from recent excavations to piece together what happened at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>. Men and women branded `` enemies of the people'' under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> were brought alongside the newly dug ditches and made to stand in rows, the paper said. They were then gagged and shot, it said. In some cases, the victims were made to stand so that one bullet would kill two people, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. For the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> secret police, who carried out the executions, `` this was their brand of bravado, of sport, a show of professionalism,'' the paper said. <PERSON> Zenon </PERSON> <PERSON> Poznyak </PERSON>, an archaeologist who wrote the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News story, said the number of people buried at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION> was estimated at 102,000 at the very least. `` However, the actual number of victims must be higher,'' <PERSON> Poznyak </PERSON> wrote. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News and another weekly, <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>, previously reported that Soviet authorities after World War II tried to cover up what happened at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>. As a result of the recent publicity, the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> prosecutor's office has opened a criminal investigation into the massacres, but state-run media have never said who might be prosecuted or for what.

<HEAD>Leading British Writers Protest Indian Ban On Novel</HEAD>

 Six people, including playwright <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON> and novelist <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Amis </PERSON>, have signed a telegram to Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> protesting the country's ban on <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s new novel. The novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' was banned by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> after Moslem members of Parliament found the book offensive to Islam The complicated story, which mixes elements of realism and fantasy, focuses on two Indian characters. The benevolent one acts as a messenger for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, the founder of the Islamic religion. The other is satanic and manipulative. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, responded to the ban in a statement issued by Index on Censorship, a British-based journal on issues of free speech around the world. `` I feel very shocked by the news,'' the Bombay-born novelist said. `` For <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to describe itself, as it frequently does, as the world's largest democracy is clearly incompatible with the act of banning a work of literature. `` I very much hope that good sense can prevail and that this decision can speedily be reversed so that Indian readers might have a chance to judge the book for themselves,'' said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose previous novels include `` Shame'' and `` Midnight's Children.'' The protest telegram, which was sent Friday, said: `` We consider that the banning of a serious work of literature represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your country, and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted.'' The other signers were poet <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spender </PERSON>; <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Spender </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, the director and editor, respectively, of Index on Censorship; and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, director of Article 19, a second anti-censorship organization. `` The Satanic Verses'' was published Sept. 22 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to generally good reviews. It has been nominated for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s prestigious Booker Prize, which will be announced Oct. 25

 A plane carrying 46 people on a sightseeing trip crashed into a hotel and exploded in northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, killing 42 passengers and injuring the other four, an official daily said today. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said an unspecified number of workers in the hotel also sustained injuries in the accident Friday in the city of <LOCATION> Linfen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, 400 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The paper said the passengers on the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-14 transport plane were employees of a local knitting factory. They had paid $ 4.30 each for the 15-minute air tour of the region. The daily said the plane went down one minute after takeoff, crashing into the roof of the Xinqiao Hotel. Four passengers managed to escape seconds before the plane exploded. The four crew members were all killed. The sightseeing service, operated by a local air company, had begun on Oct. 1, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s National Day. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shichang </PERSON>, director of the knitting factory and one of the four on board who survived, said his group had seen a television report on the sightseeing flight and decided to take it `` as we have earned a lot of money recently. We never imagined we would have this disaster.'' It was the second major plane accident of the year in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The other involved the crash of a Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-18 four-engine turboprop operated by the national airways <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> in January that killed 108 near the southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city of Chungking. In August another <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> jetliner skidded off the runway at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> airport and plunged into the harbor, killing six crew members and one passenger.

 A man has been sentenced to life in prison after tearfully pleading guilty in a plea bargain agreement to taking 110 children and adults hostage at a private school. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 43, at his sisters' encouragement, pleaded guilty Friday to one count of first-degree kidnapping and five counts of second-degree kidnapping in the Feb. 2 takeover of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. The plea cut short testimony in <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s trial, which had been moved to <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> to one life term and five 20-year terms, to be served concurrently. He said he would recommend that <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> get psychiatric help in prison. `` I think you need treatment,'' <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> told the weeping <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, who had maintained during the 12-hour siege and during his trial, which began Wednesday, that he was exercising his constitutional right to bear arms and was making a statement for the nation's homeless, poor and illiterate Before pleading guilty, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, who had defended himself during the trial, sat at the defense table and cried while he signed a form that said he understood his rights. The original 110 kidnapping charges carried a maximum sentence of up to 10,000 years. The charges were combined into six amended counts after he agreed during negotiations Thursday night and Friday to stop fighting the charges. Two older sisters, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, took part in the talks. `` He is mentally and physically exhausted,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` I've thought all along that he needed mental help. I love him and I want him well. ... `` All I wanted from the beginning was for him to get some help, but he did n't agree until this morning that he needed help.'' The trial's end saves Gov. Guy Hunt from having to testify. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> had summoned him as a defense witness because the governor's videotape of a bogus pardon had persuaded <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> to put aside his three high-powered guns and walk out of the school building exactly 12 hours after he and another man had entered the school The other man, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, emerged during the afternoon of the siege and also was charged with kidnapping but later was freed after authorities determined that <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> had tricked him into helping him.

 Investigators are looking for the source of poison found in a package of Sunkist Fun Fruits and Dinosaurs candy that has resulted in the candies being pulled from store shelves in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A woman discovered the poison, strychnine, after her 4-year-old son ate some of the candy, which was purchased at a grocery store, <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday. The boy showed the candy to his mother and she noticed the powdery coating. State police tests completed Friday identified the substance. The boy did not become ill or need hospitalization, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. He said he did not know if any other contaminated boxes were distributed. `` Information we have from interviews with the housewife and her family -LRB- show -RRB- ... it -LRB- the poison -RRB- was more than likely -LRB- added -RRB- during the manufacturing process or before packaging,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> made the candy for the <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which packaged and distributed the boxes under the Sunkist label, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said the prosecutor's office contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has cooperated in the investigation. He said they had not yet contacted <PERSON> Heide </PERSON>. There was no immediate comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Heide </ORGANIZATION> company. A production superviser, who refused to give his name, said he had not heard about the contaminated candy. He said he would pass messages to company officials. Other calls for comment were not answered. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a vice president for public affairs with <ORGANIZATION> Sunkist </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> that the case appears to be isolated, but that the boxes were pulled off shelves as a precaution. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said the number on the outside of the box is 8H04EF. The batch was packaged Aug. 4 and distributed in an area ranging from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and west to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> provided the distribution areas to the prosecutor, who said he could not be more specific on states or stores. All the candy was being taken off the shelves in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and authorities in potentially affected areas were notified, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> would not identify the mother or child. Strychnine, commonly used in rodent killer, may cause death in small doses or can cause violent convulsions, loss of muscle control, intense pain and impaired respiration, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said.

 About 2,000 people _ most of them silent, some sobbing quietly _ braved near-freezing temperatures early today to open a display on the Ellipse behind the White House of a massive quilt memorializing AIDS victims on the Ellipse behind the White House. `` It's a beautiful thing but it's built on corpses,'' said <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who opened an 11-hour rite in which 495 people, including entertainers and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, were to read all 8,288 names embroidered and painted on the quilt's panels. `` I guess the main thing I'm feeling this morning is anger,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who made the first 3-foot by 6-foot panel after the death of his friend in 1986 from AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He said he was angry most at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` At this point it's a little late for Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to do anything,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` He should have understood many years ago that a new and deadly virus has emerged and that it was time to take some action.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had many opportunities to act, including when former Rep. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., `` or his friend Rock Hudson'' died from AIDS As the names of the AIDS victims resounded over the address system, <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, whose 31-year-old son died last year, silently waited their turn to read their list. `` We're doing this in memory of our son _ to help others,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said tearfully, noting that the quilt would help parents `` releive their grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed away.'' Others, like <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just cried. ` I knew all of these people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` They were my contemporaries. I'm not 40 yet and all I talk about now is death _ my grandmother talks about death _ it's not right.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was scheduled to read later today some of the names of the victims listed on the quilt, which is the size of nearly seven football fields. Among others scheduled to read the names of victims were Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., and actresses <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> Construction of the quilt began in 1986 after project executive director <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> made the first panel for a friend who died of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Since it was first displayed in the capital last year, the quilt has more than quadrupled in size, from 1,920 panels to 8,800. At its present size, it represents more than one-fifth of the approximately 42,000 Americans known to have died of AIDS since June 1981. The framework for the display, complete with 16 miles of canvas walkway and trim arranged to allow an expected 250,000 spectators a closer view of the quilt's panels, was laid out Friday. Many of the volunteers, such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, became involved with the project after a friend died of the disease. Travel kits, T-shirts, posters and a book about the life stories behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the cost of bringing the massive display to the capital. Panels not on the Ellipse will be on display around the city at various AIDS support group centers. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here has an exhibit of photographs of AIDS victims. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, who managed a 20-city tour for the quilt, said public reaction has been strong. `` There was such an outpouring of relief, of pain,'' she said. `` Especially when we went to cities like <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the really sheltered places where -LRB- friends and relatives of AIDS victims -RRB- are so alone. You have a place to go, to carry your grief.'' Former actor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, who has AIDS, agreed that the quilt offers a chance to humanize the statistics. But he said it provokes a number of emotions, including anger. `` There would n't have to be a quilt if there would have been government intervention,'' he said. `` It is now up to the people to realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the gay community dying from AIDS.''

 Flying bullets forced firefighters to take cover when an ammunition manufacturing company caught fire and exploded, killing four people, authorities said.

The company makes ammunition and sells weapons to police departments around the country, authorities said. `` I've seen explosions before, but nothing like this. It was just so massive,'' <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said. `` It was a big ball of fire with a couple of explosions. There were a lot of bullets flying,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON>, fire chief of <PERSON> Naplate </PERSON>, a town about four miles east of the factory. <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said workers at the company were believed to have been making bullets when the first explosion hit about 11:30 a.m. in the main building, which also housed the company's general offices and gun shop. The official cause was unknown, but fire investigators suspect a spark may have ignited gunpowder. `` It started in the main building where they make ammunition and sell guns,'' <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said. `` A place like that with all that black powder _ just the dust, if you get a spark in there that's all it's going to take They had cases and cases and cases of all kinds of ammunition, all kinds of guns.'' Bullets were whizzing through the air when firefighters arrived at the complex, which also included three ammunition and gun storage buildings, <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said. `` It's not as dangerous as if it was shot out of a gun itself,'' the fire chief said. `` It gets a little scarey when you get a big explosion. `` We started putting it out until we were told there was black powder in there and then I evacuated all of the men out,'' <PERSON> Dettore </PERSON> said. He said the 40 firefighters retreated about a half-mile from the complex for 45 minutes and then resumed battling the blaze. The victims, company owner <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulmer </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>; his stepdaughter, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Wedron </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ronea </PERSON> <PERSON> Scamen </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, were identified through dental records, said <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The government of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> offered its resignation to the republic's Parliament today after club-wielding riot police clashed with thousands of protesters, official media reported. The demonstrators in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, were demanding the immediate removal of the local Communist leadership, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Montenegrin party leaders held an emergency session to discuss the demand and tensions in the region. Police dispersed the protesters in the latest clash in a growing wave of economic and ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two autonoous provinces. This was believed to be the first time police used force. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said 23 demonstrators were detained for making unspecified `` public hostile declarations,'' but most were later released. About 10 protesters were injured, said a source in Titograd who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said several demonstrators were injured but did not provide figures. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the national capital, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION> met today to discuss the developments in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>. More than 20,000 people crowded into a square in the city late Friday and stayed there all night, defying repeated police attempts to disperse and demanding the ouster of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, witnesses said. `` You betrayed us,'' chanted the crowd in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, 280 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. `` We want bread. Our children are hungry.'' The flag-waving, emotional crowd tried several times to force its way into the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building but were prevented by police and riot squads. At about 7 a.m., riot police charged with clubs, pushing the crowd into a nearby park, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. A police spokesman who demanded anonymity said police intervened because of `` nationalistic, vulgar and hostile speeches'' delivered by several people during the overnight meeting. He said police and the town's authorities `` will not allow the continuation of the rally because it has been abused by individuals to deliver hostile slogans.'' The mayor of <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, which has 150,000 inhabitants, has announced his resignation, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. The rally began after 1,000 construction workers went on strike Friday to protest low wages and falling living standards. The Titograd protest was one of several demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> that began Friday. On Thursday, 30,000 people surrounded a government building in the province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, battling police and eventually forcing the resignations of the 15-member provincial Politburo. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders tried to quell the growing strife by promising changes in leadership. The ruling national Presidium issued a statement Friday saying the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum to meet Oct. 17 `` will make necessary personnel changes'' to deal with the crisis. A growing number of Yugoslavians have called for a top-level shake-up as the unrest continues. The public protests stem from the country's worst economic crisis in its history and long-simmering feuds between ethnic groups. Communist leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse tensions between the mostly Christian Slav minority and the largely Moslem ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority in the southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province in the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The Presidium statement appealed for urgent changes in the country's political and economic system to help resolved the crisis over growing labor unrest, a 217 percent annual inflation and a $ 21 billion foreign debt.

 As Election Day nears, education remains at best a marginal issue in the 1988 campaign _ the stuff of political rhetoric and modest promises, but not a cutting-edge issue for either candidate. More attention has been paid to whether teachers should be compelled to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each school day than to what students learn after that patriotic ritual. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said repeatedly he wants to go down in history as `` the education president.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate tells voters wherever he goes that better schools are the key to a better future for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, too, avers that he wants to be `` the education president.'' The Democrat gets big cheers every time he promises, `` We're going to make teaching a valued and honored profession again.'' Whichever candidate wins on Nov. 8, educators are confident the education budget will be in safer hands under the next president than under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But they say neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who attended private schools as a youngster, nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who attended public schools, has done enough to dramatize the problems facing American schools or to spell out a convincing plan to improve performance. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching, said, `` We hear strong inspirational statements about how important education is, but the direction the ` education president' would take is still not clear.'' At the outset of the campaign, `` the candidates were stumbling all over themselves to say this was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most urgent obligation,'' said <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. `` It faded as a central issue.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berendzen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` I grade both on what I hear and what I do n't hear ... I'd give both a D-plus.'' <PERSON> Berendzen </PERSON> said 25 percent of American young people drop out of high school and 20 percent grow up in poverty, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is far back on international scholastic tests. `` If you take a sober look at the matter, you could say that the preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year 2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Berendzen </PERSON>. Despite the generalities, said <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, `` It is obvious both candidates are making the link between economic productivity and international competitiveness and the underserved, undereducated poor.'' However, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> scholar, said it is inevitable that education will slip to the back of the president's agenda `` Education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will actually keep, as apart from a campaign list,'' said <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>. `` The deficit, defense, international relations, economic problems, even health care, Social Security, transportation and housing all are higher on their priority list.'' Both candidates have outlined ways to help families cope with the soaring costs of college _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a tax-free savings bond plan, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a new loan program that students would repay through payroll deductions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose administration tried to cut $ 5 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year, actually has proposed bigger spending increases than his rival. Here are their major education proposals:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ $ 500 million for a `` merit schools'' program that would reward schools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students. Schools would get up to $ 100,000 each to spend as they saw fit. _ $ 50 million for matching grants to create more `` magnet'' schools that emphasize various academic subjects. _ Expanding from $ 12 million to $ 50 million a proposed Fund for Innovation and Reform of Schools and Teaching to give each state $ 1 million for an experimental district trying such concepts as parental choice, merit pay or year-round schools. _ Money for <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, the $ 1.2 billion pre-school program for disadvantaged children, would be `` sharply increased'' by an unspecified amount. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is committed to building Head Start `` to a level where all eligible 4-year-olds can attend classes.'' The Children's Defense Fund says the 453,000 children now in <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> are only 16 percent of those eligible. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has also promised to spend more on Chapter 1, a $ 4.6 billion remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible poor students. _ Tax-free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Savings Bonds for college tuition. This would eventually cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 200 million a year; the tax break would be phased out for families earning $ 60,000 to $ 80,000 or above.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ $ 250 million for a National Teaching Excellence Fund to provide college scholarships and forgive loans for those who become teachers, launch a new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, create state teacher retraining centers, recruit retirees to teach, and support a five-fold expansion of a $ 1.9 million <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> Fellowship program for talented teachers. _ $ 25 million for a `` <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>'' to support volunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read. _ A Student Tuition and Repayment System -LRB- STARS -RRB- allowing students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions in their working years. It would supplement, not replace, existing federal grants and loans, at least at the start. Students would get STARS loans from banks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officials have suggested a payback rate of one-eighth to one-quarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per $ 1,000 borrowed, meaning a tax of 2.5 to 5 percent for a $ 20,000 borrower. The rate stays the same for low - and high-income earners, but the loan is never paid off

 On June 14, 1985, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and five fellow <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers were flying back from a project in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, looking forward to seeing family and friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The next day, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, a bullet in his head, was pushed out of the plane and died on the tarmac of the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Witnesses at the trial of confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> have been giving a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court a gut-wrenching account of the slaying of the 23-year-old <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> man who hoped to make a career in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> but who became the only person killed in the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847. The court has not ruled on the facts of the case, but the witnesses and official accounts have made possible a reconstruction of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s last hours. Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 leaves <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, some passengers hear a commotion from the rear of the jetliner as two <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem gunmen run screaming down the aisle, brandishing a hand grenade and a chrome-plated pistol. `` Americans die, come to die!'' passenger <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> hears the gunmen shouting at the 145 passengers and eight crew members at about 10 a.m. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON>, stationed in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, wakes his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buddy, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, from a short nap. `` This should be interesting,'' <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> is dressed casually in a checkered shirt and slacks. He has traded in the long hair he sported at <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the close-cropped haircut more suited to underwater welding. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and his accomplice, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, quickly round up passports and single out the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. The military men are hustled up to the first-class section, where a language difficulty fueled <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s notion that <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and therefore the object of particular hate. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> is tied up with elastic baggage straps, and the first in a long series of beatings begins. Sometimes they are just a few feet from pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and the two other men in the cockpit. At one point, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> complains about his bonds and shouts, `` It's too tight, it's too tight!'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who records show has just turned 21, responds: `` Let the pig suffer.'' <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s shouts are heard throughout the jetliner as it approaches <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. One hijacker beats <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> with an armrest torn from a seat, the sharp metal screws still pointing out. When <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> collapses nearly unconscious, one of the hijackers jumps up and down on his ribs, leaving his chest a mass of black-and-blue marks. `` Marine, Marine!'' the tormentors scream, apparently recalling the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1983. They beat <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> again after authorities at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport delay refueling the airliner. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, barely able to walk, is helped back to the coach section. That's when he meets up again with <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an Australian teen-ager who chatted with <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> is crying. Several ribs are broken and one hand is completely numb as he sits next to the girl. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> helps <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> eat because he is unable to feed himself. The unmarried diver, barely able to talk, tells <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> he hopes that if anyone has to die he will be the one since his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buddies on the flight are all married. The plane heads to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> early that same Friday afternoon. After the four-hour flight, the hijackers savagely beat <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and leave him for dead during tense negotiations for more jet fuel. In the evening, the hijackers order the plane back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> is brought back to the front of the airplane and the beating resumes. The plane lands early the next morning: Saturday, June 15, 1985. When negotiations with the tower in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> erupt into a screaming match, one of the hijackers shouts, `` Get up! Get up!'' to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. His head leaves a huge red imprint of blood on the aircraft's side. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> are bound and blindfolded. Sometime after 2:30 a.m. in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the hijackers pull the curtain on the first-class section. The stunned passengers and crew hear one shot _ possibly more. When the bullet pierces his head behind the right ear and exits on the other side of his head, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> exhales so loudly the passengers and crew hear it above the whining of the jet engines. `` My God, they have shot someone,'' chief flight attendant <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> says. The hijackers toss <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, still moaning, out the passenger exit and down onto the runway where he lives for about 10 minutes. His body is taken to the morgue at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has denied pulling the trigger and said it was the work of his accomplice. But <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s supervisor, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, also stationed in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> gloated over the slaying. `` He was proud of it,'' <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> testified. `` He looked like the fox that got the chicken. He showed absolutely no remorse.''

<HEAD>Mexican President Keeps New Plane After Near Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said it is replacing the president's 22-year-old plane because the jet suffered a `` serious breakdown'' with President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> and six Cabinet members on board. The new jet is a $ 49 million <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757-225, which the government bought in February and then tried to unload because of strong public protest over the price tag. A statement released Friday night by <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s office said the incident with the old jet, a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, occurred Sept. 17 during takeoff at the <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> airport. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> had been there surveying damage to the resort caused by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 `` suffered a serious breakdown that put in danger the security of the President of the Republic and his companions, among whom were six Cabinet secretaries,'' the statement said. It did not provide additional details. `` It must be noted that the heads or representatives of the judicial and legislative powers frequently travel with the president, as do foreign guests and even chiefs of state or government from other countries,'' the statement said in explaining the decision to keep the new aircraft. According to the statement, the government had been trying to sell the new jet but did n't get any decent offers, despite promoting the sale in more than 60 countries.

 Five elementary school girls walking home from a party were killed when a speeding car careened off a utility pole and onto a sidewalk, authorities said. Police Chief Reed <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said today no alcohol was involved in the accident. He said the driver was a diabetic but authorities were uncertain whether that played a role in the crash. Police were investigating reports that he may have had a seizure. He said the car may have been out of control for 1,500 feet. `` We do know that the vehicle was traveling at a high rate of speed,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. `` This must have happened just incredibly fast for these kids not to get out of the way.'' He identified the five pedestrians killed as <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Watia </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeefry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylok </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokop </PERSON>, all 13. The girls were all from <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> or its outskirts. The car hit a tree after it struck the girls, police said. The driver, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, 17, and his sister, a passenger, were taken to <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> hospitals and underwent surgery this morning. Both were in critical condition today, authorities said. He is a distant relative of victim <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. The community is a rural village of 1,875 about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Because of the tragedy, the high school canceled today's football game, Principal Guy <PERSON> David </PERSON> said `` The entire community is in a state of shock,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said. `` This is going to be a real problem for the community to deal with. In a small community like this, everybody knows everybody.'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusniak </PERSON>, 70, who lives near the crash site, said he was eating supper when he heard the accident outside his home. `` Everything was laying out in the street. It's terrible,'' <PERSON> Rusniak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, the father of the driver, told WFRV-TV in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> that his son and daughter were returning to the high school to get their textbooks when the accident occurred. A bomb threat had been made at the school Friday and officials dismissed students early, authorities said. No explosives were found and children were permitted back into the school to pick up belongings.

<HEAD>Governing Party Blasts Opposition Officials For Joining Radical
Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing party sharply criticized opposition parties Saturday after secretaries of some opposition lawmakers helped radical students seize the office of a federal legislator. Prosecutor-general <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-nam </PERSON> ordered a probe of the clash, in which some opposition officials attacked police with broken ashtrays, flowerpots and fire extinguishers and shouted slogans. `` It is a clear case of blocking the execution of official duties by police. All opposition secretaries and officials found involved will be arrested and punished,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Twenty-three radical students were arrested for seizing the office of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho-yang </PERSON>, a former defense minister and now a ranking member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The incident occurred Thursday. The students were demanding the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and his wife for alleged corruption. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> left office in Feburary. The governing party ran huge advertisements in almost all daily newspapers on Saturday, condemning the attack as an open challenge to democratic development. The ads said the attackers were `` leftist radicals'' trying to overthrow the government. The three main opposition parties said the government was overreacting in an effort to take attention away from allegations of corruption during <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s rule. A parliamentary investigation is focusing on the allegations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> after winning presidential elections in December. Opposition officials charge that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is reluctant to divulge wrongdoing by his predecessor. The dispute appeared to end a short truce between the government and opposition parties during the Olympics, which ended Oct. 2.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, concluding a week of attacks on Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stands on crime, accepted the endorsement of the head of a national police group today, then said in answer to reporters' questions that he has not been trying to distance himself from running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was getting `` a little tired of erroneous reporting out there'' that has noted his relative lack of comment on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> since Wednesday night's vice presidential debate, which polls show most people thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> lost to Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` This concept that I see in some of these reports that I am not supportive of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are absolutely ludicrous,'' he said. `` They are ridiculous. He did well in that debate. He has my full support ... and I made a good decision'' in selecting the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after accepting the endorsement of <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. A news release from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign emphasized the 197,000-person membership of the organization, but <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> acknowledged he was only giving his personal support, not that of the group, which has not taken a position on the race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, was heading for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> today, after a speech Friday in which he stood in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> auto parts plant owned by Italians and attacked foreign ownership of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, said today in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> he would n't let the Republicans concentrate only on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and keep the spotlight off <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> running mate whom <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> debated Wednesday night. He said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> had made a mistake in choosing `` a candidate that the imagemakers and the poll takers thought could be packaged and sold to the American people.'' As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech Friday, campaign aides, moving quickly to say that he was not criticizing any company in particular, acknowledged that he did n't know the <ORGANIZATION> Moog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant in suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> had foreign owners. `` If anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just remind them of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he's happy that foriegn owners are buying up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to foreign owners _ but that's not the kind of future <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I and -LRB- Missouri Rep. -RRB- <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> want for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he continued. The <PERSON> Moog </PERSON> family sold the company more than 10 years ago to <ORGANIZATION> IFINT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the American subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> IFI </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IFI </ORGANIZATION> is owned by the <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> family, which also owns the automaker <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later said of the incident, `` It was not a faux pas.'' The candidates made their rounds as sponsors of next week's second and final presidential debate said the event would be held Thursday or Friday night on the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> beginning at 9 p.m. EDT The 90-minute encounter will be televised nationally. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has made <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' former prison furlough program the centerpiece of his soft-on-crime attack against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has been criticized by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp for making such charges when he is vice president of the federal government which also has a furlough program. `` There's no question that the federal furlough program should be reviewed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> told reporters on Friday. `` We talked about it today. ... <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have his attorney general do that.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the Repbulican candidate had no specific proposal to revise the current law and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was satisfied it is `` fundamentally different'' from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law that granted a weekend furlough in 1986 to convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. In a campaign speech Friday in <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` relented'' and repealed the law that let murderers go on weekend furlough `` under the bright spotlight of the national presidential campaign.'' In some of the harshest language he has used to describe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused his rival of having compassion for criminals but `` an astounding lack of sensitivity'' for crime victims. With one month to go to the election, the polls continued to show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a step ahead in the race for the White House. Democrats were hoping that other polls rating <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as the winner of the vice presidential debate would serve as prelude to a shift in the presidential race itself. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> laughed at that, as he shrugged off Democratic campaign commercials aimed at raising doubts about his fitness for high office. `` We can stand the heat. We're going to stay in the kitchen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The voters will vote for him,'' the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> chipped in on the Democratic anti-Quayle barrage, saying it was an `` incredible misfit'' for his vice presidential rival to compare his own experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s before the 1960 election. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s self-comparison produced the most riveting moment of the debate, when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> turned to him and said, `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today denounced as `` absolutely ludicrous'' any notion that he is trying to keep his distance from running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He's doing just fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in answer to a question from reporters after he accepted the endorsement of a law enforcement official. `` I support him very strongly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added with apparent anger in his voice, `` This concept that I see in some of these reports that I am not supportive of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are absolutely ludicrous.'' `` They are ridiculous,'' he said. `` He did well in that debate. He has my full support ... and I made a good decision'' in selecting the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he gets `` a little tired of erroneous reporting out there.'' He was endorsed today by <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, who called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` the law enforcement candidate.'' However, while a news release from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign touted the 197,000-person membership of <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' organization, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> acknowledged that he was only giving his personal support, not that of the organization, which has not taken a position. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' former prison furlough program the centerpiece of his soft-on-crime attack against presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but a top aide said Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes the federal prison furlough program should be reviewed as well. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides have criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the subject while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is vice president of a federal system that also has a furlough program. `` There's no question that the federal furlough program should be reviewed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, told reporters on Friday. `` We talked about it today ... <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have his attorney general do that.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate had no specific proposal to revise the current law, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was satisfied it is `` fundamentally different'' from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law that granted a weekend furlough in 1986 to convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. Questions about the federal furlough program arose as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped up his attack against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the furlough program in the Democratic governor's home state. In a campaign speech Friday in <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as governor `` relented'' and repealed the law that let murderers go on weekend furlough `` under the bright spotlight of the national presidential campaign'' this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` the furlough king'' later at an outdoor rally of several thousand pople in <LOCATION> Medina </LOCATION>, an affluent white suburb of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He continued the tough-on-crime talk at a later rally at <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Summit High School in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has always espoused liberal views. `` What I fault him for is trying to now be something he is not,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the packed high school gym. Reporters were denied access to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as has been the case since last week, but the campaign put out an information sheet when asked what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had to say on the federal government's own furlough program. It said the federal furloughs are granted only within two years of a prisoner's release date. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program was more lenient, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, citing the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case in which <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> bludgeoned a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple, raping the woman, after escaping during a weekend furlough. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> could not have been furloughed under the federal program, which is available only to prisoners in `` community custody,'' the lowest security level in the federal prison system. In some of the harshest language he has used to describe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alleged Friday that his rival has compassion for criminals but `` an astounding lack of sensitivity'' for crime victims. `` He still clings to a discredited liberal ideology that blinds him to the true causes of crime, and the often devastating effects it has on innocent people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION> speech to law enforcement officials and supporters. `` I'm not faulting the governor of Maassachusetts for one error in judgment. But it concerns me deeply that in all this time, as far as I know, the governor has never acknowledged that his furlough program was a mistake,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` On no other issue is my opponent's philosophy so completely at odds with mine, and I would say, with the common sense attitudes of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, than on the issue of crime,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Another crime-oriented speech is set for Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, campaign aides said.

<TEXT>
 The leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday opposed deploying <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops to supervise deadlocked presidential elections. The proposal is backed by a rival <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are practical procedural difficulties at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in assigning <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces internal missions like supervision of security for the presidential election session,'' Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> told reporters before leaving for talks in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital. He planned to discuss the presidential election with officials there. `` The reasons behind the failure to elect a president have not been related to security issues so far, but to the lack of consensus on the president's identity and his political line,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s government splintered into rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> factions after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new president when <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired Sept. 22. A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> proposal to deploy <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to oversee the election was endorsed by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian militia commander, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, on Thursday. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, who opposes <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, backs the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> headed by the army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as in the Moslem western and southern sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new president due to a lack of quorum following a boycott by Christian deputies. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, acting minutes before the expiration of his term, appointed Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, to head a six-man interim Cabinet. Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist leaders have rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s cabinet, continuing to recognize <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' five-man body that ruled during <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term

<HEAD>How Congress Rewrote Washington's Laws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> dreamed of becoming the nation's 51st state. But as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> winds down almost two years later, the dream has ended and the nation's capital is hoping to hold on to whatever limited self-governance it has. Somehow, the district became entangled in four touchy issues _ abortion rights, life insurance for AIDS victims, homosexual rights and a residency requirement for city workers. In all four, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has told the city to change its laws or lose the money the federal government provides as a payment for the cost incurred in being the seat of the federal government. Those actions stunned city officials, especially <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the local clergyman who serves as the district's non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives He accused colleagues of exerting `` raw, naked power'' over the city. `` It is unfair to single out the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and tell them how to spend local funds,'' fumes <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>. `` That violates the letter and spirit of home rule.'' Adds <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, the city's chief lobbyist to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` By taking these actions, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has in effect created the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. The floodgates have been opened. After this, what next?'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> had bragged he would force a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor on the statehood issue by last July 4. He was wrong, and he now concedes the issue may not even come up for a vote in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which begins its two-year run in January. Under the limited home rule law enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves the city's budget. Home rule gave the city's 670,000 residents the right to elect a mayor and city council, but left them without a vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and provided a congressional veto of laws enacted by the city council <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has exercised the veto only twice before. This year's city budget is $ 3.2 billion, including $ 539 million in federal money, which is supposed to be a payment in lieu of taxes on real estate owned by the federal government and foreign governments. On the demand of conservatives, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> attached amendments to the appropriations bill and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed them into law last weekend. One provides that the city could n't pay for any abortions except to save the life of the mother. In the past eight years, the district government paid for 32,725 abortions. Another amendent demanded that the city repeal a law requiring insurance companies to sell life insurance to people with AIDS. A third insisted the city revamp its human rights code under which <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has been required to grant rights to gay student groups. A fourth told the city to soften its law requiring most city employees to live within the district's boundaries. `` The city just happened to be a victim'' on the issues of abortion and gay rights, said Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who sided with the city on those questions. `` The city became a battleground for two larger social issues. It just happened to be there at the wrong time.'' Meanwhile, the statehood quest, championed by <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, has bogged down over questions about whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would still pay the city in exchange for lost tax revenues. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans would be sure to oppose statehood out of recognition that the heavily-Democratic state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> almost certainly would be represented by two Democratic senators. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> approval of statehood would only be the first step. A constitutional amendment would have to be approved by three-quarters of the states before it could take effect. In the past, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has threatened to veto the district's spending package if it did not include abortion language similar to the restriction proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION> However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was prevented from doing so because the city budget was often lumped with several other appropriation measures into a single bill. Vetoing it would have denied federal agencies of funds. <PERSON> Fauntry </PERSON> said adoption this time of a separate bill dealing with <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> spending left the city vulnerable to pro-life and anti-gay forces in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> has threatened to encourage city officials to disobey the congressional orders, and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> has called for citizens of the nation's capital to take to the streets in protest, Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> surprised many Washingtonians by remaining aloof. `` This vote is not a direct attack on home rule,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` After all, they did approve every penny of our appropriations bill. The district bill was just used as a vehicle by special interest groups on election-year issues.'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said he is considering filing lawsuits and initiating non-violent protests to challenge the congressional action. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said his sworn oath to uphold the constitution would prevent him from restricting abortion funding or changing the Human Rights Code.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The euphoria that greeted the soldiers' rebellion in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> is giving way to skepticism of new President Prosper <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> and his apparent view that the nation is not ready for democracy. `` We were encouraged by the coup d'etat; we were optimistic after our conversation with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> and Sgt. -LRB- <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>; now we are disappointed,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who met with the two last week. <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> and other political and labor leaders give <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> high marks for his actions in the three weeks since <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON> and other enlisted men of the Presidential Guard deposed Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and placed <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> in the presidency. But concern is growing over <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s close ties to the dictatorships that preceded him and a reported reluctance to call elections. <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> referred to a story in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>, which quoted <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as saying Haitians are too poor for immediate democracy. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has told some visitors elections probably wo n't be held for 2 years. On Wednesday, a popular priest said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> could not be trusted until he eliminates the dreaded Tonton Macoutes, the private army that operated under dictators <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. Members of the Tonton Macoutes have been blamed for the Sept. 11 killing of 13 parishoners and wounding of more than 70 at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people do not trust you; -LRB- the people -RRB- should consider all big-shot Duvalierists as big time criminals until they prove the contrary for the rest of their lives,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> said in remarks directed to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> in a radio speech. The young priest is considered one of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most popular figures among the poor. <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> must declare his government short-term and provisional and reinstate the suspended 1987 constitution. <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> also must arrest and try the thugs responsible for the church slayings and for the deaths of 34 voters during the aborted presidential election in November. He called <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s statement that Haitians are not ready for democracy an insult to the people and proof that he `` has not yet divorced himself from Duvalierism.'' `` We are not impatient. Two and a half years have gone by since the fall of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime. We are overpatient,'' said <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> was ruled for 29 years by <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and then his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, who fled the country in February 1986 after widespread unrest. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led a junta until February, when civilian President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was sworn in. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in June. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> is a close friend of the younger <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and became a millionaire as <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s financial adviser. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s future authority is linked to bringing about democracy in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` Whatever <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> might personally desire, he participates in and is controlled by a situation he did not make himself,'' <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> said Tuesday, one day after meeting with <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heubreau </PERSON>. The soldiers sent <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> into exile in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and forced <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, ousted mayor of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> and an alleged leader of the Macoutes, to seek political asylum in the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> also retired Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, former commander of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion. On Sept. 30, soldiers arrested about 30 alleged Macoutes linked to the church massacre. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who has been indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, was considered the commander most likely to lead any resistance to the rebellion. He is reported under house arrest. <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said he had gone to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeking support for a provisional government until elections are held. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has withheld aid to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` They still see <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as involved with Duvalierism,'' <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said. `` Avril's tarnished image improved after the coup d'etat, but not enough to shine.''

 The son of Admiral <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, the polar explorer, has been found dead of malnutrition and dehydration in a warehouse three weeks after he disappeared from a Washington-bound train, officials said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 68, left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sept. 13 to attend a ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> honoring his father with a new stamp. He never arrived and his whereabouts remained a mystery for three weeks. `` I put him on a train and my wife was supposed to meet him,'' his son, <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, told The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun in a story published Saturday. `` What happened in between, I do n't know It's very strange, this whole thing. We're trying to come to grips with it.'' `` He idolized his father. The main focus of his life was to continue what my grandfather had started, to help people who wanted information about him,'' said <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s four sons. Relatives said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> dreamed of establishing a museum in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to the admiral, who in 1926 was one of the first men to fly over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> and who three years later led an expedition to the South Pole. `` He had all my grandfather's papers, all the manuscripts,'' along with Eskimo boots and coats worn by the explorers, <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had joined his father on an expedition to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> in the 1940s, <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said his father had suffered from some memory loss, but had n't wandered before. Police said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s body was found Monday in a debris-strewn warehouse, clad in workman's clothes and one shoe, although he had left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in a tan shirt and brown pants. The custodian who found his body recalled running him off the property a few days earlier and believed him to be a drifter. Police identified <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> through a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> identification card pinned to his undershorts. <PERSON> Leverett </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said his father, who lived off small trust funds and stock market investments, had a hard time being the son of a famous figure. `` His whole life was pretty difficult.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is trying hard to beat the rap that his experience as a governor has not equipped him to handle national defense and foreign policy. He has talked tough on military spending and driven an M-1 tank; met with foreign leaders from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, and he has extolled the virtues of governors who became president. Or three of them, anyway. `` Some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders, were governors: <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in the first presidential debate. He did not mention the last two presidents, both of them former governers whose foreign policy performances have brought mixed reviews. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a two-term <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor, is regularly lambasted by critics who say he is unfamiliar with the nitty gritty of national security. He is faulted for such acts as the 1983 invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and the 1986 bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and for moving slowly on arms control. His record as president will be tainted by the Iran-Contra affair, as well. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who was governor of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, is blamed by conservatives for reacting poorly to revolutions in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and for allowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence abroad to deteriorate. If elected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be the third man in a row to move from the state house to the White House without having held a senior federal job. Only one other former governor, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, has become president in this century without previously holding top elected or appointed federal office. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, lauded by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> during World War I before he served as governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> held identical posts at the turn of the century before becoming vice president and then president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't have those entries on his resume, but like others before him, he is trying to `` create a lot of ersatz credentials'' in foreign policy, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, who was an aide to former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` They go on trade missions. They join the Council on Foreign Relations or the <ORGANIZATION> Trilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is what <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, now a scholar at the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Or they ride tanks and meet with foreign leaders. Governors who are elected president `` rely on a brain trust. But so does everybody else, too, as the field becomes more specialized,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` Even <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who was truly engaged in foreign policy and made it his life interest, brought in specialists,'' notably <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who served as his national security adviser. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> foreign policy adviser, says the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's `` style as a leader and governor is quite different from either <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ideas `` come out of interaction with other folks. There is a combination of progressive values and pragmatism that is something special. It is not classic liberalism,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s view of the world was shaped by his career as a submarine officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and his devotion to his Baptist faith. He appointed a strong-minded national security adviser, <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of Soviet affairs, born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and deeply suspicious of the Kremlin. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appointed a very different personality as his secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, a Wall Street lawyer and veteran of senior government appointments who was deeply committed to diplomacy and negotiations. `` There were two world-views spinning around'' at the top level of government, said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, and the result was a sometimes confused and vacillating approach to foreign affairs that ultimately brought <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was very interested in detail. He had difficulty keeping his mind focused on the big picture, and was unable to resist an overly expansive agenda.'' `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is very effective at projecting a few central themes but does not involve himself directly in the issues, neither in the broad shape of the issues or in the details. But he has kept in mind a few simple things and knows what a manageable agenda is,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, who is dean of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> once taught and where he turns for much of his foreign policy advice. Conflicting views of the world at the top of the administration `` were not <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s problem,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` He had a distinct point of view that the people who were working for him had no trouble following.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> survived several overseas debacles, including the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> barracks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1983, but his hands-off management style contributed to the worst policy crisis of his administration, the exchange of arms for hostages with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Clearly `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had trouble with national security advisers,'' running through six in seven years, said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not said publicly who he might appoint national security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected. But among those often mentioned for those two important posts are <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> and two colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnesdale </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, a Czechoslovakian-born <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who served in the Carter White House.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, contending the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have `` had it'' with drug users and pushers, today exhorted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to approve tough, House-passed anti-drug legislation before adjourning next week. `` Time is fast running out,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address, delivered from his weekend retreat at Camp David, Md. `` I want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by a long shot, but we are doing better and our nation is united against this scourge as never before,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The House has passed one version of the legislation, but the measure has not yet come before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill has many good and tough provisions that express our national commitment to five simple but powerful words _ those words are ` zero tolerance' and ` Just say no,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, lifting the slogan from his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s anti-drug education campaign. `` By zero tolerance, we mean simply, that we've had it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. `` All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pointed out that the bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month on a 375-30 vote includes the death penalty for those who kill a law enforcement officer or authorizes the killing of anyone in a drug-related crime. `` We must, we need and we will have this law,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also put in a plug for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate his `` point man'' on the administration's anti-drug fight. Senators have been negotiating privately over crucial time-limiting agreements that would enable <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass the anti-drug measure before adjournment, expected to come at the end of next week. A bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the drug measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. But they agreed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will run out of time if long debates ensue over controversial issues such as user penalties and allowing the admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in `` good faith.''

 The setting sun was glaring into camera lenses, it was late in the afternoon, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was doing the main `` visual'' of his campaign day, helping to destroy confiscated drugs at an incinerator in suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. But few Americans would ever see it. The event was too late to make it onto the evening TV news, the low angle of the sun made photographs difficult if not impossible, and even those at the site _ squinting to see _ could not make out exactly what it was that the Democratic presidential nominee was doing. That same day, rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the scene for the majestic landing of the space shuttle Discovery. The two events, and the way that campaign strategists set up their respective candidate's participation in them, helps dramatize the differences between the two campaigns _ although, to be sure, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is able to capitalize on events he can attend like the Discovery landing by virtue of his current office. While the vice president's campaign is by most accounts slick and polished, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign remains, according to critics, uneven and sometimes amateurish. Some observers suggest that the number of seasoned veterans in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, beginning at the top with former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a veteran of three past presidential campaigns, is a prime reason for the skill and quick reaction time often shown by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s guiding hand on the campaign of his longtime friend is also widely viewed as a main reason why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has emerged since the GOP convention in August as more aggressive and less frantic than he appeared before. However, observers also suggest that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' high command is improving on logistics and strategy, particularly with the re-appearance of veteran <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> on Labor Day as the campaign's chief strategist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, who worked in the presidential campaigns of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1980, remains <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is an outsider whose team was largely composed of veterans of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics. And he's been slower to integrate the professionals,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` an insider, who pulled in inside people around him.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign over the past few weeks: _ Twice raided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state to pick up the endorsements of police organizations, part of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s effort to portray his rival as soft on crime. _ Moved quickly, after the first nationally televised presidential debate, to say that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not want to make women who seek abortions guilty of criminal activity, even after he had left the issue vague. _ Has made the most of staged visual events to get on the evening news, sticking to one message each day and reinforcing it with photogenic campaign events. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't just show up at campaign events. He makes entrances. Bands play, thousands of balloons go up. At a rally in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived on a brightly decorated riverboat. And traveling across <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> by bus, he brought his own warm-up group with him: country singers <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign team is several layers deep. His main campaign staff includes such professionals as campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, an official in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 and 1984 campaigns; pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, who has worked on every presidential race for the past two decades, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, who was chief media consultant for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1972 and for a host of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates since. The first team is augmented by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultants who do n't draw a regular salary but whose expertise is routinely called on _ and who have narrow, specific assignments. For instance, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who has worked two past presidential campaigns, is currently focusing just on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant, has one job with the campaign: studying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' daily campaign techniques and reporting back on which ones seem to be working. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national political director, was assigned to keep an eye on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, then over the past few days was reassigned to travel with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to oversee a program of damage control after the vice presidential debate. He joins another political veteran, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, who was assigned full-time to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at the GOP convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself seldom gets involved with day-to-day strategy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does. Asked whether he had seen his recent campaign ads attacking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` Are you kidding? Nothing goes on around here without me knowing.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' circle of top-level advisers has been changing _ in part in reaction to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> critics who said the campaign had not brought in experienced party leaders. For instance, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on recent campaign trips has been accompanied by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, a former speechwriter to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Also, traveling with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days have been <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers and longtime <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> political consultants <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON>, veteran of Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s presidential bid, has been brought in to bolster the speechwriting staff. Campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> travels nearly everywhere with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He is a respected <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> corporate lawyer and a long-time friend of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. His last national campaign experience was with <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a veteran campaign aide and occasional movie producer, has taken on a more visible role since the return of <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> now travels with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and is trying to coordinate the political message with what appears on television. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a former aide to then-House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, was brought in last spring and given a large role in shaping the political message. The campaign has also brought in a few aides from other Democratic campaigns. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, political director for the <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign, is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Southern coordinator. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who was with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, is an occasional adviser. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazille </PERSON>, from the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign, sometimes travels with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donilon </PERSON>, a top official with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign, helped coordinate debate preparation. Still, few of these individuals have extensive experience in presidential campaigns. `` I think the Democrats have been behind on that for some time, even though they're beginning to catch up,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, former campaign manager for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his people used the period from the spring to the convention very well to bring in the best talent in their party. And they made a much faster transition from the primary to the general election than did the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign,'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Yale Acquires Docuemnts Of Powerful Italian Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A huge archive of long-secret documents of a family powerful in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during the Renaissance has been acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and may give scholars a better understanding of 15th - and 16th-century <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> The <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON> family were bankers and businessmen who held important offices in the Florentine state. Family members also were generals in wars between Italian city-states, treasurers to popes, spies and ambassadors. The family's activities spanned four centuries. The family even had business offices in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday that it obtained the collection in April through a Swiss rare books dealer. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Littell </PERSON> said he did n't know how much <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> paid for it and said no further information would be made available about the deal. The collection obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library comprises more than 150,000 detailed records and chronicles that have never been studied by scholars and are virtually unknown to historians, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> said. The documents are `` among the most significant of any known Italian archive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Benno </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beinecke </PERSON> director, said the collection includes records of banking activities, international trade and finance, family life, marriage, slavery, inheritance, private wealth and patronage of charitable organizations The records also include detailed information about the business concerns of other families, including the Medicis and <ORGANIZATION> Borgias </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do not think history books on the period will be written again without mentioning the <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON>'s relationships with the Medici are well documented and the families even intermarried, but the <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON> represent a completely different faction of Florentine politics,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>, the library's <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beinecke </PERSON> Curator of Early Books and Manuscipts. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> officials said the most significant document found in the collection is a 1440 record by <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON>, treasurer for several popes in the 15th century. It is his record of tax payments to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> by every diocese and abbey in the world, and codifies the financial state of the church under <PERSON> Eugenius </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, who was pope from 1431-1447. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> said it could take as long as four years to complete cataloging the documents. Some of them might be made available to scholars as early as January, and an exhibition of some of the documents will open at the university in May.

 Amid tears and grief, thousands of people who have died of AIDS were memorialized Saturday in ceremonies centered on a huge quilt made by friends and family members of the victims. `` One of the most important things we get here today is the strength and sense of community we can feel, and the knowledge that this terrible disease affects everyone,'' said <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, director of the Names Project. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 34, is the founder of the San Francisco-based commemorative project, which involved making a huge fabric quilt that was spread out on the Ellipse, south of the White House. The quilt, five times larger than when it was displayed here last year, contains 8,288 handmade panels, each in memory of a single person or group of people who have died of AIDS since 1981. Each of the panels measures three feet by six feet and all 50 states and a dozen foreign countries are represented. The panels are made from a variety of fabrics and many are elaborately decorated. The 375,000-square-foot quilt is bisected by walkways. While hundreds of people walked among the panels on the sunny, chilly morning, volunteers read the names of thousands of AIDS victims. One of the 495 volunteer readers was scheduled to be <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of the Democratic presidential candidate. But her appearance was canceled because her flight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later Saturday was delayed. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> began the Names Project in 1986 after a friend died of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Since then, it has blossomed into a nationwide project and the quilt has been on a 20-city tour in the past 18 months. The quilt includes the names of about one-fifth of the approximately 42,000 Americans known to have died of AIDS since 1981. `` It's a very beautiful thing, but it's built on corpses,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We've learned from the quilt that country is filled with good, kind, decent people who understand how to respond, who understand that this is affecting all people, regardless of their race, background of sexuality.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said panels are still being accepted, although he said organizers have n't decided how many more panels to add to the quilt. More than 10,000 have been made, and panels not added to the quilt were on display around the city in smaller quilts. One of the visitors was <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Her 23-year-old son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, died last Christmas Eve. With tears in her eyes, she wrote on a blank panel of the quilt: `` I pray that mothers and fathers will love and stand by their sons and daughters even when they do n't understand or accept their lifestyle.'' She signed it: `` A mother who's glad she did.'' Two of the readers were <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, whose 31-year-old son died last year. `` We're doing this in memory of our son _ to help others,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said tearfully, noting the quilt would help parents `` relieve their grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed away.'' Others, like <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> simply wept. `` I knew all of these people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said between sobs. `` They were my contemporaries. I'm not 40 yet and all I talk about now is death _ my grandmother talks about death _ it's not right.''

<HEAD>Politburo Discusses Budget Cut, Making Ruble Convertible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling Politburo is considering cutting the national budget and discussed making the ruble a convertible currency, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The newspaper said the subjects were discussed Thursday during a session on the 1989 budget. Pravda said the 12-man Politburo discussed `` steps to make the ruble a convertible currency.'' It did not explain further. Some Soviet economists have argued for making the ruble convertible, so it could be transferred into other currencies on the world market. This would remove a major stumbling block to trade, but it would likely cause runaway inflation because the ruble's value would drop. The newspaper also did not give any details on the plans to cut the budget, which is reportedly running at a deficit of more than $ 100 billion. It said only that there were plans to `` reduce expenses in all areas of the economy.'' The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> reported last month that the country is running a budget deficit of at least 73 billion rubles, or $ 116 billion. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit is $ 150 billion. The Soviet deficit amounts to about 15 percent of the budget, which is about $ 773 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said. It blamed the deficit on the cost of cleaning up the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant disaster, lower income to the state from slashed vodka sales, and the falling price of oil. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the world's biggest oil exporter. Pravda said that while the Politburo wants to reduce expenses, it also decided to improve the supply of food and consumer goods. There were no details. Consumers surrounded Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on visit last month to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and complained that his plans for perestroika, or restructuring of the economy and society, have not solved chronic shortages of food and housing. The Politburo reviews the budget, which is then rubber stamped by the Supreme Soviet, or legislature. The Supreme Soviet is scheduled to take up the budget in a session later this month.

 Two Coast Guardsmen braved six-foot waves and near-gale-force wind to swim out to rescue six people whose sailboat had been driven onto rocks during stormy weather, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` That boat was really taking a pounding in the surf,'' said Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. `` We knew we had to take the people off right then, and the only way to get to them was to send rescue swimmers to them through the surf.''

A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> petty officer who happened to look out the window of the Point <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> station saw the boat on the rocks, amid waves that were topping six feet, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said.

 Three years ago, with appropriate hoopla, the space shuttle Enterprise was carried piggy-back on an airliner to <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to await the building of a museum that would become its permanent home. There is no museum yet and, according to Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., there wo n't be one for at least five years `` I would like to propose a solution to this problem,'' he wrote <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwitt </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum, last week. `` It seems to me that there is an ideal alternative to keeping the Enterprise in storage for the next five years; an alternative that would make it available to many millions of people at this importrant time in the history of our civil space program.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s solution: Take the Enterprise back to whence it came _ the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which happens to be in <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s congressional district. The Enterprise never flew in space and never shuttled. It was a lame duck from the day it was manufactured. It was used in `` drop tests'' to see how an orbiter would land unpowered, and in `` fit tests'' to see how well it fit on its launch pad. It was flown around the world on the back of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, and around this country where huge crowds gazed skyward at the unusual sight. Before being flown to <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION>, just outside of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the Enterprise had been an exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center. The cost of packing and unpacking the shuttle for that trip was $ 1.2 million. `` Each year more than 2.5 million tourists visit the Kennedy Space Center,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> wrote. `` Over a 5-year period, more than 12 million people would have an opportunity to view this important symbol of American prowess in space. This would seem to be of much greater value than simply keeping the Enterprise in storage.'' The shuttle is too big to be housed in the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s Air and Space Museum and the special building was to have been constructed at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION>. There was no immediate reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>.

 The biggest show of Michelangelo drawings ever exhibited in this country will give <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> a unique chance to judge a major argument among art-lovers: did he design a round dome for St. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, or the taller dome St. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s now has, like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol? Originally the Capitol, built and rebuilt three centuries after <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s, had a round dome. The exhibit called `` Michelangelo: Draftsman @ Architect'' opens Sunday at the National Gallery of Art. One of the people who put it all together was <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millon </PERSON>, dean of the museum's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> in the Visual Arts. He wrote in the catalogue that never, before this exhibition, has so much of the evidence on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s dome been brought together. `` If you are an Anglo-American scholar or a German scholar, you believe that <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> in the period 1558-61 built the model that he intended -LRB- for -RRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s ..., a model with a hemispherical inner and outer dome,'' he told a news conference. `` If you are -LRB- an -RRB- Italian or French -LRB- scholar -RRB- you believe that after the model was finished in 1561 he changed his mind and decided to elevate the outer dome, to the profile that it has today.'' The wooden model itself, 16.5 feet high and made under <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s direction, is part of the exhibit. It has the same elongated dome seen on the cathedral today. But some scholars believe the shape of both the model, and the actual dome, was changed on the orders of <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Porta </PERSON>, who finished the dome after <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s death. Also on show is a pen-and-ink drawing attributed to a Frenchman, <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Duperac </PERSON>, from the period between <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s death and the completion of the dome. It says: `` This building, following the design of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Michelangelo </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Buonarotti </PERSON>, will be finished in this manner ...'' It depicts a round dome, not an elongated one. Another feature of the show is a newly-identified <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> drawing of the suicide of <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>, never shown publicly before. Among the unusual pieces is a drawing in black chalk of the torture of <LOCATION> Tityus </LOCATION>, a figure in Greek mythology who was punished by having an enormous bird tear at his vitals. <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> held the drawing up to the light, traced it on the other side of the paper, elimninated the bird, added a Roman soldier and presented the result as a resurrected Christ. The show will be open in the gallery's West Building until Dec. 11. After that, the part of the show that consists mainly of figure drawings will go to the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, dogged by questions about his embattled running mate, fought to keep the spotlight on his tough-on-crime message Saturday by collecting another law-enforcement endorsement. After the event, he said it was `` absolutely ludicrous'' to suggest his support of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has lagged since Wednesday night's vice presidential debate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest in a series of endorsement announcements came from <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, president of the national <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, who called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` the law enforcement candidate.'' While a fact sheet released by the campaign highlighted <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' role as head of the 197,000-member organization, stating it is the largest law-enforcement group in the country, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> acknowledged that his endorsement was a personal one, not representing the organization He said the group as a body would not make an endorsement before the election. At the brief announcement outside <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> acknowledged in response to reporters' questions that they differ on at least one law-enforcement issue: a waiting period to purchase a gun. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' group favors a federal law requiring a seven-day waiting period so that a purchaser's record can be checked before he can buy a gun. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the waiting period is `` a common sense approach.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't favor a federal waiting period. I do favor the states having the right to do that.'' Noting that he differs with <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, he said, `` We do n't agree on every single issue but that is my position.'' The vice president, at first bypassing further questions as he has for the past 10 days, turned to go back into his house. But when someone shouted a question about how <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was doing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned and said heatedly: `` He's doing just fine. Just fine and I support him strongly. Let me say something about that. This concept that I see in some of these reports that I am not supportive of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are absolutely ludicrous. They are ridiculous.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s references to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have diminished since his running mate's debate Wednesday night with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was `` erroneous reporting'' to suggest there is any meaning to that. `` He did well in that debate. He has my full support and he is getting strong support since the debate. ... I made a good decision and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people saw it in that debate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has intensified his criticism of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> since the debate, frequently belittling him in campaign speeches. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also has a new TV ad focusing on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to hammer <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, with another anti-crime speech slated for Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.

 September to 5.4 percent for all civilian workers and 5.3 percent when you include the military. But behind these numbers is more good news _ 255,000 got new jobs last month in the non-farm sector, which means that since the recovery began in 1982, over 18 million new jobs have been created. There's nothing more pleasing than watching <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> move forward with purpose and the news reminds us yet again that this great nation is, as Senator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, the envy of the world. Now, I'd like to turn to another subject, the war on drugs. I want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by a long shot, but we're doing better and our nation is united against this scourge as never before. Right now there is a drug bill on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. It has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but has n't even come up for consideration in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and time is fast running out. The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express our national commitment to five simple, but powerful, words. Those words are `` zero tolerance'' and `` Just say no.'' When we say zero tolerance, we mean simply that we've had it. We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay. We believe that when those who sell drugs are caught, they must make redress for the damage they cause. That's why the administration, personified by the leadership and passion of this administration's point man on drugs, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the national voice of conscience, my wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, has advocated tougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners and the drug dealers. We are doing this by seizing the ill-gotten possessions of drug dealers and their accomplices. Those fancy cars and fancy houses and bank accounts full of dirty money are n't really theirs. They were bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants. We do not tolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers, and we wo n't let people who are poisoning the blood of our children get away with it either Those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing to peddle their toxins must get the message as well. We will not tolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the same quarters where disadvantaged Americans struggle to build a better life. We want to kick the vermin out and keep them out. Nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legal challenges when we do arrest them, and we must work to see them jailed. And that's why we're advocating a change in the law that will allow exceptions in the so-called `` exclusionary rule'' to permit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by the police. Nor can our vigilance cease once they're behind bars. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed, and I support, drug testing for all who seek early release from jail, to send them this message, `` You do n't go free until you're drug free.'' We wo n't have a drug-free society until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to our shores. We must protect our coasts, and that means using the resources and calling on the noble men and women of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to protect us. We've sought increases in the drug enforcement budget, but in the past we've encountered consistent resistance from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I requested $ 538 million for the Drug Enforcement Adminstration in fiscal 1989, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hacked $ 33 million away. I think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kind of political behavior, and I imagine you agree with me. But there is a way more vital than all of these, that we can express our revulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drug peddler. These people seem to feel nothing, no fear, no remorse, nothing, when they pull out a machine gun and murder a police officer in the line of duty. The bill that has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provides for the death penalty for these vicious killers. We must, we need, and we will have this law. Now, there are those who've opposed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill because it includes the death penalty. Others oppose it because of the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. I believe these people are more concerned with the abstract rights of criminals than the right of our society to save itself from those, in this country and outside, who seek their fortune in our national misfortune. I challenge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to get that bill passed. The nation demands it and there's no time to waste. Compromises on the key provisions are unacceptable. We must let the drug kingpins know your days are numbered. Our cause is just, and we will triumph. Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

<HEAD>`Red Tide' Brings Shellfish Ban To Puget Sound</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Part of Puget Sound has been closed to shellfishing because of shellfish poisoning, or `` red tide'', and shellfish from the area are being pulled from store shelves in eight states, officials said. While northern beaches along Puget Sound are routinely closed due to red tide, this is the first time southern beaches have been closed because of contaminated shellfish, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Plews </PERSON>, shellfish supervisor for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the first time -LRB- paralytic shellfish poisoning -RRB- has been found south of the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> -LRB- Narrows -RRB- Bridge at such high levels,'' he said. Officials said testing was intensified after a 57-year-old Port Orchard woman was treated for the illness after eating contaminated oysters from the area a week ago. Shellfish poisoning is caused by an invisible, odorless and tasteless organism that grows naturally in shellfish tissue and multiplies rapidly in warmer water. It does not threaten dother sea life, but it can sicken and even kill people who eat elevated levels of the toxin. It is called red tide because of the reddish discoloration of sea water caused by the organism. State and federal agencies said the ban on shellfishing applies to sport and commercial fishermen and includes all clams, oysters, mussels and scallops. State officials said in a news release that all commercial shellfish taken from the affected area since Oct. 1 were being removed from wholesale and retail sale, and will be tested for the toxin. South Puget Sound commercial shellfish go to wholesalers and retailers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. South Puget Sound produces two-thirds of the Puget Sound harvest, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state is the nation's largest oyster producer. Symptoms of shellfish poisoning include vomiting, nausea, muscle weakness, and tingling of lips, mouth and teeth, the news release said. Loss of balance and lack of muscular coordination can follow. Those struck generally do not die, but elderly people and those with other medical conditions can be affected more severely.

Iraqi officials have accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its European allies of softening their hostility toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the Aug. 20 cease-fire began because they want a stake in lucrative contracts in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s massive postwar reconstruction <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has agreed to drop its `` right to search ships in the Strait of Hormuz,'' the only gateway to the strategic <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had claimed that until a formal peace treaty was signed, it was in a state of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and had the right to search vessels sailing into the gulf to determine whether they carried war-related materials for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has disputed this. But apart from one Iraqi vessel that was harrassed immediately after the cease-fire, there have been no reports of any other Iraqi vessels, or ships heading for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ports, being stopped by the Iranians. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, under the supervision of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and his special representative, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, were `` more successful'' than two previous rounds in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He did not say when the reported agreement would take effect. But <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as questioning whether the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation had the authority to seal any pact. He complained that the Iraqis, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, `` did not have sufficient authority to make decisions. `` In order to be successful, the parties involved must have the authority and the decision-making power. Otherwise, talks will not progress and will become more complicated,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. `` The Iraqi delegates feel somewhat confused as to what they should do,'' he added.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s claim that he performed a public service by criticizing a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has renewed debate over whether secrecy is sometimes used to hide policies of dubious merit. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> touched off a hot debate three weeks ago when he accused the spy agency of stirring up civil unrest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to provoke a crackdown by the leftist Sandinista government. As authority for his statement, he cited `` clear <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> testimony'' before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee now is investigating whether the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat indirectly received classified material given by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, then violated the chamber's rules against public disclosure of classified information <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has contended he did not. `` Of course we have to protect genuine government secrets,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who as speaker has access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, said last week. `` But a democracy must never allow secrecy to be used as a cloak to hide bad policy from the public.'' But those who deal routinely with top-secret information, the members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees, say the notion that one lawmaker can decide to speak out about a covert operation is dangerous. `` If you allowed every individual member to make his own judgments about revealing classified information, it would be the end of our system,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said he was not commenting directly on the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case, but was speaking of broad principles. `` All discipline would break down, because there's virtually no policy around here that's unanimous. Even in a democracy, there are things that have to be kept secret,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> risks being shut out of participation in foreign policy formulation if it ca n't keep secrets, he said. Highly advanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technologies that cost millions of dollars to develop are an example of secrets that must be kept, intelligence officials say. Delicate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relationships with the intelligence services of other nations also depend on secrecy. And lives can be at stake if secrecy of covert operations is breached, they note. In the case of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disclosure, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conservatives have argued that the speaker placed members of the Nicaraguan political opposition in jeopardy by linking them to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, and handed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> a propaganda bonanza. Covert operations are actions designed to influence events in other countries while hiding the involvement of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They range from small-scale actions, involving no more than a handful of people, to major paramilitary efforts like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of the Contras or of the anti-Soviet Afghan rebels. Most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree that such actions sometimes are necessary, particularly where normal diplomatic solutions are impossible. But <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> cautioned that they must be chosen carefully. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not covertly do things that conflict with publicly stated policies or generally held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> values, he said. It was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> abuses in the 1960s and 70s _ planning for assassinations of foreign leaders and domestic spying _ that led to creation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees a dozen years ago to pass judgment on the spy agency's most sensitive activities. In defending his comments, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was simply highlighting that sort of duplicity in the administration's behavior: giving lip service to peace talks between the government and the Contras while at the same time making a secret attempt to undermine those talks by provoking civil unrest <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s criticism also could be taken as an indirect complaint about his own intelligence oversight panel, which under the law would have to have been notified by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> about the covert action. Intelligence committee members have a variety of remedies if they disagree with a proposed covert operation. Since they authorize all <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spending one year at a time, they can threaten to cut off money for the activity, or include legal language barring it. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s contingency fund, once as large as $ 50 million, was cut to roughly half that amount in recent years because of a desire for more congressional control. Committee members also debate covert action proposals and often can head them off if there is widespread bipartisan opposition. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> prefers to have congressional support so that it wo n't be left out in the cold should a covert action become public. In <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s case, he said he had known about the activity since August 1987 and had repeatedly argued against it privately without effect. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' least used, most potent and perhaps ultimate weapon against a covert action is a threat to go public. `` That's the only real hammer,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who left the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last year in a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> over its classification practices `` There's nothing morally wrong in supporting forces in any part of the world that reflect the goals of a democratic country,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` But you move from that principle down a slippery slope rapidly. You start creating forces to reflect your democratic values. ... You let it get out of control, you start paying people who do n't give a damn about your morals.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, he said, was speaking on behalf of a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who would have preferred to see <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> served through a negotiated peace, and not through what they see as provocation. But Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was wrong to go public, even if it was in an off-the-cuff remark. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was particularly stung by the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> incident because it doomed chances for his bill to tighten congressional oversight of covert operations. `` There is nothing to prevent him from going down and talking to the president one-on-one, calling the head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the secretary of state,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` There are a number of ways to do it. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is not the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the president bears responsibility for the decisions.''

 The radiation-contaminated town of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, near the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, is being razed because it wo n't be fit for human habitation for decades, Pravda said Saturday. Officials even plan to erase the Chernobyl adminstrative region by eliminating <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government bodies in the area and transferring seven villages to a neighboring region, the newspaper reported. `` That will be the end to the Chernobyl problem,'' Pravda noted in an article that objected to the plans. Pravda complained that local authorities are taking drastic action without trying hard enough to clean up the 800-year-old town. It questioned why the decision was made without prior announcement and without consulting the people who wanted to go back to the area to live. Pravda said the town's fate was decided by the local <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combine </ORGANIZATION>, and the newspaper suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> or higher government organs should have been involved in the decision. Chernobyl, once home to 10,000 people, was evacuated in April 1986 after a fire at the power plant with the same name spewed radiation worldwide. Officials said 31 people were killed. `` The radiation situation in <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> is such that full life of people can not resume for decades,'' <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>, chief engineer of the nuclear power agency now running the power plant, was quoted as saying. Local authorities in the town, which is 11 miles from the plant, burned one house and then bulldozed two streets of homes in the central district, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. Some of the buildings were just three years old. At first, authorities planned to tear down only dilapidated houses, <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> wrote in a power plant newspaper quoted by Pravda. But `` by the time normal life can return, all the houses will be equally dilapidated and living in them will be impossible,'' he was quoted as saying. `` There will be scarcely anything to preserve at all!'' Pravda noted that the town of <LOCATION> Gden </LOCATION> is about the same distance from the power plant as <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> and has been decontaminated and repopulated. In the revitalized Byelorussian town, new water lines were set down, streets repaved, roofs were replaced, and all 245 families returned six months after the accident, Pravda said. `` There is not a single such example in the Ukrainian part of the danger zone,'' even though the wind brought more radioactivity to <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> than to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> after the accident, the newspaper said. Pravda also reported that 994 people, mostly middle-aged and elderly, have defied bans and moved back into the Ukrainian section of the danger zone, an 18-mile radius from the accident site. Reports this spring said 100 people had returned to <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> itself, but <PERSON> Pravda </PERSON> said they were given no consideration in the decision to raze the town. Gamma background radiation levels in <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> were 0.1 milliroentgen per hour as of June, equal to the natural radioactivity in mountainous areas and twice that of the Ukrainian capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> to the south, the newspaper said. <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> regional officials said last year that at least 27 towns and villages were too contaminated to be populated in the foreseeable future. A new town for workers at the power plant was built 35 miles from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Violent riots sweeping this North African Arab nation grew out of years of frustration with the rigid socialist system and a declining economy that has created a growing crowd of jobless youth. The precise motives and causes of different groups of rioters in the past several days have been difficult to disentangle. A shadowy Islamic fundamentalist movement on Saturday said it started the unrest and warned it would unleash even greater violence unless its demands are met. The previously unknown `` Movement for Algerian Renewal'' presented a series of demands, including satisfying the immediate needs of the population and replacing the government of President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. Since a 1965 military coup, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has been under a stern, Soviet-style government. The constitution declares Islam the state religion but says socialism is the only path to independence. The revolt began Tuesday with spontaneous acts of violence by youngsters without any distinct political or social cause. Their slogans attacked the high cost of living and the `` fat cats'' living in luxury, but they offered no remedies. Some chants supported competing Algerian soccer teams. Moslem fundamentalists, recognizable in the fast-living capital by their beards and flowing white robes, began taking over the movement Thursday. Small groups of them were seen taking the lead of violent crowds and pointing out the luxury stores and restaurants for the wealthy as suitable targets for the masses' wrath But later, the Moslems were seen reasoning with the crowd and encouraging them to disperse peacefully. With the army's tanks and armored personnel carriers deployed at strategic points throughout the capital and troops with fixed bayonets ready to shoot to maintain public order, the older and more experienced fundamentalists had no difficulty getting their point across. On Saturday, they flung off the veil and proclaimed themselves the `` leaders of the movement of revolt'' in a statement distributed to news organizations. But it was not known whether the Islamic fundamentalists actually set the protests in motion or were rushing to the front to try to lead the parade in the direction they preferred. So far, the fundamentalist movement is alone in its attempt to make political capital out of the revolt. No one has demanded a limitation of the soaring birthrate or measures to cope with unemployment, which has reached 40 percent in the larger cities. The fundamentalists have been reluctant to address these deeper causes of popular discontent. Their demand for the removal of the government did not include the ouster of Bendjedid personally, falling in line with the widespread feeling that responsibility for the regime's failures lies not with the president but with the `` fat cats'' conspiring to obstruct his policies. The president has been the main advocate of an economic austerity program permitting <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to live within its means during a period of low prices for oil and gas, which make up 97 percent of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s exports. Nearly 60 percent of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s 25 million people are less than 20 years old. In the middle of the demographic explosion, Bendjedid has fought opposition within the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the only legal party, to move away from a strictly government-directed economy. Under the austerity program, prices on many formerly subsidized goods have risen 40 percent since January. A block of butter that cost 50 cents 10 months ago, for example, now costs almost a dollar. On Saturday, the army continued to move troops into the major cities, and the military command issued repeated warnings for people to remain off the streets. Shopkeepers took no chances and began lowering curtains and barring shop fronts shortly after noon on Saturday. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> operates on an Islamic week, and Saturday and Sunday are normally working days.

<HEAD>Residents Skeptical Of Radon Reports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Homeowner </PERSON> <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> DeJonge </PERSON> can empathize with state officials who say it's difficult to convince people that colorless, odorless radioactive radon gas collecting in their homes can be deadly. `` I brought it up last year at the voting booths and they laughed me out onto the street. They said, ` do n't be ridiculous, it's all a scam,''' said Ms. <PERSON> DeJonge </PERSON>. Tests conducted last year found that her home had radon levels 45 times the federal safety standard. Ms. <PERSON> DeJonge </PERSON> lives in the Whispering Hills development where tests Sept. 30 found 60 of 75 homes had radon levels above the federal safety standard. One home had levels 800 times greater then the federal standard, possibly the highest ever recorded in a house, officials said Thursday. Officials believe the gas in <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, a rural community about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, rises through the ground from the Reading Prong, a formation of uranium-bearing rock that extends from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of uranium. Health officials say radon is second only to smoking as a cause of lung cancer deaths. Last year, Ms. <PERSON> DeJonge </PERSON> installed a simple ventilation system in her basement for $ 950 to alleviate the radon problem, and became the town radon crier. She gave up after consistently meeting with derision from neighbors who thought it was a hoax perpetrated by the burgeoning radon remediation industry. The federal standard for radon is 4 picocuries, a unit of radiation measurement. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimates that level is the annual equivalent of smoking one-half pack of cigarettes a day or having 200 to 300 chest X-rays. One lhouse tested by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> in the Whispering Hills development registered 3,500 picocuries. State officials said the unidentified homeowner was having the problem corrected. State officials canvassed the neighborhood last weekend, urging residents to place charcoal-filled canisters in their basements to test for the gas. But at many homes, they met with slammed doors, suspicion, reluctance, or skepticism. Others said they have tested, but put off having work done to lower radon levels because they distrust what may be hype. State officials say they continue to battle apathy despite discoveries of 18 similar clusters in the state where radon is seeping through house foundations and building to dangerous levels. Calls to a state radon hot line increase tenfold after flurries of publicity, such as reports last month that 29 percent of homes in seven states had elevated radon levels. But the calls quickly drop off, officials said. `` It's not a problem you can see. It's not a problem that can be associated with a man-made contamination problem. It's a natural phenomenon that's been here all along,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isotopes </ORGANIZATION>, a radioactive testing firm. `` Radon poses the highest risk to smokers, and if you ca n't convince people to stop smoking it's going to be hard to interest them in radon.''

 Here is the text of Saturday's Democratic radio address by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, D-N. This is Senator <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and I'm here to present the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address. This past year has been one of considerable, even historic, bipartisan cooperation here in the nation's capital. We have sent the president a hugely important trade bill, catastrophic health insurance, and after one-half century, at long last, welfare reform. Mr. President, you've invited me to the Rose Garden Thursday afternoon when you'll sign the welfare bill, and so I'll see you then. But this is the last time we will have this exchange on a Saturday, so I would like to talk about one last great bipartisan effort we could have together. This is the Omnibus Drug Bill which we introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. Today you talked about the House bill. I'll talk about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. May I say, we surprised ourselves. Over the last few years, as the most recent drug epidemic has spread across the nation, there have been all too familiar efforts to make this a partisan issue, as if one party knew more about how to cope with the emergency, or cared more, or would spend more, or would punish more, or just plain demagogue more, most of which ended in stalemate and name-calling. This time we decided we could do better. In May, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> appointed me and Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to head a Democratic working group. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> appointed Senators <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> to do likewise. The two groups met, and we learned, to our surprise, just how much we agreed. First, we agreed that there is an epidemic. It is primarily associated with crack, a derivative of cocaine, which first appeared in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> in 1983. By 1985, it had reached <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, by 1986 <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and then across the country. Since then, hospital emergency room admissions due to illicit drugs have increased ten-fold. One half of all juveniles in detention at this moment are the result of drug-related crimes. Almost half of juveniles arrested have been arrested at least five times. We agreed that the federal government has a major responsibility here. These drugs come into the country illegally. If the federal government did not prevent their entry, it must help with their aftermath. First, then, a drug czar, a member of the Cabinet, to lead this effort. Next, a real effort. Our interdiction program is pathetic when you think what is needed. When we started the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, we created some 2,100 special agents. Fifteen years later, there are not quite 2,900. Federal aid to street law enforcement has all but disappeared. There are not nearly enough federal prosecutors or federal prisons. Above all, there is almost no federal support for treatment. We do n't know much about treatment for crack, but we do know that young people who get into drugs soon wish they could get out, and there are millions of them. One American in 10 has used an illicit drug in the last month. Clearly we must provide treatment on request. Whatever you do in an epidemic, you do n't close your hospitals. And so, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, on Monday we introduced a bipartisan 600-page, $ 2.6 billion drug bill. It marks a major departure in federal policy. We allocate 40 percent of funds to the supply side, which is to say, programs such as crop eradication and border interdiction. There is a death penalty, eviction, forfeiture, a three-time loser life sentence. But 60 percent of the funds go to the demand side _ testing, education, treatment. Senator <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> are the lead sponsors. Among the many co-sponsors, you will find Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. We need your help. We have four legislative days left in the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We ca n't pass the House bill. It has just too many extras, some of which you mentioned. But we can pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will take a clean bill. And so I would ask, Mr. President, send word that you will sign the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, and we'll get it to your desk And so good day. Good luck to us all.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 My fellow Americans, you're probably just as delighted as I am with the wonderful news about unemployment that we received yesterday. The unemployment rate dropped fully two-tenths of a percent in September to 5.4 percent for all civilian workers and 5.3 percent when you include the military. But behind these numbers is more good news _ 255,000 got new jobs last month in the non-farm sector, which means that since the recovery began in 1982, over 18 million new jobs have been created. There's nothing more pleasing than watching <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> move forward with purpose and the news reminds us yet again that this great nation is, as Senator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, the envy of the world. Now, I'd like to turn to another subject, the war on drugs. I want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by a long shot, but we're doing better and our nation is united against this scourge as never before. Right now there is a drug bill on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. It has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but has n't even come up for consideration in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and time is fast running out. The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express our national commitment to five simple, but powerful, words. Those words are `` zero tolerance'' and `` Just say no.'' When we say zero tolerance, we mean simply that we've had it. We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay. We believe that when those who sell drugs are caught, they must make redress for the damage they cause. That's why the administration, personified by the leadership and passion of this administration's point man on drugs, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the national voice of conscience, my wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, has advocated tougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners and the drug dealers. We are doing this by seizing the ill-gotten possessions of drug dealers and their accomplices. Those fancy cars and fancy houses and bank accounts full of dirty money are n't really theirs. They were bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants. We do not tolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers, and we wo n't let people who are poisoning the blood of our children get away with it either Those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing to peddle their toxins must get the message as well. We will not tolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the same quarters where disadvantaged Americans struggle to build a better life. We want to kick the vermin out and keep them out. Nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legal challenges when we do arrest them, and we must work to see them jailed. And that's why we're advocating a change in the law that will allow exceptions in the so-called `` exclusionary rule'' to permit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by the police. Nor can our vigilance cease once they're behind bars. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed, and I support, drug testing for all who seek early release from jail, to send them this message, `` You do n't go free until you're drug free.'' We wo n't have a drug-free society until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to our shores. We must protect our coasts, and that means using the resources and calling on the noble men and women of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to protect us. We've sought increases in the drug enforcement budget, but in the past we've encountered consistent resistance from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I requested $ 538 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1989, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hacked $ 33 million away. I think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kind of political behavior, and I imagine you agree with me. But there is a way more vital than all of these, that we can express our revulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drug peddler. These people seem to feel nothing, no fear, no remorse, nothing, when they pull out a machine gun and murder a police officer in the line of duty. The bill that has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provides for the death penalty for these vicious killers. We must, we need, and we will have this law. Now, there are those who've opposed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill because it includes the death penalty. Others oppose it because of the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. I believe these people are more concerned with the abstract rights of criminals than the right of our society to save itself from those, in this country and outside, who seek their fortune in our national misfortune. I challenge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to get that bill passed. The nation demands it and there's no time to waste. Compromises on the key provisions are unacceptable. We must let the drug kingpins know your days are numbered. Our cause is just, and we will triumph. Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

 A chemical cleanup crew planned to blow up a rusting cylinder Sunday without knowing for sure what was inside or if it could explode prematurely, and officials asked 3,500 residents to evacuate just in case. The 4-foot-long container at the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant could contain up to 30 pounds of hydrogen cyanide gas, federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Hydrogen cyanide is one of the most poisonous substances made, says <PERSON> Merck </PERSON>'s Index, a directory of chemicals and drugs. As little as 50 milligrams, or a quantity one-sixth the size of an aspirin, can kill an adult, the book says. Sunday's plan was for three men to weigh the corroded tank, carry it 100 yards to a bunker, split the sides with explosives and start a gasoline-and-diesel fire to destroy the contents. But just moving the tank could trigger a reaction that would cause an explosion before the men could reach the bunker, federal officials said. The workers are from <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. As a precaution, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and Mayor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> asked a third of the town's 9,000 residents to stay away from their homes between 12:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. They planned to have 120 public officials on hand, to bus residents to a school gymnasium and to evacuate the elderly and handicapped to hospitals and nursing homes. `` A lot of people are callous toward this thing,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said Friday of residents of an area that has had chemical plants for decades. `` They have been raised with chemicals and they do n't see anything wrong with this. `` I have asked them to go as a favor to me. I've known a lot of these people for years. If they wo n't go, I've asked them to leave their fingerprints and dental records -LRB- for identification -RRB-.'' If the cylinder is empty, all will be fine, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, coordinator of the government's cleanup at the plant. `` The primary question is, ` Is it full or empty or what?''' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said. Chemical stabilizers added to the tank's contents may have deteriorated and pressure inside may be slowly rising, <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said. Hydrogen cyanide is used as a raw material by chemical companies, forming the base for such things as acrylic waxes and food packaging, and to kill rodents and insects in ship holds. A plan to destroy the cylinder Sept. 25 fell through and the evacuation was called off when workers hired to move the container balked. A new company was hired for Sunday's procedure. The Artel plant formerly was owned by <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fike </PERSON>, a 35-year maker of `` specialty chemicals.'' <PERSON> Fike </PERSON> openly criticized environmental regulations, saying they were too restrictive, and his plant often resembled a jerry-built brewery with rusted pipes linking massive tanks. <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION> bought the plant from <PERSON> Fike </PERSON>. When the company was unable to pay workers, a judge ordered the plant shut. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> stepped in to dispose of the 3,400 drums and barrels at the site. Nothing is known for certain about the tank slated for destruction, except that it was built more than 20 years ago and has n't been moved or used in nearly seven years. `` It's probably a possibility'' that something else might be inside, `` but <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Fike </PERSON> -RRB- has told me that it has hydrogen cyanide in it or nothing at all,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said. `` I certainly have no reason to doubt that.'' If moving the tank triggers a reaction, the demolition experts will have to act fast. `` If the cylinder starts getting hot, they will have a minute, minute-and-a-half to put it down,'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said. `` We've made sandbag stands. They can just set it down, set up the detonation cord, get off-site, put an airpack on and pop it.'' `` Pop it'' means blowing one end off the tank, relieving pressure and preventing a rupture that could send shrapnel into other tanks at the site. `` We would then have hydrogen cyanide released to the atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said. `` We assume the whole 30 pounds would go up in the air, and we've done air flow models to find out where it would go. That's why we recommended the 1,000-yard evacuation zone.'' Forcing an evacuation has n't been easy for <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>. Some residents do n't want to be bothered, either because of their trust in the chemical industry in the heavily industrialized <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, or because they agreed to leave their homes Sept. 25, when the operation was first scheduled but then canceled. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> says there are only three things that can cause another cancellation _ bad weather, stagnant air or `` if not enough people leave town.'' `` I've had people calling from 1 -LCB- miles away asking me if they should leave,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said. `` I'm telling them they're perfectly safe but that they can leave if they want to. `` I ca n't tell them to stay and then have a cloud go out and kill 9,000 people.''

 Delegates to the organizing conference of a <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> nationalist group on Saturday criticized management of the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> economy and protested Soviet control over the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, a source said. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Veveris </PERSON>, a former political prisoner monitoring live broadcasts of the conference in the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, on state-run radio and television, said particularly harsh criticism was leveled at management of the republic's industry and agriculture. Speakers also complained about pollution in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> takeover of the republic in 1940, <PERSON> Veveris </PERSON> said. The remarks came on the first day of a two-day congress of the People's Front of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. The group is similar to organizations formed in the neighboring <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to make nationalist demands and push Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. The Estonian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, claiming 60,000 members, held its organizing conference Oct. 1-2, and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s is slated for Oct. 22-23. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said more than 1,000 delegates, including some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were attending the meeting in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>. It said the group has 130,000 members. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s population is 2.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said among the participants was the new president of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON>, who assumed his post Thursday. Also attending, the news agency said, were members of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, more than 100,000 Latvians braved a rainstorm in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> to demonstrate in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, Veveris and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the demonstration had a festive air, with participants arriving at the forested <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> park in national costume. Entire families attended and enjoyed improvised concerts of folk music. <PERSON> Veveris </PERSON> said these were nationalist songs recalling <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s brief independence between the world wars. <PERSON> Veveris </PERSON> said demonstrators waved the yellow, green and red flag that flew in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> during its independence. Protesters also carried posters saying `` No to Russification'' and `` No Occupation,'' referring to migration of Russians into the republic and Soviet control over the region.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> tests on candy believed to poisoned with strychnine were unable to identify the substance and the agency is still investigating, an agency spokesman said Saturday. A powder was found on a piece of candy in a package of Sunkist Fun Fruits and Dinosaurs bought at a northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> grocery store. <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said Friday that state police laboratory tests had determined the powder was strychnine. But <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said the agency's lab in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was unable to confirm the powder was strychnine. He said only a small piece of the candy in question was available for testing, and officials were trying to determine why the results from the two labs differed. `` Our lab is n't sure what it is,'' <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. `` They seem to think they had enough, and if it was strychnine the lab workers think they would have detected it.'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials have completed an inspection of the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, Inc. plant in <LOCATION> Flemington </LOCATION>, where the candy was packaged, and plants in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> also will be inspected for traces of strychnine, <PERSON> Wilkens </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is in charge of the investigation, he said. <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> initially said the powder most likely was harmless cornstarch that could have come from a mold, which is made of cornstarch. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> did not immediately respond to a message left at his home. Strychnine is commonly used in rodent killer and may cause deaths in small doses or can cause violent convulsions, loss of muscle control, intense pain and impaired respiration. The candy in question was packaged Aug. 4, and the number on the outside of the box is 8H04EF. Those boxes will still be recalled as an extra precaution, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said. The batch was distributed in an area ranging from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and west to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> made the candy for <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, which packaged and distributed the boxes under the Sunkist label, he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday that `` time is fast running out,'' and pressed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to approve a House-passed anti-drug bill before adjournment. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as he has in several other speeches during the past week, said he supports the death penalty provision in the measure. But in the Democratic response, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s version as the better legislation and argued the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill `` has just too many extras.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill has many good and tough provisions that express our national commitment to five simple but powerful words _ those words are ` zero tolerance' and ` Just say no,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, lifting the slogan from his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s anti-drug education campaign. `` By zero tolerance, we mean simply, that we've had it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address from Camp David, Md. `` We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he supports moves to deny federal benefits to anyone convicted of drug sales or use, user penalties and allowing the admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in `` good faith.'' While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its version of the legislation earlier this month on a 375-30 vote, the measure has not yet come before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must, we need and we will have this law,'' the president said. `` I challenge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to get that bill passed.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill includes the death penalty for those who authorize drug-related killings or anyone who kills a law enforcement officer in a drug-related crime. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation also has the death penalty provision but spends 60 percent of its $ 2.6 billion package to reduce demand and only 40 percent for cutting supply. `` It marks a major departure in federal policy,'' noted <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>. The bill introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Monday has wide bipartisan backing, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> noted, included the support of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice president candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. As he has done in many radio addresses, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put in a plug for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate his `` point man'' on the administration's anti-drug fight. The president said he backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s move to require that any prisoner must be proven drug-free before being released from jail. `` You do n't go free until you're drug free,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Senators have been negotiating privately over crucial time-limiting agreements that would enable <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass the anti-drug measure before adjournment, expected to come at the end of this week. But they agree the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will run out of time if long debates ensue over controversial issues such as the user penalties or the admission of illegally seized evidence. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> overcame its time obstacles, it still would need time to reach a compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. And the measure, even if enacted, faces serious financing problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill is a two-year package that would authorize about $ 2 billion in new spending, but only $ 450 million may be available immediately, according to several sponsors of the legislation. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` send word that you will sign the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and we'll get it to your desk.''

<HEAD>`Siege of Atlanta' Ends With 40 More Arrests At Abortion Clinic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police arrested 40 abortion protesters Saturday at the end of a five-day `` Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' that landed more than 450 demonstrators in jail but it was not clear who, if anyone, won. `` They'll be back and we'll be here every day they are,'' predicted Police Maj. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>. Police were criticized for rough handling of demonstrators on the first three days of the week's protests but used gentler tactics on the last two days. More than 1,100 anti-abortion demonstrators have been jailed in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> since a group called Operation Rescue began picketing and blocking entrances to abortion clinics during the Democratic National Convention in July. The group has called a national `` Day of Rescue'' for Oct. 29 and hopes to have demonstrations in 100 cities. Operation Rescue said it would file a civil rights suit next week in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on behalf of the Rev. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who said he suffered serious injuries and inadequate medical attention when he was arrested Tuesday. `` We would have liked to have more people come out but we feel that we touched the hearts of Christians,'' said Operation Rescue spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>. `` It was a pioneer effort and from that aspect, we're pleased.'' The movement ran low on people willing to go to jail, but more arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> late in the week for Saturday's protest. Demonstration leaders claimed success through the week, saying at least some of the women with appointments at the four clinics they picketed were persuaded to change their minds. But a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> characterized the demonstrators as `` religious extremists who want to impose their religious moral views on this entire country.'' `` I think what they achieved is ... further alienating the American public. The public abhors extremist tactics of intimidation,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the league, who was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at the start of the week. She made her remarks in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. About 70 volunteers were on duty Saturday to take women through the picket lines into the clinic. Police reminded demonstrators that they were violating an injunction when they tried to persuade one woman not to enter the clinic for an abortion. The injunction prohibits, among other things, the bothering or harassing of people entering or leaving the clinics. Estimates varied about how many women were dissuaded from having abortions during the week. <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> deBlasi </PERSON>, administrator of the Midtown Clinic where there were 53 arrests Friday and 40 on Saturday, said about 80 percent of those with clinic appointments Friday kept them. Operation Rescue claims many of the women entering the clinic were `` plants'' sent in to give the impression of normal operation. Demonstrators picketed the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pretrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> later Saturday to protest what they said was an intentional delay in releasing protesters who posted bond. About 390 of those arrested during the week remained in custody Saturday afternoon. But city officials, who warned earlier that those arrested would be treated like other prisoners, said it would take days to process the demonstrators out because their paperwork is not being processed separately from other prisoners. `` -LRB- Operation Rescue founder -RRB- <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said they were coming to paralyze the city government,'' said <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s corrections director `` They've lived up to their purpose to overwhelm the criminal justice system. `` They tore up the tracks, now they're complaining because the train wo n't roll.''

 Thousands of people living near an atomic power plant fled in panic Saturday and squeezed onto trains leaving the area when they mistook a drill for a real emergency, officials said. At least 25,000 people living near the Tarapur Atomic Power Plant fled after authorities declared an emergency at 5.20 a.m. and carried out a check of evacuation procedures within a 10-mile radius of the plant, officials said. The Tarapur plant, set up in 1969, is 75 miles north of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. It is <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s oldest nuclear power plant. G.B. <PERSON> Pingulkar </PERSON>, the top government official in the area, said at least 25,000 people fled, despite announcements beforehand that a drill to test emergency responses would be held. `` People came to me asking if the plant was leaking,'' <PERSON> Pingulkar </PERSON> said. `` I was surprised.'' An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Boisar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> about a mile from Tarapur said thousands of panic-stricken residents crowded into trains bound for <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> after the emergency warning. `` Ticket sales were at least four times the daily average,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The panic spread also to industries in Tarapur town and many factories closed due to absenteeism.

<TEXT>
 A financial planner who disappeared with $ 25 million and left notes of apology for his former clients was arrested as a fugitive Saturday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after being expelled from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents said. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>, 52, has been a federal fugitive since August on charges of embezzlement and mail fraud. When he was arrested by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents when he got off a plane in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> was carrying $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money and `` a sizable amount of Taiwanese currency,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, in charge of the agency's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> is accused of masterminding a scheme that may have swindled nearly 50 investors, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said in a federal complaint filed Aug. 29 in federal court. `` Many of the victims were employees of his own firm,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> sent hand-written notes of apology to his clients when he dropped out of sight Aug. 10. In addition to individual investors, <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> had a `` longstanding pattern of embezzlement'' from about 25 professional associations handling pension funds and other assets for members, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. He added that the investigation of <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>'s activities continues and additional charges are expected to be filed. He declined to give details. Attorneys for a group of investos who have filed a civil suit against <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> said up to $ 25 million is missing from client accounts. `` We think we'll be successful in locating some of those funds,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know how much. We just do n't know how much is left.'' <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> made telephone calls to his wife and to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorneys after his disappearance, but authorities did not know his whereabouts until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> reported his possible location there, agents said. Authorities then found him and arranged his expulsion, said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> could be brought back to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> within a week. But if he fights extradition, the process could take as many as 45 days, he said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> is accused of illegally transferring clients' money to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bank account since 1978 and issuing false statements indicating investments in money-market funds and certificates of deposit, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said in the federal complaint. The complaint cites five counts of embezzlement and two counts of mail fraud. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> faces 35 years in prison and fines in excess of $ 1.5 million if convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said.

He added, `` What I'm concerned about is teen-agers with AK-47s and Uzis that are driving around cities in this country killing people, and cop-killer bullets and undetectable plastic guns which are threatening the safety of people.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> discussed the gun-control issue in an interview Friday after delivering a campaign speech in this mountain city.

The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> also has sent letters to its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> members criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a gun-control advocate, she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>, a federal liaison with the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, declined to discuss the organization's advertising strategy and said he did not know whether the group would run anti-Dukakis commercials in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> was spreading the word nationwide that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had favored restrictions on gun ownership in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Throughout his political career, Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been openly hostile to private firearms ownership,'' <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supported a 1976 proposal to ban private ownership of pistols and revolvers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The measure failed in a statewide referendum, he said. <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had modified his stand since entering the presidential race, but that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> still feared he would support gun control as president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in the interview, said, `` If somebody runs these commercials ... then obviously I am going to fight back. And I'm not only going to fight back to clear up the the record; I'm going to make sure that people in this country really understand how bad -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record has been on crime and drugs. Ms. <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON> said she had seen scripts of the ads, including one featuring actor <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on gun control and a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program.

 One of two people killed when thousands celebrated the defeat of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was buried Saturday, and the priest denounced the disappearance of dissidents during the general's 15-year rule. Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Jara </PERSON> `` was killed in the streets. God does n't like that,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said in a eulogy before about 60 people at the <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> home. The boy was killed by an unidentified gunman Thursday, one day after Chileans voted to reject <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bid to extend his rule until 1997. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> criticized the torture and disappearance of government opponents since <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> toppled the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist, who died in the 1973 coup. Human rights groups estimate 700 people have been killed and thousands tortured since <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, took power. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 31, the only other known death from the anti-government demonstrations, was to be buried Sunday. Police acknowlege they shot and killed <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. Police also said at least 19 people leaving a huge rally staged by opposition groups Friday were injured by soldiers firing birdshot and pellets. One remained hospitalized at the <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> with an eye injury, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION> reported. One American photographer was hospitalized and journalists from several other nations walked around with bruises and bandages from blows and kicks by police during the demonstrations. `` I expect to be out of here on Monday,'' said <PERSON> Liliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> <PERSON> Delrio </PERSON>, 31, of the Long Island-based newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said she was clubbed on the head by police and then kicked repeatedly in the back as she lay on the ground. The incident occurred after dark Friday when police dispersed a crowd of several hundred youths who left the rally and tried to stage a demonstration near the national palace. A delegation of foreign journalists delivered a protest to the National Police on Saturday. It said police attacks on more than 20 journalists in the demonstrations were unprovoked. After meeting the delegation, Police Col. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said, `` There have been isolated cases'' of police attacks on reporters, `` but that type of behavior does not reflect national police policy.'' `` Orders have been issued again this morning that incidents like that are not to happen again,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. Opposition leaders are pressing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to modify the 1980 constitution that set up Wednesday's referendum and that allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to remain in power through March 1990 despite his defeat. Presidential and congressional elections now are scheduled for December 1989. Opposition leaders and many Chileans want them held sooner. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has refused.

 The armed forces dismissed a general and four other officers for allowing cocaine worth $ 10 million to be smuggled out of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the military high command said Saturday. The dishonorable discharges came one day after officials announced the discovery and destruction of a jungle cocaine laboratory that produced tens of millions of dollars of drugs. Former Gen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrazola </PERSON> and the four officers were accused of protecting a clandestine airstrip in the <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION> coca leaf producing region. The high command said nearly four tons of cocaine paste _ worth at least $ 10 million _ were smuggled out of the airstrip. The identities of the other officers were not immediately available. The military did not say how long the airstrip was believed to have operated. Planes took off from the airstrip for the <LOCATION> Beni </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> regions where labs converted the cocaine paste into cocaine, and the officers were paid to protect the traffickers, the high command says. No figure was given for the payments. `` President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, in learning of these irregularities, ordered an in-depth investigation and the prosecution of officers involved,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnica </PERSON>, the army commander. Last week, the government also announced it arrested one judge and was investigating reports that others had received money from traffickers in return for the prisoners' release from prison. The impoverished South American country of 6.7 million produces an estimated one third of the cocaine that reaches the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents said that the drug lab destroyed Thursday was the biggest ever discovered in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Interior Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> said the lab produced 3.5 tons of pure cocaine a week. Twelve Bolivian anti-drug police and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents discovered the lab on a helicopter sweep over sparsely populated jungle 400 miles northeast of La Paz, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and military presence in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> since July 1986 when 175 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops spent three months assisting <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> police in anti-drug operations. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> describes the anti-drug operations in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> as the most effective in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In the past year, police said they have destroyed 2,000 cocaine processing pits, 12 cocaine processing labs and captured eight tons of cocaine paste. At least 35 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> trainers now work with <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> police, navy and air force pilots. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents also assist in anti-drug operations and train the 700-man Leopard police force operating in the <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Beni </PERSON> regions.

 Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are ignoring President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s order to pay taxes owed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> escrow account established to pressure strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last April ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies with offices in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to withhold taxes they owe its government and instead pay them into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escrow account. The idea was that the money would be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> once <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has resigned or been forced from office. Six months later, that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> account remains nearly empty as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies routinely ignore the order to pay into it, according to a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., said senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials told him they estimate that the escrow account is $ 65 million short of what it should be at this point <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> gave no figures on how much money is in the account. But other congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it contained only $ 3.9 million, a figure that one administration official described as `` in the ballpark.'' Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses have told the administration they did not want to pay into the account out of fears there were insufficient accounting controls to keep track of how much each company paid, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Secor </PERSON>, a Panamanian specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Secor </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, not the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, keeps records on who pays and how much. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused his repeated requests for that information. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s order was in two parts: the first that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies do not pay the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government and, second, that the money be placed in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> fund. `` Regardless of the second part, most if not all are complying with the first,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said, adding that the administration had put the most priority on keeping the money out of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime's hands. That explanation has been greeted with skepticism on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, partly because the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government is allowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to continue operating there. `` I would n't be surprised if -LRB- the companies -RRB- continue to pay'' taxes to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertelsen </PERSON>, a Gejdenson foreign policy adviser. `` I just doubt <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> lets them stay there without paying.'' But <PERSON> Secor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> simply can not afford, politically or economically, to throw <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations out. `` They do n't want business confidence to erode anymore,'' he said. `` It's important for the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government to create the impression of normalcy.'' <PERSON> Secor </PERSON> also rejected the notion that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not applying pressure on the American firms, saying that Panamanian officials have used legal, financial and physical threats to try to get the tax money. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen have reported threats such as `` ` You're going to be in trouble,' or even ` You're family is going to be in trouble if you do n't pay you're company's taxes','' <PERSON> Secor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, in an interview Friday, said administration officials have refused repeated invitations to testify at subcommittee hearings to discuss the escrow account because the revelations would be an embarrassment to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his presidential campaign. `` It's one more demonstration that they've blown it,'' the Democratic lawmaker said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his 85-year-old mother lashed back at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday, angrily responding to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s barrage of attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' crime record and citing their family's own suffering from violent crime. It was a moment of rare public emotion by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spoke of the beating and robbery of his father at age 77, and the killing of his brother <PERSON> Stelian </PERSON> by a hit-and-run driver at the age of 43. It was made even more so by the presence of the candidate's mother <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, who offered her own impassioned defense of her son She accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` mangling the truth, of trying to divide us,'' of suggesting that as the son of immigrants <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` does not love the flag quite as much,'' and of being behind letters sent to residents of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town saying her brothers were communists. `` Can anyone get this low?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' mother said. Campaigning on the <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> campus where his mother and father attended school, the Democratic presidential nominee responded forcefully to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges _ escalated a day earlier _ that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had shown insensitivity to the victims of crime. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was trying to divert attention from his own `` pathetic record'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on drugs and crime. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has hammered the Massachussetts governor repeatedly over a case in which convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple after failing to return from a furlough from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison. One of the victims of that crime have campaigned on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` been running away from his choice for vice president'' since the vice presidential debate last Wednesday, which polls and pundits judged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to have lost. `` Remember what he said,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, recalling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments before he selected <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate `` He said, ` Watch my vice presidential decision. That will tell all.' `` It sure does,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, you can try and run from that decision, but you ca n't hide it. And you ca n't run away from your own record of failure by exploiting a human tragedy for your own political ends.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in responding to the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case, cited examples of similar acts of violence committed by inmates freed from the federal prison system, from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison system when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was governor, and from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> halfway house that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has supported and praised. `` I do n't need any lectures from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on crime-fighting or on the sensitivity of compassion we must extend to the victims of crime,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I've been a chief executive on the front lines of fighting crime,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will not take responsibility for anything, I as chief executive took full responsibility for that tragic <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case and acted to change that policy, and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows it.'' He said that under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a police officer and school teacher were murdered by inmates on furlough. He added, `` Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Governor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took full responsibility.'' He said thousands of drug dealers are furloughed from federal prisons every year, and that he is seeking extradition of a convicted bank robber who was paroled from federal prison and is wanted to stand trial in the murder of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officer. In the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> case, he said one inmate raped and murdered a minister's wife after leaving the halfway house. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` even presented that halfway house with a presidential award _ after the tragedy occurred.'' `` So why are we being treated these last few days to a fresh assault on the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case by Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I think we know why. Because of his own pathetic record in the fight against crime and drugs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his mother spoke to a crowd of several thousand people inside a gym at <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The crowd at the school of 1,500 students was swelled by the college's annual parents' day. The college was where his mother, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> at age 9, graduated with honors in 1925. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father <PERSON> Panos </PERSON> attended the school for one year, in 1919, before transferring to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, offering her defense against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges, said her son `` is fighting a very, very difficult enemy, opponent. Unfortunately, this opponent tries everything possible. So far we have not answered very much.'' Her husband died in 1979, six years after the attack on him.

 Three emergency workers were hospitalized and several hundred people were evacuated from their homes when a fire at a swimming pool supply company created a cloud of chlorine gas, authorities said. The workers were released Saturday from <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and no serious injuries were reported in this desert resort, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>. The fire at <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> broke out Friday evening, and residents were asked to leave a 1-square-mile area, including <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> Regional Airport.

The government announced last month during its budget presentation that the nationwide jobless rate had reached 14 percent and was unlikely to fall much in the next year while its austerity programs were in place.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, temper rising as he recalled violence against his own family, accused <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday of `` shameless'' use of crime victims to win votes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touted a police endorsement but found himself sidetracked to another issue, denying he was running away from his running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, his choice for vice president, and said he was tired of `` erroneous reporting'' that he was trying to distance himself from the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the only one of the top four candidates off the campaign trail Saturday, and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, still basking in the glow of his apparent debate victory over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> last Wednesday, said, `` I'm beginning to wonder where is <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Did he leave a forwarding address when he left <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>?'' Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had kept quiet in recent weeks as Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> struck again and again at what he said was the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's `` revolving-door'' policy on weekend furloughs for dangerous criminals, lashed back on Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` exploiting a human tragedy for political ends,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech that aides said he wrote by hand the previous night after being told of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's latest efforts to win votes using the case of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a convicted murderer, failed to return from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough in 1986 and in early 1987 attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple after breaking into their house. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of `` astounding insensitivity'' toward crime victims, described the attack at length on Friday, and one of the victims, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to give campaign speeches and make radio ads for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, citing crimes against his father and brother, told his audience Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, `` I do n't need any lectures from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on crime fighting or on the sensitivity or compassion we must extend to the victims of crime. `` Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I've been a chief executive on the front lines of fighting crime. Unlike Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will not take responsibility for anything, I as chief executive took full responsibility for that tragic <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case and acted to change that policy, and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows it.'' `` So let's look at the facts and stop this shameless playing of politics with the tragedy of a crime.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his father was beaten, robbed and left bound at age 77 and that his brother <PERSON> Stelian </PERSON> was killed by a hit-and-run driver. The Democrat also said that when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a police officer and school teacher were murdered by inmates on furlough. And he said that under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the federal prison system `` has granted thousands of furloughs to drug pushers and drug traffickers.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in supporting a halfway house in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where one of the inmates left the house `` and raped and murdered a minister's wife.'' He was joined by his 85-year-old mother, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, who offered her own impassioned comments. She accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` mangling the truth, of trying to divide us,'' of suggesting that as the son of immigrants <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` does not love the flag quite as much,'' and of being behind letters sent to residents of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town saying her brothers were communists. `` Can anyone get this low?'' she asked. Earlier Saturday, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept his own focus on the law-and-order issue, accepting the endorsement of the head of the national Fraternal Order of Police. He made no mention of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during the event. Afterward, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was turning to leave but then came back to say heatedly that he was getting `` a little tired of erroneous reporting'' that has noted his relative lack of comment on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> since the debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` This concept that I see in some of these reports that I am not supportive of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are absolutely ludicrous,'' he said. `` They are ridiculous. He did well in that debate. He has my full support ... and I made a good decision'' in selecting the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as running mate. The police organization's president, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, said earlier that he was endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom he called `` the law enforcement candidate.'' A news release from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign touted the 197,000-person membership of the organization, but <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> acknowledged he was giving only his personal support, not that of the group, which has not taken a position. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign speeches have been emphasizing his stance that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is soft on crime, a point the vice president has tried to underscore with several public endorsements by law enforcement officials. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has responded with similar endorsements from other police groups. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Saturday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was trying to keep the focus on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` They have chosen a candidate that the imagemakers and the poll takers thought could be packaged and sold to the American people. That's supposed to be the very latest, the most productive of tactics by these imagemakers and it just did n't wash. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are not buying it. You have to have more substance there than that.'' Noting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` I think the best review I received on the debate was from the Oval Office itself, when they brought out the great communicator to try to bring about some kind of damage control.''

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> promised Saturday to make <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` face the music'' for choosing <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for the Republican ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, contending his debate with the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator Wednesday night was `` the turning point'' for the Democrats, said at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> news conference that `` the Republicans have now tried to turn the subject away from the debate, to not talk about <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' `` In fact, I'm beginning to wonder, where is <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Did he leave a forwarding address when he left <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was wrapping up a three-day swing through his home state on Saturday. Later in the day, making a quick trip to the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nation </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued to brag about his debate performance. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has a different perspective than he had last Wednesday night,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, with Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, stood waving on the tailgate of a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> van as he rode into <LOCATION> Shiprock </LOCATION> along a two and one-half mile parade route for the town's 65th annual fair. Tens of thousands of people were there for the parade, and some ran up to grab <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s hand when they found out who he was. He watched an Indian dance demonstration and met with tribal leaders. He told the crowd that the Democrats stood for more and better rural health, education and development programs, and that the Republicans had cut such programs back. The Democrats are hoping a strong vote from the reservations will help them win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in November. From <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to end his trip with a pair of appearances in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, on the far western end of the state. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may try to run away from his running mate, but he really ca n't hide,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said at his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> news conference. `` While the Republicans are running from the issues, and running from <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, we do n't intend to let them change the tune; we're going to see that they face the music,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been facing the music in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on the issues of crime and gun control in a barrage of Republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminals who wants to disarm honest citizens. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> attacked what he said were distortions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record, and said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would see through them. `` Texans wo n't buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man who wanted to sell Hawk missiles to the ayatollah,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> denied Republican assertions that the Democrats had given up on winning the South. `` That is obviously not true. It sounds like some of his comments during the debate. Not true at all,'' he said. `` I was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> the other day and they tell me we're ahead there I was in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, they said that's a dead heat. I think we're ahead in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. We've seen a nice improvement here in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -LRB- where -RRB- the momentum is back in our direction,'' he said, citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also discussed his relationship with the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, which some have questioned since <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that they were friends. He said that during the debate just before telling <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> he was `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said he was the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator's finance chairman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ran for president. He also said he received from <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> an inscribed copy of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, `` Profiles in Courage.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> invited him to his wedding, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, but he was already scheduled to make a speech in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and missed it. `` If I had known he was going to be president, I'd have gone,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 An estimated 20,000 Ukrainian-Americans marched from the shadow of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument to the Soviet Embassy to deliver an appeal to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for religious freedom in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The protesters, who walked the 2.7-mile route to the strains of a World War II Ukrainian freedom fighter's march, carried signs that said `` Free our Churches in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>.'' The group, led by a youth in a priest's robe carrying a gold and silver crucifix, was so large that the first part of the demonstration was leaving the embassy before the end left the pre-march rally site, police said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police estimated the crowd at 20,000. The march was one of several events this weekend in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> commemorating the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, where followers were baptized in the city of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in 988, according to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millennium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Futey </PERSON> In the letter for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> delivered to the embassy, the organization asked for legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox churches, which were outlawed by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Futey </PERSON> said his organization was demanding that the Soviets live up to the religious freedom tenets of the Soviet constitution and other international agreements. `` We are demanding the restoration, the opening of the Ukrainian Orthodox and <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches, as well as a stop to the harassing of our brethren, be they Baptist or Pentecostal,'' he said. `` Right now the people that practice the Catholic religion are put in jail, they have to practice clandestinely. They have to meet in the forest, in basements and at night,'' he said. He said there are about 50 million Ukrainians in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the majority _ 45 million _ living in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. At least 40 million of those in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> consider themselves members of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Futey </PERSON> said. The group also leveled a protest over what it termed `` the continuing destruction of <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> by Russification,'' in which Ukrainian history and culture is being appropriated as Russian to create a pretense of unification, he said.

 A new trade federation for education workers was created Saturday, making it the third independent union to be established in Communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since May, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency said 195 delegates attended the founding meeting on behalf of the 30,000 Hungarian teachers employed in higher education. According to its draft constitution, the new union is to be an independent, democratic organization so it can more effectively represent teaching professionals, the agency said. Delegates were reported to have criticized the `` hierarchic and bureaucratic character'' of former trade unions and poor pay and working conditions in the field. They also warned of the danger of underestimating teachers' scholarly work, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Filmmakers, television and video art workers earlier this month set up an independent <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> called MODESZ. The first independent union, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, was founded in May following widespread complaints about official unions' failure to prevent cuts in state subsidies for academic work.

 <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffield </PERSON>'s strangled body was found dumped in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1982. This year, the scattered remains of <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzette </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> were found in rural <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Some 1,700 miles and six years separates the slayings, but task forces in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are trying to determine whether an elusive murderer's path can be traced between them _ a path marked by up to 56 other deaths and disappearances. <PERSON> Coffield </PERSON>, 16, was the first victim linked to the so-called <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killer, who is officially blamed for the murders of 40 women in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. On Sept. 27, a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesperson said the department had identified Farmer, 22, and that her death was being investigated by a 10-member task force formed to investigate the killings and any possible link to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case. Police blame the disappearances of eight others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> on the same killer, who preyed mostly on prostitutes and transients until the slayings appeared to end in March 1984. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> task force is looking into the deaths of women, dating back to June 1985, whose bodies were dumped throughout the county and whose murders seem to fit the pattern of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings. Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> homicide unit, has said up to a dozen cases may be related. `` It's a possibility,'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said this summer. `` I would n't say it's remote But it has n't risen to a conclusive statement that there's a linkage.'' `` The lead detectives in this case believe the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer is responsible for some of the killings in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> detective told The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in August. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said two men arrested in connection with attacks on prostitutes are being investigated. No one contacted Saturday at either the sheriff's office or the police department knew about the status of the investigation. Similarities exist among the cases: _ Most victims were strangled, had backgrounds in prostitution or drug use and were transients _ Most of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> victims were found near an area called <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, which is dotted with motels and bars popular with prostitutes Most of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> victims were found near or along <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, an area much like the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> strip. _ In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, the killer dumped a number of his victims in wooded areas 30 to 40 miles from the city In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, many of the bodies were left on secondary roads within 75 miles of the city. _ The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> series appears to have ended in 1984, after police began heavy enforcement efforts against men patronizing prostitutes The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> series began in 1985. Self-described streetwalkers on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> say they are aware of the killings. `` The police let us know how many girls are missing or if one is found,'' said one woman, who identified herself as <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>, 18, from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. She said the police also have warned prostitutes to be careful of whom they solicit for business `` The fear's there,'' she added. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, it was n't until two years after <PERSON> Coffield </PERSON>'s body was found, and many killings later, that a task force was formed. King County Police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, believes a more concerted effort in the beginning could have ended the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> spree. `` If we knew back in' 82 -'83 what we know now, then all of these killings would n't have happened,''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> says an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price war is crowding it out of its No. 1 market _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Beginning this month, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> governments have offered extra price concessions to customers and moved to undercut non-cartel competitors, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Coupled with overproduction, the concessions `` have initiated an undeclared, intense competition in prices among countries in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> that decided to maintain or increase their market participation, searching for new clients and seeking to displace established commercial flows,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced price reductions for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had displaced <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' No. 1 oil supplier. It said production by the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> surpassed 20 billion barrels per day in August and September and blamed aggressive competition between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members for forcing the average price of Mexican crude on spot markets to about $ 9 a barrel. The monopoly said as a result of the changing marketplace for crude that it will earn less this year than the $ 7.9 billion generated by oil exports in 1987. But <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it will not increase its exports to compensate for lost earnings and risk aggravating an already volatile market. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is ready to -LRB- hold a -RRB- dialogue both with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members as well as independent exporters with the objective of achieving reasonable and stable prices for petroleum,'' the statement said. The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted an official with the Energy, Mines and <ORGANIZATION> State-Owned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had lost $ 2 billion in anticipated revenues so far in 1988 because of depressed market prices. The department oversees <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>'s operations Foreign exchange revenues generated by oil exports are essential to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to service its $ 104 billion foreign debt, second largest in the developing world behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the world's sixth-largest oil producer.

 A papyrus boat paddled by a six-member Greek crew set out Saturday from this <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> port to recreate a 10,000-year-old voyage to the island of Melos. A black-robed bishop chanted a 20-minute blessing and a band played music to begin the archaeological experiment to determine how Stone Age seafarers would have made the 94-mile trip. Several thousand people applauded as the 21-foot open boat, named <PERSON> Papyrela </PERSON> for the Greek word for papyrus and made of yellow papyrus stems lashed together with rope, slipped away from the dockside at sunset. The island-hopping voyage to <PERSON> Melos </PERSON> will take eight or nine days if the weather is favorable, said <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamounas </PERSON>, captain of the Papyrela. A <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel and a yacht will escort the boat, said <PERSON> Haris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzalas </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tradition </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the project.

American archaeologists found obsidian blades during excavations in the 1970s at the <LOCATION> Franchthi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cave </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. They belonged to Mesolithic cave dwellers and were dated to around 8,000 B.C. Boats made of papyrus, a kind of reed, also were used in ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from about 5,000 B.C.

<TEXT>
 A black teen-ager who claimed she was raped by six white men stood by her story Saturday and said she has `` evidence to back it up,'' despite a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grand jury's conclusion that she made the whole thing up `` This is no hoax. It's the ugly truth that some do n't want to deal with, but I have to live with it,'' <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, said during a news conference. A dazed Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found Nov. 28 in a garbage bag outside an apartment her family had recently vacated in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Her body was smeared with dog feces and marked with racial epithets. She said she had been held captive for four days and raped by several white men, including one who carried a police-type badge.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday urged <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to build a future based on the foundation of dignity, freedom and rights that transcend national boundaries. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, making his fourth trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and his 40th foreign trip as <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, spoke to the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> on the first day of his four-day visit to <LOCATION> Alsace-Lorraine </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In an airport arrival statement, the pontiff, speaking in French, said the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> views `` with satisfaction the efforts made by the European countries to tighten still more their bonds and forge a common future.'' In the past, the Polish-born pontiff has evoked the vision of a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals,'' based on a common Christian heritage. The pope expanded on this theme later Saturday and was expected to do so again when he speaks to the European Parliament on Tuesday. His message comes at a time of lively debate among the Common Market nations, which have agreed to fully integrate their economies in 1992. The commitment has touched off widespread discussion about whether <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should become a single political unit. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> provoked protests last month when she declared a U.S.-style European union would be `` highly damaging'' to the individual states. Speaking to the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the countries of the old continent should remember their common Christian heritage and apply it in policies governing family life, biotechnology, education and employment. `` The most urgent problem on which all nations should cooperate is access to work,'' he said. `` Is it utopian to ask that when decisions of an economic nature are made, there should be consideration of the trials of those who lose through unemployment a part of their dignity and sometimes even their strength to hope?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has called on her fellow leaders to concentrate on lowering commercial barriers and other practical steps, setting aside projects for Europe-wide social progress she described in a recent speech as utopian. In a wood-paneled room of the Palace of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the 68-year-old <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said that if <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` wishes to be true to itself, it must gather together all the forces of the continent, respecting the character of each region, but finding its roots in a common spirit.'' In the more intimate chamber at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, the pope referred to human rights as `` not just a catalogue of positive rights, but a body of underlying values'' that are `` the expression of the inalienable dignity of the human person.'' In the late afternoon, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Mass at <ORGANIZATION> Strasbourg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, arriving in the open popemobile despite the cool weather and periodic drizzle. In the evening, the pope spoke in French and German to a rally of 36,000 youngsters at the La Meinau Stadium in a <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> suburb. He spoke of understanding some of the issues facing youth today, including unemployment, sex and education. `` I respect your suffering. I am open to the questions it brings you up against. ... No doubt there are even greater, more widespread evils. The poor countries would tell you so,'' he said. The pope's visit was timed for his participation in the 2,000 th anniversary of <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> He also has scheduled visits to the dioceses of <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, all in the northeast near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is composed of 21 parliamentary democracies that make up nearly all of non-communist <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It aims to coordinate European legislation through a series of accords and to encourage unity, democracy and human rights. The Court of Human Rights has unusual power for an international judicial body, with the right to assign damages to the losing party in a case or to expel a country from the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It has condemned <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for its methods of interrogating terrorism subjects in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and ruled in favor of two sets of British parents in a case that resulted in the abolition of corporal punishment in English state schools. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and its judicial organs are not related to the European Economic Community, or Common Market.

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> snapped college football's longest losing streak of 44 games over nearly five years on Saturday by defeating <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> 16-13 <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s 2-yard scoring run with about five minutes left to play capped a 53-yard drive and followed a field goal that had given <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> a 13-9 lead. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbruzzese </PERSON> rushed for 182 yards as the <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> won for the first time in 47 games. The last time the <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> won was a 21-18 defeat of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 15, 1983. Since that game, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> had averted defeat only by tying <ORGANIZATION> Bucknell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> later in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> fans tore down both goal posts, smeared themselves with mud and exulted in the cold and damp. `` Wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehner </PERSON>, clutching his wet thermal mittens. `` It's wonderful. `` We've been waiting a long time.'' `` I'm feeling a little faint,'' agreed <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornara </PERSON>, a 1986 graduate who had never seen his team win. The anarchic <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> marching band joined the pileup on the field, complete with sousaphone, trumpets, flutes and drums. Band members massed outside the stadium later, chanting against <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and dangling from the open jaws of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s bronze lion statue. The victory came on <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s Homecoming Day, when stars of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s nationally ranked teams of the late 1940s were present to watch. `` They've got the monkey off their backs now,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON>, a 1949 graduate who played guard. `` It's like you're thirsty for a long time and all of a sudden you get something to drink. We've been out in the desert,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasprzak </PERSON>, a 1947 graduate who played quarterback. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>, a senior tackle on this year's team, said he watched in disbelief from the sidelines as <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>'s last-second, 49-yard field goal attempt fell short and wide. `` It's hard to believe that we actually achieved what we set out to do,'' <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> said. `` This almost makes up for all the rough times.''

 Crying children and bewildered neighbors stared at chalk outlines, debris and a dangling utility pole Saturday at the spot where five girls were killed when a speeding car jumped a sidewalk and struck them. The teen-age driver has diabetes, and authorities were checking reports that he may have suffered a seizure before the accident Friday night, said police Chief <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>. He said no alcohol was involved. Witnesses said the car was traveling at up to 70 mph. The driver and his sister, who was a passenger, were in critical condition Saturday at two <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> hospitals. <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION>, a village with about 1,875 residents, is about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` It's going to tear us apart. Everybody's just devastated. We knew these little girls,'' said <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 43, who used to babysit one of the victims. Witnesses told authorities the car sheared off the bottom of a utility pole, plowed into the five girls on a sidewalk and struck a tree. The police chief said evidence indicates the car was out of control for about 1,500 feet. `` This must have happened just incredibly fast for these kids not to get out of the way,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. He identified the victims as 13-year-olds <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylok </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeefry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokop </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Watia </PERSON>, 12. The driver, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcz </PERSON>, 17, is a distant relative of one of the victims, <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said. The dead girls were seventh - and eighth-graders at <ORGANIZATION> Glenbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> School officials are planning a memorial service at <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, and funerals were scheduled for Wednesday.

 Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> on Saturday said the government would allow the emergency importation of $ 200 million worth of food staples and other consumer goods. The $ 200 million will be used primarily to import meat, cooking oil, sugar and corn, whose prices have soared in recent weeks because of drought and inflation, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said in a nationally televised speech. Mikulic announced unspecified steps would be taken to protect declining standards of living and to motivate workers to work harder. But he also said he intended to continue with the basic tenets of his austerity program despite widespread protests in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> republic. By allowing these imports, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said he hoped to dampen inflationary pressure and demonstrate his determination to ease the nation's economic crisis. The announcment came while a joint session of the state presidency and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidium of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> republic convened in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION> to discuss the mass demonstrations that flared anew this week.

 <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> opened its doors 40 years ago this month with 107 students, and despite its tender age, the private four-year college today has 3,000 students who appear to believe youth is an asset. `` We have a lot more freedom in terms of policies because it does n't have a long tradition it's locked into,'' said senior <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomerantz </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who is student <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president. `` Its youth gives it an air of progressiveness. People recognize it's a place to really explore what you believe in,'' said <PERSON> Pomerantz </PERSON>. The Jewish founders of <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION> wanted to create a nonsectarian school in the tradition of such universities as <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and Notre Dame, whose origins were religious but whose mission was quality education. It was established at a time when some universities limited enrollment of Jews and other minorities. `` In 1948 a lot of top universities still had quota systems for Jews and Catholics, and blacks were hardly an issue then,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkowitz </PERSON>, spokesman for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't have the same kinds of needs'' for unbiased admission, <PERSON> Merkowitz </PERSON> said. `` But the availability of institutions like that is important in educational diversity.'' Today, the student body is estimated to be about 65 percent Jewish. Thirteen percent are black, Hispanic and Asian. `` A place of excellence, that's why <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> was founded. There were quotas against Jews, but there was a need beyond that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Handler </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> was a maverick from the start. Only two of its seven founding trustees had been to college. The school lacked a single large endowment but instead built itself on many small donations. The university is among the most expensive private colleges at $ 20,000 for tuition, room and board. The school was named for the late <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandeis </PERSON>. A liberal jurist and the first Jew on the high court when he was appointed in 1916, he died in 1941. The small liberal arts university on the grounds of a defunct medical school 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> soon attracted to its faculty such luminaries as <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. It began turning out such graduates as the future Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-NY </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Herskovitz </PERSON>, the producer of the award-winning TV show, `` thirtysomething.'' `` There was a cerain audacity to the whole thing,'' said Professor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, who teaches American civilization and politics and has been at <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION> since 1952, serving in a variety of administrative posts. `` It had such phenomenal, mercurial success. No institution assembled a faculty of national and international standing so quickly,'' <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said. The question of <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION>' Jewish identity remains an unsettled one, however. When a student newspaper three years ago praised the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, other students stormed its offices and labeled its staff _ one-third Jewish _ anti-Semitic. Just this past April, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> students who observe religious dietary laws protested when the student cafeteria began serving pork and shellfish. A counterprotest by students accused the protesters of hostility toward non-Jews on the campus.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was given another blood transfusion Saturday, as his son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, expressed concern over the number of events canceled out of respect for the ill monarch. For the second day, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> showed no outward signs of the hemorrhaging that caused him to vomit blood 20 days ago, imperial officials said. But doctors said the 87-year-old emperor received another transfusion because they believe the bleeding has not stopped. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's oldest living monarch, now has received a total of 13 pints of blood since his condition worsened. <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> quoted doctors as saying a new antibiotic apparently has helped reduce the emperor's slight fever, which they believe is caused by an inflammation of his bile duct. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said the emperor's condition was stable and his jaundice `` had not progressed rapidly.'' News reports have said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer, but palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied the reports. In separate meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Grand Steward <PERSON> Shoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujimori </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, heir to the throne, said his father would be displeased about the scores of events being canceled in deference to his illness, officials said. `` We appreciate the people's warm consideration very much, but if it affects their daily lives, I'm afraid it would not make the emperor happy,'' <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> was quoted as telling <PERSON> Fujimori </PERSON>. Events, including sports festivals, concerts, overseas trips by government officials and visits by foreign dignitaries, have been canceled since the emperor fell ill. The emperor was considered a living god until he renounced his divinity after World War II. Under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar constitution he became a symbol of the state with no real political power.

 The space shuttle Discovery arrived home atop a jumbo jet Saturday, five days after completing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first manned space mission since the Challenger tragedy. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, with the shuttle bolted on its back, descended through a cloud deck and glided to a runway touchdown at 7:04 p.m. EDT as darkness descended on the Kennedy Space Center. The return flight began Saturday morning at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Because the Kennedy runway is not heavily lighted and because of cloudy weather, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials were considering diverting the shuttle aircraft to <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for an overnight stay But half an hour before landing an advance plane reported conditions favorable, and the jumbo jet came on in. Thousands of spectators turned out to applaud the return, lining roads and river banks and creating huge traffic jams at the space center. Most of them were among the hundreds of thousands who were here to cheer Discovery's departure on Sept. 29. Technicians planned to remove the shuttle from its carrier plane overnight and tomorrow, and then tow it to a processing facility to prepare it for its next flight. Officials reported it returned from space in such good shape that little refurbishment work will be needed. The shuttle-jet combination made the three-hour run after a refueling stop at <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s modified <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 took off from <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> military base at 10:54 a.m. EDT with the shuttle bolted to its back, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a fitting finish to a super mission,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said. `` It was the prettiest take-off from -LRB- <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> -RRB- that I've ever seen. And I've seen them all. It was as graceful as the landing.'' The flight from <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> was uneventful, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Algranti </PERSON>, pilot of 747. `` We had real good weather all the way, with a little bit of tail wind,'' he said. `` We are glad to be back in business.'' Discovery and its five-man crew landed on the hard clay <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> bed at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> last Monday, four days after its launch from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. More than 400,000 people came to cheer the returning astronauts It was the first shuttle flight since Challenger blew up during liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members. The highlight of Discovery's flight was the successful deployment of a $ 100 million Tracking and Data Relay communications satellite, a twin of a satellite destroyed aboard Challenger. The next shuttle mission will be flown by <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, which will carry a classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload when it is launched in late November. Discovery's next flight, scheduled for Feb. 18, will deploy another <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> satellite for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> communications. When Discovery landed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, reporters asked <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space flight, if the shuttle and its jet carrier could take a more circuitous route to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> so it could be seen by more Americans. `` I wish we could fly it around, but that's not its purpose,'' Truly replied. `` It's purpose is to get back to the cape and to get back into space where it belongs.'' Discovery was prepared for its return to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> technicians who photographed and replaced damaged heat-shield tiles, purged fuel from its main engines and orbital maneuvering engines, installed a tailcone and locks to prevent control surfaces from fluttering during the flight, then hoisted it atop the 747. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> bought the 225-foot-long jumbo jet from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 15 million in 1974 and at first used it for flight research projects. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> modified the jet for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 so it could carry the shuttles. The 747 was reinforced and its engines were upgraded to increase takeoff thrust. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> recently purchased a second 747 to ferry shuttles cross-country. Once it is modified, the second jet will be based in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was quoted as saying Saturday his policy in handling the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied lands was to cause casualties among Arab rioters. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s statement came as parts of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were paralyzed by a strike to protest the shooting deaths of four Palestinians by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Arab and hospital reports said two more Palestinians died Saturday after clashes with soldiers. `` In confrontation, the rioters should suffer casualties and scars, so that they know it would not end with detentions. This is my policy and I'm responsible for it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying. Dozens of black mourning flags flew from rooftops in curfewed <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION>, where the four were shot Friday. Clashes flared Saturday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said troops shot and killed one Palestinian and wounded 18 others. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television quoted <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources as saying as many as 30 Palestinians were wounded. The army command confirmed the 18 casualties but said the death was caused by a local feud. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, 23-year-old <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kader </PERSON> from the nearby <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> refugee camp died Saturday of a head wound suffered during a Sept. 26 demonstration, officials said. <PERSON> Kader </PERSON>'s funeral procession sparked a riot in the curfewed camp, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops opened fire on mourners who unfurled outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, wounding seven people, an Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said. The army command confirmed the casulaties. The army imposed a curfew on about 120,000 Palestinians in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the neighboring refugee camps after violent clashes Friday. In those incidents, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said four Arabs were killed and 21 wounded, but the army Saturday confirmed only two deaths and 14 wounded. `` We know that other people have perished, but we do n't know the circumstances,'' a military spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' streets were deserted except for army patrols. At one point, demonstrators violated the curfew and threw stones at soldiers, an Arab reporter said. The army said three Palestinians were wounded in the clash. Around the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, Palestinians staged a strike in solidarity with <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents. Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at the troops, who in response shot and wounded four people, the military command said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yabad </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelani </PERSON>, 28, died after being shot in the chest Saturday, hospital officials said. Circumstances of the death were not immediately clear. The army said it was apparently caused by a feud between villagers, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said soldiers shot <PERSON> Kelani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said several shots were fired during a fistfight between rival families but said an army patrol was attacked when it entered the village to separate the foes. Saturday's fatalities raised to 291 the number of Palestinians killed since the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died in clashes during the same period. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army clamped a curfew on five towns and refugee camps, affecting at least 100,000 people. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> clashes, four Palestinians were wounded, the army said. The radio quoted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded and 18,000 detained since the uprising began. Of them, some 5,600 are still in jail, with about 2,000 serving sentences of up to six months without trial. In spite of the high number of casualties and detentions, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was quoted as saying, the army still failed to achieve its goal of `` restoring quiet and maintaining Israeli control'' in the occupied territories. The radio was banned from broadcasting <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s voice following a law forbidding it to air voices of candidates competing in the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> runs for the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Also Saturday, authorities detained five ultra-Orthodox Jews during a religious riot during which stones were thrown at passing cars and police in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhood, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. They were protesting what they view as violations of the Jewish Sabbath, the biblically mandated day of rest which lasts from sundown Friday till sundown Saturday. Jewish law forbids any work, including driving, on <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s oldest town was alive Saturday with tales of monkey kings and devil imps at a 16-year-old storytelling festival that has helped revive national interest in the ancient folk art. Tellers from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> entertained about 5,000 people under large, striped tents set up on hillsides, along a creek and near railroad tracks downtown. `` Aaaaargh'' screeched <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> as she became an angry monkey king. The monkey was pulled down to the underworld but saved from death in `` the great wok'' by eating forbidden peaches that made him immortal. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> teller of tales from the Orient was among 15 featured yarn-spinners, including folk singer <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, picked a handmade, 35-year-old banjo as he sang of a coal miner's rebellion and the plight of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. `` This festival is redefining storytelling and bringing it back to life,'' <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> said. `` I'm just an amateur. I'm having a wonderful time listening to these expert storytellers.'' The three-day National Storytelling Festival is sponsored each year by a <ORGANIZATION> Jonesborough </ORGANIZATION> group with a mouthful of a name _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> and Perpetuation of Storytelling. The festival is bigger every year and a sixth tent was added this year to accommodate crowds that spilled under rolled-up tent flaps into the sun. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON>, from Granite Quarry, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, had children in stitches when she added her own brand of humor to the classic tale of the selling of a soul to the devil. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, a not-so-bright poor man with only a skinny cow to sell, runs into the devil dressed in black and sitting on a rock. He sells the cow to the devil for a bottomless purse of gold, but he pays later when he dies and is put in charge of the devil's 100 million caged imps. Amateur tellers tried their luck in the center of a small circle of hay bales called `` The Swappin' Ground.'' Among those who got up to tell was 9-year-old <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaefer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dexter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who spun one about a dragon. `` I've got to make it a little bit slower,'' he said after he was done. `` It's fun. I like telling stories. It's my way of having fun.'' <PERSON> Jym </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said he traveled to <LOCATION> Jonesborough </LOCATION> for his second year of tip-gathering among the masters. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> is a college professor, campus pastor and storyteller in a state with no such festival, although similar events are cropping up across the country. `` I come to see master tellers demonstrate how you do it well,'' he said. `` I always find new inspiration. They serve as mentors rather than sources of information for stories.''

 A retired airline pilot was killed Saturday when the vintage combat plane he was flying crashed minutes after making a pass before an air show crowd of 20,000, officials said. No other injuries were reported. Authorities said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, whose age was unavailable, was killed when the twin-engine <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> A-20 Havack Attack Bomber, believed to be the last of its kind, crashed about 2:45 p.m. in a cornfield about five miles south of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. Few people saw the crash because <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> had already flown past the crowd at the Valley International Airport and was about three miles away, said <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an international group of pilots and air-show buffs who owned the craft. The Havack Attack bomber was a fairly small workhorse used by American, Australian and British forces during the early stages of World War II, <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> police dispatcher <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said witnesses reported seeing the plane `` flip over, do a nose dive, then hit the ground.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> also said witnesses told police the plane lost power in one engine before crashing.

 A man was sentenced to three years in prison after causing `` serious health damage'' for knowingly spreading the AIDS virus, a newspaper reported Saturday. The unnamed defendant, suspecting venereal disease, tested positive for AIDS when he sought medical help two years ago, the <PERSON> Lidova </PERSON> <PERSON> Demokracie </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- newspaper reported. The man was instructed to limit his sexual contact to one partner and to use a condom. `` Several dozen witnesses, two of whom carry the virus, testified in the case,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> daily, which is sanctioned by the communist government. The paper said it was the first such case of its type in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The verdict is subject to an appeal. A positive test indicates presence of AIDS antibodies but does not mean the person has the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The immune-stripping virus can be spread through sexual contact. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has 100 registered AIDS virus carriers, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported last month.

 Learning on the job once meant learning how to do the work, but some <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> companies are changing the rules to give themselves an edge and their employees an education. There are about 400,000 illiterate adults in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and approximately 650,000 adults without a high school diploma, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleich </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>. Some state employers have found that the lack of education among their workers is a drag on productivity. `` We had a lot of people out there that did n't finish high school,'' said <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, personnel administrator at the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Instruments plant in <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>. `` You're demanding more from your people. They could n't cope with it. They could n't handle it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> tested the 800 people at the plant two years ago, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, and found 200 did n't have a high school education. Of those, six could not read or write. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> arranged for an instructor to use a classroom in the plant to teach classes for General Educational Development diplomas. The state paid for the instructor, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, while the company provided some materials and the classroom. Students paid the $ 15 class fee. At first, classes were just for employees, but now they are open to the public. `` What we've found is, we end up with a person who has a much higher self-esteem ... and they become a better employee because they're willing to speak out better than they were before. ... It's done a lot for the confidence of the people `` It's for the individual themselves, basically. ... But we get a benefit from it. We're not that holy. I did n't think it would make a difference, but it does. It makes a big difference.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s program was a model for a similar one at <ORGANIZATION> Fuller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>. `` I'm excited to no end'' about job-site education, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> president <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Deem </PERSON> said during a recent interview. With help from April <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pendleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and a literacy volunteer, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> offered GED and literacy classes at the plant this year. Of 158 employees, about 30 signed up for both classes, Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, and 11 have so far received their GEDs. Deem said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> paid for all materials, class and test fees, which totaled about $ 4,000. He also said the employees who got their GEDs would receive a pay increase. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spegal </PERSON>, a high school dropout and assistant foreman at the plant, said he would have taken the course without a bonus incentive. `` I would say that ... when we first started going there was no talk of a bonus, so I guess we all would've,'' <PERSON> Spegal </PERSON> said. Deem said the difference was phenomenal. `` The return on the investment has been one of the best things I've ever done in my life,'' he said. `` We would have had to demote these people back to janitorial services because of the quality program we're putting in. ... How can we further the -LRB- job -RRB- education unless they can read and write and do some basic math?'' Even those who have n't yet graduated `` are moving up so much in the plant, they're making money for us,'' Deem said. <PERSON> Spegal </PERSON>, 29, said he is thinking about attending <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not really sure ... how far I want to go. But I've got the rest of my life to do it.''

 Despite the anti-tax rhetoric of the presidential candidates, the nation's business leaders seem prepared to accept a tax increase as part of a plan to shrink the budget deficit. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has flatly promised never to raise taxes, while Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would turn to taxes only as a last resort. But some of the executives of the country's largest companies, attending a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, said they were willing to back off from their traditional opposition to tax increases. `` In our private conversations, I find in general people say, ` I'd be willing to come up with some reasonable approach to additional taxes, maybe dollar for dollar with real savings -LRB- in deficit reduction -RRB-,''' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The council finished its twice-a-year, two-day conference at this resort town in the mountains of western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> by hearing from former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. The two are co-chairmen of a high-level government commission scheduled in December to deliver a deficit-cutting plan to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the next president. `` I think the business community is very concerned about the deficit. I further think they're satisfied there should be a spending cut and @ or a tax increase or some combination of both _ so long as it does n't affect their business,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is also a member of the council. He said his commission's job is `` 20 percent economics and 80 percent ... trying to establish a willingness ... to share the misery.'' Council sessions are closed to non-members, but executives and speakers talked with reporters afterward. Most of the business leaders prefer a tax increase, if there is one, aimed at curbing consumption and encouraging saving rather than a tax on business. `` Taxes that slow up the economy and reduce our ability to compete are bad for the long-term interests of the country,'' said <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a health care company. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank, argued that a tax on consumption would benefit consumers. `` If we do the right job with the fiscal deficit, we'll get the payback in a relaxation on the monetary side so that you could see a significant reduction in interest rates,'' he said. A dissenting view was offered by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wriston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s predecessor at <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> In the text of a speech to the council, he argued that the deficit was inflated by outdated government accounting procedures that treat long-range capital spending the same as operating expenses and by the failure to take state government surpluses into account. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit was not severe compared with other Western nations and had not caused the economic ills for which it is blamed. Although <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> stressed that the commission had made no decisions yet, he said any tax increase likely would have to be coupled with an assurance that the money would be used to reduce the deficit. He said any consumption tax would clearly have to have a provision to exempt poor people. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the next president will have a difficult time convincing the public that it is necessary to reduce the deficit because neither presidential candidate is addressing the issue in the campaign `` The next president is going to need a lot of help. ... Business leaders have to be at the forefront of trying to help him,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Strauss-Lewis commission, was particularly critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for boxing himself in politically with the no-tax pledge He also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for a flexible spending freeze was `` fiscal frozen fruitcake.''

 Opposition plans to create a `` grand coalition government'' next year face a strong challenge from the left and from pro-government forces claiming a hidden victory in President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat. `` It's going to be very, very hard,'' <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, director of Latin American studies at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said in an interview Saturday. The coalition must realize that next year's open election `` is not in the bag,'' said <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, a Chilean who came home to monitor last week's vote on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. He said the coalition of 16 opposition parties from the center-right to Socialist left that campaigned for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat must avoid overconfidence <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost by more than 800,000 votes in Wednesday's yes-or-no referendum on whether to extend his 15-year rule to 1997 According to the 1980 constitution, he remains president for 16 more months. The winner of elections planned for December 1989 is to assume power in March 1990. The opposition coalition's secretary-general, <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrigada </PERSON>, said he is not worried that the opposition will fall apart, despite the country's tradition for splitting into what Chileans call `` the three thirds:'' right, center and left. Most previous presidential elections had three major candidates, one from each camp. `` If we are going to have three thirds, it's not important if there is respect and understanding,'' he said. But he said the coalition plans to pursue `` a grand coalition government'' after pressing for constitutional changes to speed the election and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s departure from power. `` There's a chore for each day,'' he said. `` Right now, what we have to do is change the constitution with the armed forces.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, who seized power in a 1973 coup, has vowed to remain in office until his term runs out. The powerful army he commands has shown no willingness to bargain with politicians. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a prominent moderate Socialist, recognize that any negotiations with the military could take time. `` The people are mature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship do n't end in 15 hours,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. `` If we remain united, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> can do nothing. That's the only important thing right now. `` Consensus will be relatively easy,'' he said. `` There are n't that many leaders It seems to me we have to find a man or woman who represents everyone'' to run in the election. Most observers believe the consensus candidate will be <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a 67-year-old law professor and veteran politician generally considered acceptable to both the moderate right and left. But leaders of the radical <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> alliance on Saturday called for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s immediate resignation and were expected to disregard moderates' appeals for patience. Since Wednesday's referendum, <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, 52, has been barraged by supporters asking if he will run as the candidate of the left. On Friday, he declared: `` I'm not a candidate. I'm not the most appropriate person.'' The government and rightist groups are clearly hoping for an opposition split that could win them the election. Experts disagree over whether the constitution allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself to be a candidate, but his interior minister, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, said the loss Wednesday actually represented a kind of political victory. Slightly more than 3.1 million people cast `` yes'' ballots Wednesday, compared to more than 3.8 million `` no'' votes. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the `` no'' votes `` have to be divided by 16,'' the number of parties in the opposition coalition, while <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> alone can claim the `` yes'' votes. `` There is no greater political force than President <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s support,'' he said `` The opposition's support could be numerically more -LRB- than the one the government received -RRB- but it is not homogeneous,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said Saturday night in a 12-minute nationwide radio-and-television broadcast. `` We in the government are unified in all that is essential, and it makes us stronger.'' Conservative civilian politicians also have expressed the desire to take the support for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and turn it into a victory for the right in an open election. If more than two candidates run and neither wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the constitution calls for a runoff between the two highest vote-getters. <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> said he was certain that if the opposition splits and the runoff features a rightist and a leftist candidate, the right would win. He said Chileans `` would be afraid that a leftist government would lead to another coup. And they'll choose anything before another coup.''

<TEXT>
 A man accused of raping, knifing and shooting three teen-age runaways was found guilty Saturday of murdering one of them. A <ORGANIZATION> Kitsap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> guilty of aggravated first-degree murder and other charges in the attack last year. The same jury now will hear more testimony before deciding between a death sentence or life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, 33, a tattoo artist from nearby <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, was accused of taking the boy and two girls he picked up Sept. 17, 1987, to an isolated area, raping them at gunpoint, and tying them up. <PERSON> Bunnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 13, was shot in the head during the attack and died two months later. The other girl, 15, and the boy, 13, survived. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> was also found guilty of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree rape. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the mother of the murdered girl, smiled, cried and hugged a supporter when the verdict was read. The 15-year-old girl, who survived gunshots and a slashed throat, also was in the courtroom for the verdict. In closing arguments Friday, <LOCATION> Kitsap </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> pointed at <LOCATION> Yates </LOCATION> and said, `` The state has presented to you an ugly, violent picture with that man at the core.'' The isolated area where <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> took the three had `` no houses, no lights, no traffic _ perfect place to rape and murder,'' <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> raped the teens at gunpoint and tied them up, and while binding them he had time to premeditate murder, <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> said. The death penalty can be given only when murder is premeditated. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> raped a girl, tied her up, then shot her in the eye and ear, but she remained conscious and watched as <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> sodomized a boy, <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> said. After the assailant left she freed herself and ran barefoot down the gravel road to get help, the prosecutor said. `` Who should she run into but the defendant?'' <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> said. `` This nightmare should n't happen to anybody.'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> slit the girl's throat in the second encounter, but `` he's still not done,'' <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> said `` He strangles her, smashes her face into the ground.'' The girl played dead to make <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> leave, he said. The defense maintained that <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> attacked the children only after one of the girls consented to have sex with him, and the three then threatened to double-cross him for money. `` I am not denying to you _ <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> is not denying to you _ that he cut, choked, shot and strangled'' the teens, defense attorney <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON> told jurors. But `` there are different versions of these events,'' she added. The three teens are from <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, across Puget Sound from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Protection For Government Whistle Blowers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation to provide better protection for government employees who report waste or fraud in their agencies won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval on Saturday and was sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Under the bill, approved earlier in the week by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, government whistle blowers who feel they have been unfairly treated would be allowed to appeal their cases directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an independent body set up to review personnel actions. Supporters said the legislation was needed because the Office of Special Counsel, established to represent whistle blowers, was not doing its job. The bill also would make it easier for employees to prove improper retaliation by simplifying the elements of proof and increasing the burden on an agency to justify its actions. The legislation will `` send a clear signal that retaliation against whistle-blowers will not be tolerated'' in the federal government, said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., who sponsored the bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` If we are going to achieve a more honest and efficient government, it is essential that we restore confidence in federal employees that their government will respond in a fair and ethical manner whenever they disclose wrongdoing,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said in a statement. The bill won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval on a voice vote as the chamber met past midnight early Saturday, working to complete action on numerous bills before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for the national elections. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would sign the bill into law.

 A troubled reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> wo n't resume producing nuclear weapons material until engineers are sure longtime safety problems have been corrected, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday. `` I think we are all disturbed by what we have seen,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, one of two <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bodies investigating the sprawling facility near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant energy secretary for safety, health and quality assurance, also has started a new review of events at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, said department spokeswoman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>. Plant managers have been rocked over the past week by disclosure that up to 30 significant mishaps occurred at the facility over the past three decades, and that many had not been reported to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters or disclosed to the public. All three reactors at the plant have been shut down since August when a mishap idled the P-Reactor. Spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> said the department will not restart the reactor `` until we are completely satisfied with all the safety procedures.'' <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said Friday the department had set a Nov. 1 target date for restarting the P-Reactor, but <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> said Saturday that <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> was in error and that no timetable has been set. The plant produces two materials used in nuclear weapons, plutonium, which the government has in adequate supply, and tritium, which decays more quickly. Officials say the amount of tritium on hand and the date by which they must resume production are classified. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in its Sunday editions, said senior administration officials believe the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> reactors may be out of service so long the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might have to start deactivating nuclear warheads to recover radioactive elements for use in higher priority weapons. It said the primary concern was the supply of tritium. `` It is very important that we restore the reactors to safe operation soon,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, the top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official for atomic energy matters. `` If we do n't, there will be very serious consequences for our ability to maintain our nuclear deterrent.'' <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> also had said that if the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> can not resume production in time, the department might restart the N-Reactor at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in order to quarantee an adequate supply of tritium. <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON>, however, said it would take at least 18 months to restart the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reactor. Officials are not contemplating that option, he said. Concern has been mounting within the government over procedures at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, which is operated by E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> under contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have been trying to change the mind-set,'' <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said. `` We have been enhancing procedures as part of a long-term effort.'' The P-Reactor was closed after a mishap caused, in part, by a miscalculation of xenon and tritium levels and involving an unorthodox method to manipulate control rods, according to an internal report released Thursday. No date has been set for restarting the other two reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which were shut down for long-term maintenance. <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> said his committee, which was established as an independent board to advise <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, has noticed some changes in reporting procedures at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but still has concerns. `` From what we have seen, it seems that there has grown up a sense of complacency -LRB- at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> -RRB- which is a dangerous attitude when dealing with nuclear reactors,'' he said in a telephone interview. The independent committee, formed in March, began reviewing operations at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> even before four senators this week urged an investigation, said <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` So far, what we have is a series of serious events,'' he said. `` We are not yet prepared to conclude whether these are individual things which need fixing or whether there is a pattern that means something more serious needs fixing.'' The committee will discuss its preliminary findings at an open meeting Wednesday and Thursday in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and is due to deliver a report to the energy secretary and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 1, said <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>. Another independent report, prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> NUS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a private consulting firm in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, cited 558 forced reactor shutdowns at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from 1971 through 1987, of which 51 percent were caused by equipment failure, 26 percent by personnel failure, 10 percent by `` degradation of essential services,'' 10 percent by `` process difficulty,'' and 3 percent by procedure deficiency. The report also recorded seven off-site radioactive releases from 1975 through 1987 exceeding standards at the plant. The most serious appeared to be the release of 600,000 gallons of contaminated water on Oct. 25, 1977. The most recent was a tank overflow in February 1987 in which tritium was released into the atmosphere.

 A communist rebel leader was captured Saturday by security forces in a raid on a suburban <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> hideout, the military's general headquarters announced. Military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> identified the rebel as <PERSON> Luisito </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in charge of operations in the central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> region north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> described de la <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> as a `` top-ranking'' regional rebel leader who authorities had offered a $ 3,500 reward for his capture. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said de la <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, caught before dawn in a home in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, was undergoing interrogation at the Camp Aguinaldo general headquarters. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> had been underground for more than a decade. Military officials said de la <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> joined the banned party in 1976 after helping organize the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>, a breakaway faction of the rebel-backed Patriotic Youth, one of the offshoots of the Communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The Communists have been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state. The Front is an umbrella organization of 12 groups believed controlled by the Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In a related development, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Adalem </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said the military hoped to raise up to 1 million reservists this year to `` meet any national emergency,'' including <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels and right-wing extremists. <PERSON> Adalem </PERSON> said the reservists would be in addition to the 80,000 men expected to join a new paramilitary group, the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, which will be deployed in rural areas by the year's end. The Unit, or CAFGU, is to replace other anti-Communist vigilante and paramilitary organizations that have been accused of widespread human rights abuses against civilians.

 The General Accounting office is investigating possible organized crime involvement in savings and loans failures across the country, a newspaper reported Saturday. Sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the primary investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> an investigation should be completed by January. The newspaper did not identify the sources. The newspaper also said a congressional committee would probably begin hearings on the matter after the report is completed.

<HEAD>Stars Stump for the Democratic Ticket</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> celebrities sought to add star quality to the Democratic presidential campaign of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Saturday as their `` Star Spangled Caravan'' began a barnstorming tour of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. `` Any bit of enthusiasm on the campaign would be to all of our advantage,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, who portrays the affable father on television's `` Family Ties.'' About 35 actors appeared before about 800 students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> to campaign for the Democratic ticket and to urge people to register to vote in November's general election. Saturday was the last day to register in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and about 200 students signed up as Democrats, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, press secretary for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in the state. Gross drew the loudest response when he commented on Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quyale </PERSON>'s vice presidential debate answer that he would first say a prayer if thrust into the presidency. `` I can guarantee there would be a lot of other Americans on their knees, people who have never cast a prayer in their lives,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. The caravan, organized by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, husband of actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, also planned stops in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The three <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states have 64 votes in the electoral college, nearly one-quarter of those needed to elect a president, <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` The stakes in this election are very huge. We're at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era, and the people in these states can pick the next president,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> before the group departed. `` Voter registration in a close race can make an election. We hope by the caravan, we will bring it to their attention.'' For some on the tour, which included <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, it was a new experience. `` I've never been politically active before,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Larroqette </PERSON> of the television show `` Night Court.'' <PERSON> Larroqette </PERSON> said he wrote in singer-singwriter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> for president in the 1980 election. Gross defined the group with a term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has used to disparage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` As a group, we are probably more liberal than the national average,'' he said amidst an autograph-seeking crowd that followed the celebrities to voter registration tables at the campus rally. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, star of the 1960s television series `` Sea Hunt,'' stressed environmental issues in supporting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I like pure clean water to dive in,'' he quipped. `` The environment is very important, but not enough is being done about it.''

<HEAD>Consumers' Group Says: Chicago's Electric Rates Highest in Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Electricity customers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are paying the highest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this fall, a utility watchdog group said. A <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> study concluded electric rates charged by <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are increasing an average 62 percent as rates are converted from summer to winter scales this month. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> serves <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and much of northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The increase, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in June, means that a typical monthly residential bill will be $ 58.58, according to the study. After <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the next most expensive <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities for non-summer electric rates were <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, with an average of $ 52.57, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at $ 49.66, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> at $ 45.39 and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> at $ 41.39, the study said. An <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> spokesman said the study results are misleading, because a 13 percent reduction in summer rates is not considered. The study figures were based on an estimate of 400 kilowatt hours per month by a single-family or two-family building that does not have electric heat. `` They're not giving us credit for the rate reduction that was in effect during the hottest summer in history. People paid substantially less than they would have if the old rates were in effect,'' said <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved the 62 percent jump in winter rates as an emergency measure to reduce the difference between summer and winter bills.
