 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has `` walked away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream'' with policies to help the rich at the expense of working people. `` I'm running for president because during the past seven years I've seen too many people thrown out into the streets after decades on the job. ... I've talked to too many local leaders who've seen their communities become ghost towns of boarded up hopes and foreclosed dreams,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. His speech at Serb Hall, a traditional rallying spot for presidential hopefuls in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, came with polls suggesting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is in a virtual dead heat with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> heading into Tuesday's primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been making a strong pitch in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to blue-collar workers, asking them to support him as he supported striking meatpackers and paperworkers as well as <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> autoworkers about to lose their jobs because of a plant closing. While hitting hard at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refrained from criticizing other Democratic candidates. One day earlier, he had spoken in general terms of his differences with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and then had criticized <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> for demanding he be more specific. At a news conference after the speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, responding to questions, said he felt he was better qualified than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to be president because of his experience as a governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But he stopped well short of criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also called for the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Asked why he felt he was better qualified than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I think I am going to be a better president because I think I have the strength, the experience and the values to lead this country, because I am somebody who not only believes in good jobs and good wages for people, I've helped to create them.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reserved his criticism for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. `` This administration has walked away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday. `` They've walked away from the basic contract that says if you work hard and pay your taxes and live within the law, you have a right to a good job; and the right to a life where you do n't have to go to bed every night worried about whether that job will still be there in the morning.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has done nothing to move people from welfare to jobs, to fight adult illiteracy, to preserve good-paying jobs or to provide adequate health care to the needy. He said he is running for president `` because I believe that every American should have a house _ not a slab of concrete or a heating grate _ that they can call home.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also promised what he called a real war on drug and alcohol dependency and asked, `` How can we tell our children to say no to drugs when this administration ca n't say no to one of the largest drug peddlers in this hemisphere?'' _ an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> defended his criticism of rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Thursday and took issue with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being `` afraid to say a single word about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' Later, he called for the removal of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. At a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fundraiser, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the attorney general should step down because it is `` time to remove the cloud over the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` How long will it take this administration to understand the importance of integrity in government?'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> asked a crowd at the posh Grove Isle resort. `` We can not tolerate a situation where the nation's chief law enforcement officer is constantly testifying as a suspect before grand juries, constantly operating under a cloud of suspicion.'' The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator pointed to the departure of top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and reports that they had quit because they believed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was hurting the department by staying on. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> say, ` Oh, it's no bid deal. There are resignations all the time.' What insensitivity! What contempt for the American people!'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign raised about $ 108,000 at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> event, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, one of the organizers. Earlier, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> commented after a Capitol Hill celebration marking his 40th birthday, an event that came as a relief to the candidate who has grown weary of answering questions about running for president while still in his 30s. `` Forty makes all the difference,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> reacted to questions at a news conference about his remarks on Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, when he criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as without experience and said he was dismayed by the candidate's associations with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said that by his criticism he was holding <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the civil rights activist, to the same standard as other candidates. `` I've said exactly the same thing I've said over the last year, and all of a sudden it's a big deal,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` Well, the only reason it seems to some people like a big deal is that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is afraid to say a single word about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, began cautiously speaking of differences between himself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and domestic policy on Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` from time to time differences will arise ... and those will come out over time.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have won the most Democratic delegates so far, with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in third place. The <LOCATION> Tennesse </LOCATION> senator spoke to reporters in the sunshine in front of the Capitol after joining in a birthday celebration in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office building. `` You know, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> was perpetually 39,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I've been doing a kind of reverse <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> in this campaign _ I've been trying to turn 40 <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> planned to spend the next four days campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> before Tuesday's primary there. His campaign began airing a new television ad in that state attacking <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> for closing the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> It shows <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stating that <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> was paid $ 20 million in 1986. `` I'll make these corporations pay their share of the taxes and create jobs here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in the ad. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was asked about his criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a day after his rival said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s comments amounted to a personal attack and canceled a meeting between the two. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> called that characterization ridiculous, and he faulted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for what he termed a `` ludicrous'' hesitancy to engage <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in debate or criticism. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is still trying to restart his campaign in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, where he has failed to duplicate his Southern success _ or even to register in double-digits in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. He reacted strongly when asked by a questioner whether he has been privately encouraged to rop out of the presidential race in order to stop splitting the white vote _ a question that suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was profiting by the battle between <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the `` question has a racial if not racist premise.'' He said he had not been so urged and called it inappropriate to talk about such racial divisions.

 Republican Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> met Thursday with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and expressed `` deep concern'' on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the resignations of two of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s top aides. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was the strongest signal to date of growing bipartisan concern in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over whether the attorney general, the focus of an 11-month criminal investigation, can continue to run the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` A number of people on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have expressed deep concern about the problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said in a statement after the meeting. `` I went today to talk to the attorney general to convey these concerns to him.'' Minutes after the meeting, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> refused to answer reporters' questions about the resignations when he attended a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters on a drug bust Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions that Solicitor General Charles Fried, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-ranking official, this week urged <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to resign but was rebuffed According to the newspaper, Fried told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in a meeting Wednesday that the attorney general's legal problems were creating turmoil within the department. After the meeting, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he hoped and expected that the solicitor general would stay on. Department officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that Fried had stressed that he was making no judgment on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was guilty of a crime. They said Fried told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the mounting dispute over his leadership and ethical standards was hindering the department's work. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> feels strongly that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has to go for the good of the department,'' one official told the Times. Fried, reached at home Thursday night by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, refused to discuss any aspect of the story. `` I'm not going to comment on that,'' he said. The Times also reported that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the retired <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, said Fried called him Monday evening `` very upset and concerned, and very perplexed about what he should do.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who said Wednesday `` there's no reason'' for him to resign, said he would answer questions on the resignations of his aides `` within the next several days'' when `` I hope and I fully expect ... to be announcing various appointments to fill those vacancies.'' `` The business of law enforcement is going forward energetically and without interrupton,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` Our strong management team is on the job.'' The attorney general, a longtime confidant of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, stood somberly next <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief praised Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who quit Tuesday because they felt <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continuing legal troubles were hurting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operations `` I think they're very fine gentlemen, served their government well, are to be commended for the service that they performed,'' Sessions said when asked about <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who oversaw all federal criminal investigations. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in response to a reporter's question, said he had no plans to meet with <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> later in the day, neglecting to mention that he had already done so. After the news conference and after <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> already had issued his statement, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> issued a clarifying statement confirming that the meeting had occurred before the news conference. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee meeting in the morning that he would n't `` countenance any corruption in any way, shape or form in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or any other department.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday, and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources subsequently confirmed, that <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> during a meeting Tuesday that the criminal investigation of the attorney general was a close call in terms of whether the attorney general should be prosecuted. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> went on to say that if he were the independent counsel investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, he would present the case to a grand jury seeking indictment, according to the sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said Thursday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should meet with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and then reconsider whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should stay on the job <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s reported remarks require a presidential inquiry and decision. On Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., said flatly that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> also called for his resignation, saying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was `` the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration history.'' Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., told reporters Thursday that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> encounters difficulty in finding capable replacements for <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and there is evidence the department is not functioning well, and `` he ought to step aside. But Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader, said he was `` appalled'' at the hue and cry over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` They've never laid a glove on him yet,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, adding there is no indication <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is guilty of anything. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, said reports that the first lady was campaigning for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s removal were `` absolutely not true.'' `` She has n't talked to anyone and no one has talked to her about the issue,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was visiting before joining the president at their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch Friday for an Easter vacation. The criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> launched last May 11 by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is continuing, and so far has delved into his involvement through longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline project. A partner in the pipeline project, Swiss financier <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, had been scheduled to give a deposition about the case to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> last month but backed out and has apparently decided not to cooperate with the investigation, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions. The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and abroad, said <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> was scheduled to give sworn testimony at a meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and his aides but changed his mind at the last minute because he was afraid he might not remember everything accurately. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> was to have been given immunity from prosecution in the case. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> widened the probe this week by subpoenaing payroll records and other documents of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in connection with a $ 40,000-a-year job <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, got with the charity in 1985 Investigators are examining <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s role in helping Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> get the job.

<HEAD>Comets Not Unaltered Relics of Solar System's Birth, Analysis

<TEXT>
 Comets do not deserve a reputation as pure samples of material from the birth of the solar system, because they have been altered in deep space, suggests an analysis published today. Heat from very bright stars and star explosions called supernovae has altered their characteristics, researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> propose. `` There's no such thing as a pristine comet,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shull </PERSON>, who presented the analysis with colleague <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> in today's issue of the British journal Nature. Comets are essentially dirty snowballs that formed at the birth of the solar system. Scientists study them for clues to the conditions surrounding the formation of the sun and planets. Trillions of comets are thought to orbit the sun some 10,000 to 100,000 times as far away as the Earth's orbit, <PERSON> Shull </PERSON> said. Those comets have never been seen, but astronomers do spot comets that have left that orbit and swung in toward the sun. While still in their distant orbits, the analysis contends, the comets have been heated to differing extents by passing stars and by supernova explosions. That caused boiling that obliterated the original structure and chemical composition of the comet surfaces, the analysis says. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, professor of physics and astronomy at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, called the proposal intriguing. Comets that return to view on a regular schedule have certainly been heated and modified by repeated trips near the sun, he said, but comets making their first trip to the inner solar system are thought to contain pristine material. `` Their hypothesis is not likely to be easily tested by remote observations from the ground or from earth-orbiting observatories, but will await future missions to comets which can actually measure the composition and structure of the ice directly'' he said.

 The nephew of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s founding president has been fined $ 5,000 and credited for time served for his role in a 1,900-pound marijuana importation conspiracy. `` For your greed, you ... have failed your government and certainly your family,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON> said Wednesday in sentencing <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON>, 36, nephew of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s first president <PERSON> Jomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyatta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON> walked away a free man after paying the fine and serving more than five months in jail since his arrest in October on charges of conspiring to import the marijuana. Three co-defendants were sentenced to prison. <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON> pleaded guilty to conspiring to import an unspecified quantity of the drug, which carries a maximum term of five years in prison. <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON>, who sentenced two Kenyan co-defendants to six years in prison and a third to nine years for their guilty pleas, found that <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON> played a `` truly passive'' role `` limited to greed,'' in the scheme. A fifth Kenyan, millionaire arms dealer and land developer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mwangi </PERSON>, 49, was found innocent after a trial earlier this month. A Ugandan defendant, <PERSON> Mpigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbogo </PERSON>, 39, is to be sentenced Monday. The six men were arrested after they traveled to <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the pot had just arrived aboard a ship. They were to be paid $ 1 million in the deal, negotiated through undercover agents in telephone calls to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Though <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON>'s crime was an `` affront to the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON> said he was satisfied <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON> was remorseful and had learned a `` bitter lesson.'' He also took note that <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON> was the first to plead guilty. <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON>, dressed in a gray pin-stripped suit and white loafers, apologized for his involvement in what he called an `` unfortunate incident.'' `` I would like to assure you, sir, that I do n't intend and I do n't think I will ever stand in another court of law for charges of any sort of criminal activity,'' he told the judge. <PERSON> Muiga </PERSON>'s his attorneys argued that <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON>'s co-defendants invited him to meet with wealthy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessmen interested in developing some of his property. Even after learning the discussions with the `` businessmen,'' who turned out to be federal agents, concerned marijuana, <PERSON> Muigai </PERSON> went along, hoping still to discuss the land deal, the court papers said. The stiffest sentence, nine years, went to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuku </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON> determined was the principal in the deal for making the contacts with the sources of the marijuana and the other defendants. <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON> found that <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumbo </PERSON>, 45, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Githegi </PERSON>, 36, had less culpability and gave them six-year prison terms. They pleaded guilty to conspiring to import more than 110 pounds of marijuana, a charge carrying a 20-year maximum penalty.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says he should have been more sensitive to an appearance of impropriety in helping <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> set up a financial partnership with an investment manager who wound up on the board of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview published Thursday in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Mercury News, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said that he `` missed the boat completely'' on the potential conflict of interest in linking <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with the investment manager, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in May 1985. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew at the time that <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was doing work for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> subsequently become a member of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> were indicted in December on racketeering charges for allegedly extracting payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> as part of a scheme to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials to assist the defense contractor. In 1981 and 1982, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> a dozen memos urging the then-White House counselor's support for the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> defense contractor. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> interceded on <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf in connection with the company's efforts to get a $ 32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the army. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> ended up wining the contract in 1982. `` I just missed the boat completely on the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> connection,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said, referring to the potential for a conflict of interest. `` <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> at the time was just an irrelevancy. `` I knew that my memos -LRB- to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- had had nothing to do with the award of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- contract in 1982. ... We -LRB- <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- were trapped by our own honest conduct. We never thought of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. ... Our state of mind in April'85 was, we had not played a major role in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> also insisted that neither he nor <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was aware of memos in 1981 and 1982 from then <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel Fred Fielding warning <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s top deputy and other administration officials not to intercede in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s military contract discussions because of ethical and procedural considerations. `` On reflection, a more cautious approach on my part would have been wise,'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. `` A more cautious approach on his -LRB- <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s -RRB- part would have been wise.'' In the interview with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had `` nothing absolutely'' to do with a $ 150,000 payment to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in 1985 in connection with a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline deal. The $ 150,000 was a legal fee to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> by one of his clients, Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the pipeline project. The $ 150,000 wound up in a stock trading account owned by <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and the money was, in effect, pooled with that of other investors, including <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, to generate profits in highly speculative stock trading of brand new stock issues which were bought and sold on the same day. Under this arrangement, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> turned a $ 40,000 profit for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 50,000 investment in just 18 months. The pooling of money from <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s various investors, including <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, helped the financial manager obtain the funds to get new stock issues. It would have been difficult for <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> to obtain the new issues of stock with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s money alone. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said that when all of the facts are known, his and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s handling of the $ 150,000 originally paid to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> will emerge as `` the classic bureaucratic error.'' He declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said the main reason he introduced <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> stood to make more money investing with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> than with more conventional institutions. `` I probably was influenced disproportionately by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s offering a high return,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said `` Should I have been more prudent and recommended him -LRB- <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- to a more major investment firm?'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> asked. `` In retrospect, yes.''

 A recent survey shows that while about 70 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults indicate they watch television during the evening hours, only 12 percent said it is their principal activity. `` We found that most people are not just simply couch potatoes, but do a number other things with their free time,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a research consultant for Lexington-based <ORGANIZATION> Decision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Most adults reported they combine television viewing with other activities, such as cooking, cleaning and doing crafts, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> survey, a follow-up to a previous leisure time poll released last year, asked 1,000 adults during October, November and December to describe how they spent the previous evening from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. Reading was the second most popular activity, particularly among older respondents, with 22 percent reporting books or magazines as part of their evening. Men comprised the majority of the 18 percent saying they worked during the evening, while the 9 percent reporting they shopped were mostly women, according to the survey. Other top activities included dining out, 12 percent; with sports or exercising, going to a meeting or having sex each noted by 2 percent of the respondents. One percent went to a movie. `` We had a lot of other responses from knitting to spent last night in jail to skinning a raccoon,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. Yet only 15 percent rated their evening as `` great,'' with satisfaction higher among older or married respondents or people with annual incomes above $ 50,000. The recent survey was launched after <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> researchers last year found that many respondents felt their leisure time was diminishing. `` We thought this was curious considering all the labor-saving equipment and that, in theory, people have a five-day work week,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> DRC </ORGANIZATION> research, however, indicates that people perceive they have less leisure time because of the trend toward highly structured activities outside of work, said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` When I ask you what are your favorite leisure activities, you might say sailing or something,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` You are not likely to say you love going swimming at the health club five mornings a week, although that is something you chose to do. It's not a question that people have less leisure time. It's that people are losing their discretionary time; time that is for myself.'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> noted that the low percentage of inveterate `` couch potatoes'' suggest people are seeking to gain more control over their free time. `` I think we are looking here at people exercising more freedom of choice,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` It shows they can exercise their discretionary power to pick what gives them pleasure rather than accepting what's out there in a passive way.''

<HEAD>Maryland Insurance Ruling Helps Radar Detector Advocates</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> says he drove with a radar detector in his car for years without an accident. But his insurance company dropped him anyway and eventually hit a roadblock that forced it to restore his coverage. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> insurance commissioner two weeks ago, citing data that drivers like <PERSON> James </PERSON> are no more likely to crash than drivers who do n't carry radar detectors, threw out <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s rule against underwriting drivers who own radar detectors. It was under that rule that <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION> canceled <PERSON> James </PERSON>' policy, but a trade association called RADAR won him reinstatement and filed a complaint with state officials. `` I've never had an accident,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 45, who commutes to work in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. He said he bought the detector after speeding unintentionally and getting a ticket. `` I do n't speed anymore, I outgrew that years ago.'' An estimated 4 million people nationally use radar detectors, and advocates hope the ruling in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> will help keep them legal. `` This is the first ruling of its kind in the country,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defending </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airwave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group. The devices, which alert drivers that police may be tracking them by scanning for certain radar frequencies, are illegal in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Legislation to ban the detectors was introduced this year in 12 states and still has a chance of passing in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, whose organization represents about a dozen manufacturers with an estimated $ 300 million in yearly sales. `` Geico tried to make law, and the commissioner told them they had to play by everybody else's rules,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. The ruling, written by Associate Deputy Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimondi </PERSON>, criticized <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION>'s `` vision -LRB- of -RRB- itself as the Good Witch of the North who, alone among the 800 property and casualty insurers, is pointing the magic anti-radar wand of the good corporate citizen in condemnation of the use of radar devices by the citizens of this state.'' Highway safety groups say the detectors ought to be illegal because they are used primarily to break the law. `` Speed is not a function of emotion or economics or politics,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Speed is a function of physics: The faster you go, the more likely it is that you'll have an accident.'' Companies such as <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest auto insurer, and <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said they have no detector rules because most states recognize the devices as legal. Insurers also cited the dearth of direct evidence. The insurance industry does not know how many accidents or how many claims are related to detectors, said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> of the industry-funded <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` We oppose speeding and the use of radar detectors. -LRB- But -RRB- it's very hard to statistically support that people with radar detectors have more accidents,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, director of automobile underwriting for <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest auto <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that, although it might lose money on drivers with radar detectors, its data would not support a ban in court, <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- guideline was a little arbitrary,'' <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, last week failed to win an injunction against the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> order, but says it will appeal in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. And a study in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> may show whether speeders are likely to be using radar detectors. The federally financed study by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is slated for completion late this year. It will use two radar units to clock car speeds in four states. One undetectable radar _ using a specially licensed frequency _ will observe speeds before and after a detectable signal is turned on. Using the same method last year in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the industry-backed <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> found that 29 percent of cars going faster than 70 mph, and 19 percent going 66 mph to 70 mph, slowed down abruptly when they encountered the second radar. `` We know the effects of speed, and we know that these -LRB- radar detectors -RRB- cause drivers to go faster. Therefore, our conclusion is that people who use radar detectors would cause higher'' numbers of fatalities, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, vice president of the institute. Arguing before the commission, <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION> used that study and others to calculate that drivers using detectors are equal to drivers `` with two more more violations and would have 2.41 times as many accidents.'' RADAR, on the other hand, cited a survey showing that drivers using detectors were involved in fewer accidents and were more likely to wear seat belts than drivers as a whole.

 There are at least four men in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prisons who have something in common with a new inmate, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>: They all killed somebody in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Aug. 26, 1986. But the similarities end there. Unlike the killer of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, they are serving their time in obscurity. No camera-wielding mobs hounded them when they surrendered, no tabloids splashed their names in headlines. All four cases were in the impoverished <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, uptown from the grassy spot in Central Park where the former prep school student killed Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, from the bar on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s East Side patronized by Chambers, Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and other affluent young people. `` It is n't fair,'' said <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Traverso </PERSON>, 16, a neighbor of one of the victims, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dueno </PERSON>, 44. `` They make such a big deal out of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death and <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>'s death means nothing.'' Chambers, 21, started a five - to 15-year sentence Saturday for killing Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, 18, during what he initially called an episode of `` rough sex. The day before, while a jury deliberated murder charges against him, he pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter. Chambers and the other defendants all killed people they knew, and they were arrested quickly. Three of the four <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> killers pleaded guilty after bargaining with prosecutors, as <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> did. But none went through the protracted litigation that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> did, and all but one are serving longer sentences. The one who received a lighter term was Ms. <PERSON> Dueno </PERSON>'s killer, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON>. He had a history of beating Ms. <PERSON> Dueno </PERSON>, who was his girlfriend, and on Aug. 26, 1986, he stabbed her to death. He was never charged with murder. He pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter and was sentenced May 19 to two-and-a-third to seven years in prison. In a city that averages about five homicides a day, the deaths of Ms. <PERSON> Dueno </PERSON> and the others were largely unnoticed. The disposition of the cases went unnoticed as well: _ <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, charged with second-degree murder for shooting <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> to death, pleaded guilty last May 14 to first-degree manslaughter. Justice <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinkson </PERSON> sentenced him on June 26 to seven to 21 years in prison. _ A grand jury charged <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinones </PERSON> with second-degree murder in the stabbing of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajooh </PERSON>, 48. She allegedly had shot at him once when he tried to rob her and had reported him to police. After a non-jury trial, Justice <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> convicted <PERSON> Quinones </PERSON> of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced him on Oct. 7, 1987, to 12 -LCB- to 25 years in prison. _ <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, indicted on a charge of second-degree murder after he smashed his father's head with a sledgehammer, pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced by Justice <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> on Oct. 13 to six to 18 years in prison. There is no indication as to whether the families of the victims were consulted when the guilty pleas were negotiated; prosecutors gave the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family the right to veto their agreement with Chambers. And no news conferences were called when the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> cases were wrapped up. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> district attorney's office, said the assistant district attorneys who prosecuted the cases were not available to discuss them, or to compare them with the more celebrated case in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> `` It's apples and oranges,'' he said. `` What happened there, happened there. What happens here, happens here.''

 For $ 2 or so, you can hungrily cradle a barrel of popcorn while watching characters in `` Babette's Feast'' ravish blini with black caviar, quail stuffed with foie gras and other magnificent morsels in what has to be one of the most inspiring meals ever shown on the screen. For $ 88 more, you can follow this feast for the eyes with one for the body. `` One thing will happen after you see this movie: You will be starving,'' said <PERSON> Dro </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Proudian </PERSON>, general manager at <ORGANIZATION> Petrossian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose restaurant is one of several around the the country serving the seven-course feast during the run of the movie, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s entry for an Academy Award as best foreign film. `` When you see the film, how complicated the meal is, how expensive, all the marketing,'' there will be a greater understanding of the art of preparing a great meal, said <PERSON> Yannick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cam </PERSON>, chef and owner at <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavillion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which begins serving the feast in April. The movie, based on a story by <PERSON> Isak </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinesen </PERSON>, tells of two unmarried and pious sisters who take a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> political refugee, <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>, into their home on the bleak coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, in return for housekeeping. Fourteen years later, when <PERSON> Babette </PERSON> wins 10,000 francs in the lottery, she repays them with a feast so strange to them that one sister, in anticipation, compares it to a witch's sabbath But <PERSON> Babette </PERSON> fills the hearts, as well as the bellies, of her 12 guests, mostly members of the sisters' religious community. `` It was a whole experience, that's why we did it,'' said <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who with her husband followed the film with dinner recently at <LOCATION> Petrossian </LOCATION>. `` I did n't leave a bite of anything. I ate every bite.'' So far, plans have been made for the feast at restaurants in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classics </ORGANIZATION>' gastronomic consultant for the dinners. Prices will vary slightly, with $ 80 the lowest, without wines, he said. That will buy: turtle soup; blini with black caviar; quail stuffed with foie gras baked in a pastry nest with truffle sauce; salad; cheeses; rum cake with candied fruit; fresh fruit; coffee. Add $ 35 for four wines. As the movie opens in more cities, theater owners and restaurateurs can use a guide written by <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> to help them present the feast and find such ingredients as turtle meat. While the meal is expensive, <PERSON> Proudian </PERSON> called it a bargain, noting the normal prices of just three ingredients: 30 grams of fresh Russian Sevruga caviar -LRB- $ 21 -RRB-; 2 -LCB- ounces of fresh foie gras -LRB- $ 15 -RRB-; three-quarters of an ounce of black truffle -LRB- $ 30 -RRB-. `` The people who come here are adventurous, a lot of romantic people,'' <PERSON> Proudian </PERSON> said in a recent interview at <LOCATION> Petrossian </LOCATION>, a mirrored and marbled restaurant near <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. To meet their expectations and recreate the sense of abundance evident on <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s table, he said, `` the caviar has to be heaping, you have to see the truffles, not just a speck here, a slice there. When you put your knife into the quail, you have to feel the foie gras.'' `` It was extraordinarily difficult, because we had to recreate a visual image on a plate,'' he said. <PERSON> Petrossian </PERSON>'s chef, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Attali </PERSON>, said he encountered one problem. In the film, the quail is served sitting in its pastry nest with the head on. Believing that would not be acceptable here, <PERSON> Attali </PERSON> fashioned pastry `` heads'' for the tiny game birds. But no matter how faithful, diners will not experience the same mood as in the film, <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> said: `` First the house in the film, and it was a little religious dinner. I do n't think we can reproduce that.'' Still, <PERSON> Proudian </PERSON> said, `` The star of the movie is the food. So if you are in this business, it's nice to see all of this dignity and respect given to the preparation of food.''

<TEXT>
 It looks more and more as though President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will leave office without achieving his stated goal of making <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> say `` Uncle.'' In the view of many Latin American experts, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy of keeping the pressure on <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s Nicaraguan government to bring about peace and democracy has failed. `` You have peace, but you do n't have freedom,'' says <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, an expert on national and international security affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` They're about to leave office, and they've got a Contra program that's falling apart on them,'' says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Latin American adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. As <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, senior associate specializing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, sees it, the stated goal of the policy has kept shifting. `` The first one was simply to interdict Nicaraguan arms to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. `` Then it was rather strongly implied that the idea was to bring down the regime. And now the idea is that if they -LRB- <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leaders -RRB- will change, everything will be all right.'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the president's chief spokesman, says the administration's goal remains the same: `` The situation is that we need aid to the Contras in the worst way.'' But questions remain whether Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to continue non-lethal aid and leave the door open for military aid, and the expected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote today, will help further <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s objectives. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said his goal is to keep pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> so they will live up to the promises of democratic reform that they made when they took over from dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979. At a news conference Feb. 21, 1985, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether he was advocating the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. His reply was: `` Not if the present government would turn around and ... say, ` Uncle. All right, come back into the revolutionary government, and let's straighten this out and institute the goals.''' Now that the two sides have agreed on a cease-fire, will <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led Sandinista government reform? And if it does n't, can the Contra rebels the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has backed survive as an effective force? Many think not. `` I think it would be awfully difficult to reorganize them,'' said <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>. `` I doubt if they would be particularly interested in that. I do n't think they would want to go through the convolutions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy again.'' King added that `` it's over for the time being unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> back up on what they say they are going to do, and have done, and the Contras change their orientation from where they are, which is: let's get some kind of political opening going.'' <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, too, sees `` the end of the resistance'' in the latest developments, `` barring some miracle or barring some violation before the truce is signed.'' `` If the Sandinistas do something stupid before that, the Contras can be saved,'' he said. King, the adviser to <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, said: `` The objective of the whole exercise in the beginning was to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security concerns in the region. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security concerns in the region are removal of the Soviet and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> advisers, guarantees of no bases, reduction of Soviet weapons and guarantees of no border crossing. `` Now they are at a point where they do n't have any of those things arranged, they're about to leave office, and they've got a Contra program that's falling apart on them,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` I think the whole thing is a disaster, frankly.'' The less partisan sources are not calling it a disaster, but they are n't proclaiming it a success either.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> continues to lead the nation in per capita federal spending, but <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is closing in, new federal figures show. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government spent about $ 5,421 per resident in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> last year, making it the leading state in per capita spending. But second-place <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ which moved up from third a year earlier _ was n't far behind at $ 5,317 per capita, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. That $ 104 per capita difference in spending between the states was down from a $ 246 spread in 1986. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, which had been second in 1986, dropped to third place with 1987 spending of $ 5,113. Both <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> benefit from their location adjacent to the nation's capital. Many federal agencies have offices in the suburbs, which also are home for consultants and suppliers of goods for the government. If it were a state, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> would easily lead in per capita spending, averaging $ 23,360. Nationwide, federal spending averaged nearly $ 3,433 per American last year, about $ 41 more than the year before. The report, `` Federal Expenditures by State for Fiscal Year 1987,'' broke down spending totaling $ 848 billion, covering virtually everything except interest on the national debt. Direct payments to people was the largest share, totaling $ 384 billion. That includes Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other such programs. Buying goods and services was second, with $ 196 billion spent. Salaries for federal employees totaled $ 127 billion, with $ 108 billion sent out to state and local governments and $ 33 billion spent on research grants, agriculture subsidies and various other purposes. Per capita, that amounts to $ 1,555 paid to individuals; $ 795 in procurement; $ 514 in salaries; $ 437 in grants to state and local government and other spending of $ 133. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s top finish included high levels of aid to state and local governments as well as pay for federal employees, but it was way down the list in payments to individuals. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> topped that category, with Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits for its large elderly population raising the state's average <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was easily the leader in total federal spending, with its large population, military bases and industry helping bring in $ 100.7 billion. Even so, the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> finished only 14th in per capita spending.

 Congressional investigators say the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> should tighten controls over its `` fast-pay'' program to avoid paying for supplies that are never delivered. According to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report released today, one <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> purchasing office failed to take action to ensure collection of more than $ 7 million in overpayments. `` I'm appalled that <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> is paying money for supplies that it never received,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who, along with Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., released the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report `` We need sound business management at <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The agency purchases food, clothing, fuel oil and other supplies for the armed services. Under the fast-pay program, the agency pays vendors based on shipping invoices instead of verifying receipt of the supplies. The procedure is designed to expedite payments for small purchases. `` Internal controls established by the <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> purchasing offices do not prevent possible fast-pay program abuse,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Potential missing depot shipments are not always detected for timely follow-up and resolution.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that in 52 fast-pay shipments valued at $ 71,267 to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the center could not document the receipt of 16 shipments valued at $ 18,618. In addition, the center failed to notify some of the vendors of the missing shipments within 90 days. It also said action had not been taken as of last May to collect more than $ 7 million in previously identified overpayments owed the Defense Personnel Support Center in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said that vendors with performance problems on previous contracts have continued to receive fast-pay awards and that controls have not been established to ensure the receipt of supplies sent directly from vendors to overseas locations. In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> issued instructions to limit the use of fast pay, saying it should not be used to replace stocks in depots or when timely payment can be made. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> believes it is not required to follow the requirements until they are incorporated into the Federal Acquisition Regulations. However, <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the agency plans to be in compliance with the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> requirements by the end of the year even though it is expected to cost an additional $ 2.5 million to process the extra paperwork.

<HEAD>House Votes To Rehire Some Controllers Fired In 1981</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation calling for the rehiring of 1,000 air traffic controllers fired nearly seven years ago has won strong approval in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to consider a similar bill. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has steadfastly refused to rehire any of the 11,400 controllers who were fired after they walked off their jobs in 1981. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has urged that such legislation be vetoed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if it clears <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The 234-180 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote Wednesday calling for some of the fired controllers to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> came two years after similar legislation was defeated by a 193-226 margin. Supporters of the legislation argued that there are too few controllers to handle air traffic needs, especially at some of the busiest towers and traffic control centers, and that the former controllers could become fully trained more quickly than trainees off the street. Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution, said a selected number of fired controllers should be rehired by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` for the sake of safety and the convenience of the flying public.'' `` Today it's clearer than ever that the air traffic control system is still severely strained,'' <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said during floor debate. The legislation calls for selectively hiring 500 of the fired controllers this year and another 500 next fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has estimated that as many as 6,000 of the 11,400 former controllers still have an interest in returning to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. Under the legislation the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would be free to select the controllers it wants to rehire. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has steadily been increasing its controller workforce and now has 14,450 controllers at various experience levels, compared with 16,375 before the 1981 strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to hire another 1,350 over the next 1 -LCB- years. While support for rehiring at least some of the fired controllers was widespread, some congressmen continued to have deep concerns about such a move. `` Putting the strikers and their replacements in the same control tower is sure to create animosity between the two factions,'' suggested Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON>, R-Ark. Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the legislastion is `` sending the wrong message'' to government workers and their unions. `` The right to fire illegal strikers must not be compromised,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> declared.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is being urged to lead the industrialized world into new, tougher action against the chemicals that scientists say are destroying the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer The call for strict international controls on chlorofluourocarbons, or CFCs, is coming from senators, scientists and two quarters that often are in deep disagreement: environmentalists and chemical companies. `` We need a massive diplomatic mission,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday as two <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees heard renewed warnings that <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s are depleting the ozone that shields humans from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. Committee members and witnesses took turns saying that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take the lead to push other industrialized nations into taking stronger measures against CFCs than contained in last year's <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocol. That agreement could lead to a freeze on global CFC production in 1999 at a level of 50 percent of the CFCs manufactured in 1986. To take effect, the protocol needs ratification by nations representing two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production. So far, only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have acted. CFCs are widely used as refrigerants and industrial solvents and in the production of foam products. They also serve as propellants in aerosol cans, although such use was banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1977. Witnesses said the administration should not only be pushing for ratification but also be lobbying for an emergency international gathering to consider a larger production freeze or even a ban on CFCs. The protocol provides for a <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> review meeting sometime in 1990. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he would press to have that meeting very early in 1990. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to make an accelerated schedule for <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> reductions a priority item this June when he and leaders of other industrialized democracies hold their annual economic summit Also calling for faster action was <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Irvine </ORGANIZATION> professor who in the 1970s was one of the first scientists to warn of dangers posed by CFCs. `` Clearly the protocol is not going to do much of anything for 10 years,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` We need more rapid action than that.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, senior attorney for the environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said a swift international response is needed in light of the conclusion announced March 15 by a panel of 100 scientists convened by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The panel said ozone depletion is occurring faster than previously thought. <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> said the losses cited by the panel already are at levels <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has projected for the year 2050 under the production cuts specified by the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> protocol. `` I think we can attain a new worldwide agreement in a year and end the use of these chemicals by the end of the century,'' <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> said. Joining the call for a stepped-up diplomatic effort were representatives of two major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of CFCs, E.I. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` All of us need to work to get as many nations as possible to ratify the protocol as quickly as possible,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION>'s Genetron Products <PERSON> Elwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, said his company believes that CFC-producing countries should be convened as soon as possible `` to review the scientific findings and to establish appropriate global responses to these findings.'' He and Ms. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said their companies have begun efforts to develop safe substitutes for CFCs, but neither could say when they might be available. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it was phasing out production of CFCs.

<HEAD>Coretta King Calls on Congress to Restrict Handgun Sales</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The widow of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has `` acquiesced too long to the gun lobby'' and she is urging lawmakers to vote to restrict sales of handguns. Speaking on the seventh anniversary of the shooting of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outside a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> cited the significantly lower murder statistics from countries that control handgun sales. Such restrictions, she said, `` are more effective than capital punishment'' in deterring killings. `` We need to end the needless sacrifices of men, women and children on the altar of congressional inaction.'' She later added: `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has acquiesced to the gun lobby. The only thing that will bring an end to this inaction is an aroused citizenry.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> then signed a giant-size petition, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handguns </ORGANIZATION>, that calls for restrictions on the sale of handguns. She will be honorary chairwoman of the petition drive along with <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the widow of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The petition drive, called `` A Time to Remember, A Time to End Handgun Violence,'' coincides with the 20th anniversary of the deaths of King and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on June 6, 1968. In a separate statement, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of White House Press Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was wounded in the attack seven years ago on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, pleaded to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for stronger handgun control laws. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said she supports legislation that would require a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases to allow police to conduct a background check. `` I'm firmly convinced that had such a proposal been in effect seven years ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> would have been prevented from purchasing the handgun he used to shoot the president, my husband and two law enforcement officers,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The National Coalition to Ban Handguns petition does not endorse any specific piece of legislation. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> of the coalition said `` we hope it will stimulate this Congress to enact a national waiting period requirement before a handgun may be purchased, to ban the sale of non-detectable -LRB- plastic -RRB- handguns and to ban Saturday Night Specials, the kind of handgun used to kill <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''

 Audiences seem to know what he means, but Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't always get the words out exactly right as he campaigned this week in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. During an appearance at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univeristy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, the Republican presidential candidate told his audience, `` I want to be the education president.'' `` There is a need for help at the federal level ... so you can afford to send your college to children,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. At another time in the same speech, he meant to talk about the `` high cost of college,'' but it came out: `` the high cost of courage.'' Speaking to a rally in a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to invent a new federal tax on farmers, declaring he favored a lower `` capital grains tax.'' No doubt, he was referring to the capital gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has urged a partial repeal of the part of the 1987 tax overhaul law that taxes capital gains _ such as from the sale of a house, stocks or business assets _ at the same level as other income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s verbal tongue-twisting seems to be catching. Introducing the vice president at another Milwaukee-area function, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> asserted: `` As the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency ends, it's time for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pregnancy to begin.''

 As he campaigned in the area, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was repeatedly reminded by local reporters of a previous campaign visit here, when he went to a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> bowling alley _ and wound up sprawled on the lane. Questions like `` Plan to do any bowling this time?'' have abounded. `` You have a good memory,'' he told one inqusitor. `` I did fall down. But so did nine pins,'' he said in defense of his technique.

 At an aviation musuem in <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was presented with a brown leather aviator's jacket and he climbed readily into the cockpit of a 1949 Bearcat fighter. The plane was billed as similar to one he had flown as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot during World War II, a past his campaign strategists would like to have remembered as often as possible. Well, it was n't exactly like the kind of planes he used to fly, `` but it has the same engine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who frequently has posed on and in various kinds of heavy equipment during his campaign, held his right arm over his head and flashed a `` V'' sign for photographers. `` Is this the Red Baron look?'' he asked. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was led to a full-scale replica of the Voyager, the lightweight plane that set a record for flying non-stop around the world. `` I'm anxious to learn about this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This looks like it may be a little tough.'' He elaborated further. `` There's the inevitable question,'' he said. `` How does one go to the bathroom?''

 The restored presidential yacht USS Sequoia is making a national tour before being returned once again to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after an 11-year hiatus. The Sequoia, which was sold in 1977 by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as part of an austerity move, has been repaired by a private group. It was launched Wednesday on a 100-city, 22-state tour that will enable thousands to see the vessel before it is officially returned to the White House Nov. 15. `` What we have here is a Fourth of July celebration every weekend in cities throughout the country,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON>, a member of the group that raised money to repair the 105-foot yacht. `` We're taking a piece of American history to the American people.'' Private and corporate funding paid for the Sequoia's restoration, and <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, who chairs the nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees, hopes the tour will raise money for an endowment to pay for the ship's upkeep `` This tour is a little like running a campaign,'' he joked. `` We have a good candidate, no opposition, and we're confident she wo n't screw up on the evening news.'' The Sequoia was built in 1925 and sold to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1931. In 1933, after President <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> wintered on it in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the Sequoia was acquired by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and became the president's official yacht. Over the next 44 years, the Sequoia served eight presidents. It was the site of talks on nuclear controls during the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> administration, the venue of gala celebrations by President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the place where President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> told his family in 1974 that he would resign the presidency. In 1977, as part of a widespread retrenchment program, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> directed that the vessel be sold. It was purchased for $ 286,000 by a group of private investors. Over the next four years, the craft changed hands three times and began to deteriorate. In 1981, a private trust was established to purchase and restore the boat. After reading news accounts in 1983 about the boat's dilapidated condition, <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, a former aide to Sen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, D-Ga., joined the effort to refurbish the craft `` I remember thinking it was a crying shame that this boat had fallen on such bad times, because I remember how it was used in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations,'' he said. Minor repairs were made, and a little-publicized, 16-state tour during the summer of 1984 drew surprisingly large crowds. `` Everyone told us it was a mistake for the federal government to have sold the Sequoia,'' <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said. `` We then started raising money for a full restoration, with the intention of returning the vessel to the office of the president.'' In June 1986, a six-month, $ 3.5 million restoration was completed, and the Sequoia sailed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the Statue of Liberty centennial celebration. Since then, the Sequoia has been moored in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and used for government functions. The Sequoia's tour will include ports in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in April, and to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in May. It then will sail up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in June and July, stopping at ports in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. After visiting Great Lakes ports in August, the Sequoia will stop at cities between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> in September. The tour will end Oct. 30 in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 In the Tang Dynasty 1,000 years ago, boatmen carried rice and supplies to fight the northern barbarians. Today, boatmen on barges still pass through <PERSON> Huaian </PERSON>, but now they carry coal and bricks to keep <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s great metropolises humming. Life goes on, changing but always the same along the world's longest man-made waterway, the 1,000-mile Grand Canal, which <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhua </PERSON>, a local official, describes `` as great a feat as the Great Wall. In <LOCATION> Huaian </LOCATION>, a 1,600-year-old town in coastal <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province, the canal remains the lifeline. Huaian is a bumpy, four-hour drive from the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> and has no railway. `` We have looked to the water in developing our land,'' said the local radio station director, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruoyuan </PERSON>. Every day about 1,200 barges, some in convoys of as many as 10, pass through the town's two locks, where they are lowered or raised about 10 feet. Along the shore, a sea of men in green and blue jackets load and unload the coal, grain, vegetables, oil, roof tile, cotton, lumber and gravel that traverse the 220-mile <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> stretch from the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the south to the city of <LOCATION> Xuzhou </LOCATION> in the north. The lucky ones have donkeys, but for most a strong back and sturdy shoulders are crucial. People strapped to harnesses tug at carts and wagons. On one bridge, a unique pulley system helps them up an incline. Bicycles weave around bridge-side stalls that sell cabbage, oranges, soft drinks and sugar cane. Children gather around to watch an elderly couple puff oats with a hand bellows that fires a blackened iron pressure vessel. Fishermen come by with cormorants perched on bicycle handlebars, taking the black seabirds to catch fish for them. Work on the canal began in the 6th century B.C. But the early 7th century Emperor <PERSON> Yangdi </PERSON> built the main sections, from the western capital of <LOCATION> Luoyang </LOCATION> eastward and the north-south channel linking <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modern-day capital. Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been mobilized for the project. Upon its completion, the emperor sailed its length at the head of a flotilla extending in close file for 60 miles. During the Tang Dynasty -LRB- 618-907 -RRB-, what served as the ministry of transport was in <LOCATION> Huaian </LOCATION>, and the city had a population of 200,000, double its current number, town official <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> said. The canal fell into disrepair after the <ORGANIZATION> Tang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynasty </ORGANIZATION>, but the <PERSON> Kublai </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> rebuilt it in the 13th century. The Communist government, after coming to power in 1949, has built an extensive irrigation and flood control system to make life easier for the people of this waterlogged, impoverished area. The town fathers also hope <PERSON> Huaian </PERSON>'s rich historical heritage will draw tourists. It was the home to <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, the Han dynasty -LRB- 206 B.C.-220 A.D. -RRB- general; <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chengen </PERSON>, writer of `` Journey to the West,'' the classic of the Ming Dynasty -LRB- 1368-1644 -RRB-, and the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. One small temple along the canal has a statue in memory of the `` washerwoman,'' an upright woman who helped Gen. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> when he was a poor boy and later refused a reward of 1,000 taels of silver. Near that temple, outside their one-room brick homes with upswept tile roofs, the washerwomen of today are still down at the canal, hard at work.

<HEAD>Retirees Spared Pension Tax Underpayment Penalties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retirees do n't have to worry any more about being penalized for underpayment of estimated taxes on their 1987 pensions. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it will waive penalties that otherwise would hit retirees who failed to pay sufficient tax in advance on their pensions. `` The idea is to have equity between retired people and wage earners,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Johnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. `` Retired people will now have the same benefits as wage earners.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> announced last year that it would not impose penalties on taxpayers who had too little withheld from their 1987 wages. That announcement was made because of widespread taxpayer confusion about the numerous tax-law revisions enacted in 1986 and a complex new W-4 withholding form. Even with these two waivers, taxpayers with large amounts of interest, dividends and other investment income still might be penalized if they have to pay too much tax when they file their returns. But the penalty would not apply to wage or pension portions of income. As a rule, at least 90 percent of 1987 tax liability must have been paid in advance through withholding or estimated quarterly payments. Withholding is not required on pensions, although most recipients opt to have tax taken out from each check. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said most retirees will be automatically covered by the waiver without having to take any additional action. Those who have already filed a return and paid the estimated-tax penalty will have any overpayment refunded. A taxpayer who receives a penalty notice dated before May 2, 1988, and has not responded should call the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> toll-free line for assistance, the agency said. That number is 800-424-1040. The waiver applies to any retirement income that must be reported on Line 16b of Form 1040, including <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> and profit-sharing distributions, employee savings plans, pensions and annuities. In another decision affecting retirees, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said owners of multiple IRAs who passed the age of 70 -LCB- in 1987 will be allowed more discretion in choosing from which <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to take a distribution. Such <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> owners are required to take money from an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> by April 1. A recent change in the law required those with multiple <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts to divide the minimum required distribution among those accounts. Under the change announced Wednesday a past-70 -LCB- <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> owner still will have to calculate a required distribution from each account but may then choose to take the entire payout from any one or more accounts. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> announcement said taxpayers who already have received payouts from their IRAs and want to take advantage of the new rule may be able to return the distribution to one or more accounts under existing `` rollover'' provisions. In general, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> owner has a 60-day period each year during which an account may be rolled over into another. This change could benefit, for example, a retiree who has some high-earning IRAs and some that are earning less. The retiree might find it beneficial to take the required minimum distribution from the less lucrative <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and keep the high earner intact.

 A relatively light snowfall this winter means an accordingly reduced likelihood of major spring flooding, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reports. `` Nothing in the outlook for the coming month indicates weather conducive to major snowmelt flooding,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON>, director of hydrology for the agency.

Plus, there is a potential for some minor snowmelt flooding in upper <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> due to an early March snowstorm in that area, officials said.

 Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says teacher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s dramatic success in teaching calculus to Hispanic teen-agers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> puts the lie to the notion that poor children can not learn. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> accompanied the <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> premiere of `` Stand and Deliver,'' a movie about <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>. `` I have been to his classroom. I have seen the miracle in process,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the opening-night crowd. `` <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> is dedicated to his students, he is dedicated to their future. He is a true, genuine American hero.'' <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> dined with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> beforehand after guest-teaching calculus at three suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> schools. Today he was being feted at the embassy of his native <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` I feel great. What you're going to see is 90 percent true,'' said <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, who is portrayed on film by actor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> of `` Miami Vice.'' `` I'm not doing anything new. I'm just helping my students reach their highest possible degree of personal development,'' he said. The movie shows how <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> cajoled a rambunctious group of teens from an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> barrio into taking calculus, only to have the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> suspect they cheated when they passed the Advanced Placement test en masse in 1982. They retook the rigorous exam and passed again with flying colors, and since then scores of <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s pupils have followed in their footsteps. Eighty-seven received advanced college credit in calculus last year. <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> sold math to them as `` the great equalizer'' and told the students that as descendants of the Mayans, they had math in their bones. `` The only thing I'm doing is sharing knowledge,'' said the teacher, who has seen the movie before and did n't stay for Wednesday night's showing. He left when the lights went down, telling <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> he was worn out from teaching calculus all day. Over dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> expressed concern that his students back at <LOCATION> Garfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> `` are falling way behind because of this trip,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> related afterwards. `` This guy is the real thing,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> emerged full of praise for the film, saying, `` I think we're going to see a lot more courses in calculus. I think it's going to obviously lend great support to the whole idea of expectations, of kids living up to what we expect of them `` It's a movie that defies the notion that children ca n't learn _ that children of poor circumstance and background ca n't have their part in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> himself has said repeatedly that poor minority children are best served by schools that hold them to rigorous standards, not ones that water down their demands.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> says he gave no serious thought to quitting politics after his presidential campaign fizzled and will try to keep his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership post in the next session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't have any regrets,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Wednesday in an interview a day after he exited the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential race. `` I think obviously you do n't like to lose. But I think it probably strengthens my convictions about politics and that you can make a difference.'' Relaxed in his Capitol office, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> still expressed frustration with his inability to blunt Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s success in running as the heir apparent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> maintained that was the main reason for his downfall _ not what he conceded were several tactical mistakes by his campaign. `` The bottom line is you ca n't beat <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I was running against <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the South.'' Added <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, `` It's just this promotion idea that you just ought to go up the ladder.'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` winner-take-all'' rules in the primaries and caucuses also contributed to his exit from the race, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. If delegates were divided proportionally, he said, `` I'd still be in the race.'' Although disappointed with the outcome of his presidential bid, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he was committed to serving out his full six-year term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which ends in 1992. In addition, he said he would seek to remain the Republican leader when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reorganizesafter this fall's elections. `` I do n't have anybody threatening me,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Pretty tough precinct, but I think we're in good shape.'' In analyzing the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential race, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded that his campaign organization had blundered, particularly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and that those mistakes weakened his candidacy early in the nominating process. The campaign, for example, did not respond to last-minute television ads by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raising questions about whether <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would increase taxes. His campaign spent heavily early in the nominating process, which caused problems in later contests. `` Now had we won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, we still would have had a tough race,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> we probably should have bypassed instead of getting in there,'' he added. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s win in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> helped boost the vice president to a sweep of the Super Tuesday primaries in the South, including <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> _ states the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign had hoped to win. After Super Tuesday came <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I knew that we were n't going to win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and I knew then it was probably over.'' The campaign, he said, would end with a `` little debt'' but he did n't know the exact amount. He also expressed reservations about the management of the campaign, saying: `` I think as far as organization, I'm not certain whether we had enough direction.'' Asked what he would do differently, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> replied: `` Keep the press off the plane.'' A contingent of reporters traveled on the same plane as <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and the senator said he thought he had received some unfair coverage during the campaign. For example, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> singled out the numerous stories written about one of his <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> associates, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who resigned as national finance chairman of the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign in January after reports raised questions involving his financial dealings. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complained that reporters on the campaign plane `` sit back there and they scheme up these little things and the next thing they're in Time or Newsweek.''

 Police recovered a page of notes written by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> that had been taken from a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> display case, and arrested the grandson of former football coach <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>. An investigator said the page of handwritten notes was found Tuesday at the home of 18-year-old <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>. Royal was arrested Wednesday evening, said university police Lt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The page was reported missing last week from a locked glass display case in a campus building. It was among six pages on display from a series addressing Euclidean rotation. Investigators from the district attorney's office and the university police department recovered the manuscript late Tuesday, said District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>. The investigators searched the duplex on a tip provided by Crime Stoppers, he said. Royal's grandfather coached at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from 1957 through 1976, was UT athletic director until 1979 and now is special assistant to the president of the university. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> did not return telephone calls for comment to his <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> residence. The younger Royal leaves near the <LOCATION> UT </LOCATION> campus but is not a student, officials said. The missing page is part of an archive of 60 to 70 pages `` upon which <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> wrote the notes representing his thinking as he was trying to work out his theories near the end of his life,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON>, librarian for the university's <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ransom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, the famed physicist who formulated the theory of relativity, apparently wrote the notes in the early 1950s. He died in 1955. The display case was locked and the glass unbroken when the theft was discovered. It is unclear whether the person who took the document had a key to the case or removed the document in some other way, <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> said. Although the page likely could have been sold for a few thousand dollars, its value far exceeds that amount, <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> said. `` For all of us, it's a piece of our heritage, and it is not to be replaced,'' he said. `` In that sense, it has no price.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has given the presidential candidates another $ 2.6 million, bringing the total dispensed from the public treasury for the 1988 campaign to $ 48.1 million. As of Wednesday, former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who is trailing far behind Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Republican delegate race, remained the leader in overall matching funds received, at nearly $ 8.5 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has collected $ 7.4 million and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race Tuesday, has received $ 7.1 million. Another recipient, Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, a congressman from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, also dropped out this week. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., faces loss of eligibility for matching funds by virtue of receiving less than 10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> notified the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, as is his legal prerogative, that he did not want the <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> `` beauty contest'' primary on March 20 to count toward his eligibility, said <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON>. A candidate may take that option if he chooses not to campaign actively in a given state. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s matching funds for continued campaigning will be cut off in 30 days unless he can get at least 20 percent in a primary contest before that time. If he did not, he could receive matching funds only for winding-down costs and debt satisfaction. The federal fund matches every contribution of $ 250 or less that the candidates raise from individuals. The fund is supported by the $ 1 voluntary checkoff on individual income tax returns. To be eligible, a candidate must first raise $ 100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $ 250 or less, with a minimum of $ 5,000 total from each state. The amounts certified on Wednesday, followed by the total the candidates have received to date, are: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, $ 557,185, $ 7.4 million. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, $ 469,054, $ 7.1 million. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, $ 254,386, $ 5.9 million. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, $ 286,176, $ 2.6 million. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, $ 117,312, $ 2.7 million. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, $ 450,547, $ 1.5 million. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, $ 307,766, $ 8.5 million. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, $ 115,346, $ 2.8 million.

<TEXT>
 Violent protests have persisted despite an army ban on free news media access to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, challenging Israeli contentions that television cameras fueled Palestinian riots. The measures against the media have been unprecedented in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 20-year occupation of the territories. Reporters and photographers have been barred for at least three days and possibly longer from entering the areas where 1.5 million Palestinians live alongside 65,000 Jewish settlers. The only access is with Israeli army escorts, a procedure that prevents journalists from talking freely with Palestinians. Authorities also have sought to cut off major sources of information such as the Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The news agency offices were padlocked by police on Wednesday. Neither measure has been entirely effective. The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has remained sealed, because of its geographic isolation and because telephone lines have been cut. But reporters have circumvented roadblocks in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> by using back roads, traveling with Jewish settlers or identifying themselves as tourists. And <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists have continued to keep the foreign news media informed of breaking developments via telephone calls. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has argued that the media restrictions coupled with preventative arrests, economic sanctions and other measures will eventually have a calming effect. `` The cumulative effect of the measures ... will join to form a system that will bring calm,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Reflecting official thinking, <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>, who headed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military government in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from 1974 to 1976, said in an interview that news coverage was a key to the Palestinian uprising `` One of the most important elements of the uprising is to win international sympathy and cause damage to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the hope that this will have political effect, as well,'' said <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>, now of <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` The restriction of the media is aimed at harming their campaign for world public opinion. This is a step <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is taking to weaken the Palestinians, not to get at the journalists.'' More than 120 Palestinians have been killed since violence began Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s use of bullets to quell the riots prompted international criticism, as did the policy of beating protesters. Liberal critics of the media restrictions, who were decidedly in the minority, argued that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was sacrificing democratic principles. <PERSON> Ido </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissentchik </PERSON>, editor of the mass circulation Maariv daily, said in an interview the closure was a `` heavy price to pay.'' `` I think it's an hysterical step. I hope that it does n't indicate that people in authority are losing their heads,'' said <PERSON> Dissentchik </PERSON> `` Israeli authorities must live with this problem called democracy.'' There has been a solid consensus among ordinary Israelis that the riots were feeding off media coverage and that it would be foolish and self-destructive to allow it to continue. The psychological basis for the decision to close off the areas, at least in part, involves a unique Israeli sensitivity about being a victim. One of the worst insults in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to be called a `` fryar,'' Hebrew slang for patsy, a person who lets other people take advantage of him. Many Israelis feel they are becoming just that: victims of their own openness and democratic traditions. Officials also argue <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been subjected to a double standard by the foreign news media, and that no Arab state would have used the restraint <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has shown. `` When Arabs kill Arabs it's not news,'' said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials also complained the media gave prominence to the bloodshed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> but ignored loss of life elsewhere in the world. One cited what he described as relatively fleeting coverage of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s alleged use of chemical weapons on Iranian-occupied Kurdish villages in which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed 5,000 people were killed. Another pointed to a newspaper that gave front-page play to the shooting death of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman but carried deep inside the paper the story of hundreds of people reportedly massacred in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` If this is the double standard the world is going to adopt, then we can do without them,'' said the official. Officials also alleged anti-Israeli and even anti-Semitic bias. They showed a reporter newspaper stories or cartoons equating Israeli measures against Palestinians with those used against Jews by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or which used Jewish symbols such as Stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON> or menorah candelabras.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill To Revive Domestic Uranium Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved legislation designed to revive the domestic uranium industry in a move that bodes serious problems for a U.S.-Canadian trade pact. The measure, sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 62-28 vote Wednesday, also would restructure the government-owned industry, which prepares uranium ore for use as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors. The legislation has prompted concern over the trade agreement because it would impose a schedule of escalating fees on nuclear utilities that load their reactors with more than 37.5 percent foreign uranium. Opponents, including Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., argued that the provision would violate the recent free trade pact signed with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a leading exporter of uranium that is cheaper and of higher grade than the ore produced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mills An attempt by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> to strike the import penalties lost 47-45. In arguing for the bill, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, complained that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s treaty negotiators let the Canadians say, in effect, that `` We not only want your -LRB- uranium -RRB- market, we want to wipe you out.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has vowed to veto any bill that violates the trade pact. The legislation would convert the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s uranium enrichment program, a multibillion-dollar loser since the mid-1970s, into a corporation owned by the government. If the enterprise begins turning profits, the treasury could sell the stock in a bid to recover previous investments. Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., who guided the measure through his <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said it is `` the culmination of six years of legislative effort to fashion a sound, sensible, and well-balanced program to address the challenges we face today in the uranium industry and the nuclear fuel cycle. He estimated the bill would restore 20,000 jobs in the uranium mining industry, which has dwindled to just 2,000 workers in this decade. And he estimated the uranium enrichment workforce, cut by half since 1980, could be restored to at least 12,000 jobs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was once the world's only supplier of enriched uranium, and the domestic nuclear power industry has grown at a far slower rate than originally projected. The number of domestic uranium mines dropped from 362 in 1979 to 3 in 1986; net earnings for the industry were negative the last three years; and imports accounted for an increasing share of domestic requirements. Opponents say a provision settling the industry's debt to the government for enrichment costs in exchange for $ 364 million in future payments is a bailout for the industry. Their estimates of the real cost range from $ 3 billion to $ 8.8 billion. The 1954 Atomic Energy Act required the government to be fully compensated for its enrichment of nuclear fuel used by commercial utilities. The process is performed at three DOE facilities, at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Enrichment involves increasing the percentage of fissionable material in natural uranium from 0.7 percent to about 3 percent, the amount necessary for use in light-water reactors. Although the legislation would impose import fees on utilities using more than 37.5 percent foreign uranium, the utilities would be able to buy up to half their uranium from foreign suppliers without penalty starting in 1995. Another section of the bill would create a $ 1 billion fund to clean up or stablize large, mildly radioactive piles of uranium tailings at 26 sites in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The cost would be shared equally by uranium mill owners, nuclear utilities and the government.

 An 18-year-old woman, whose quest to end her pregnancy was upheld by a district court but blocked an hour later by the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, obtained an abortion between the two rulings Wednesday, a court spokeswoman said. The appellate court had scheduled a Monday hearing to consider 25-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' appeal of 3rd District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s decision to vacate an earlier restraining order, which banned <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' estranged wife, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, from ending her pregnancy, in its eighth weeks. The higher court's ruling was issued within an hour of <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s decision, but <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who did not attend the court proceedings, had an abortion before she was served with the appellate court order, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacnik </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state court system `` She did have the abortion before she was served with the papers, which would've prevented her from doing so,'' <PERSON> Gacnik </PERSON> said. `` It was during that time lapse between when the ban was lifted and when the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issued its own restraining order.'' <PERSON> Gacnik </PERSON> said Monday's hearing was now `` a moot issue,'' although Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' attorneys had not filed a motion to vacate the appellate court's order as of the close of court offices late Wednesday. `` I would n't be surprised if her attorney filed a motion to vacate the hearing, but that remains to be seen,'' <PERSON> Gacnik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who last week ruled that Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> could not have an abortion pending resolution of a divorce-related custody dispute involving both a 10-month-old infant and the unborn child, accepted arguments by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorneys Wednesday that the woman has a constitutional right to end her pregnancy. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said while <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> may have the right to be consulted about any abortion involving Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, she had the ultimate authority over whether to carry the fetus to term. Following the hearing, defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolowitz </PERSON> said he believed his client would `` secure an abortion'' as soon as possible. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, said Monday's hearing might be pointless if the fetus had been aborted. `` If the abortion has taken place, we're going to have to make some serious evaluation ... there's a pretty good argument that would make it moot,'' he said. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is one of four states with laws requiring wives to notify husbands of abortion decisions. During arguments before <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dolrowitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> wanted the court to order Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to `` do what he -LRB- Reynolds -RRB- wants to do with her body.'' Young's earlier restraining order was in effect `` telling my client that she must use her body to carry his baby,'' <PERSON> Dolowitz </PERSON> added. Co-counsel <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> that husbands have no veto power over their wives' abortion decisions The high court ruled that when a husband and wife disagree over an abortion, `` the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy ... the balance weighs in her favor,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>HHS Chief Urges Cholesterol Testing In Effort Against Heart
Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government's top health official has some advice for Americans on how to avoid heart attacks: Get your cholesterol checked and do something about it if it's too high. `` Most people can lower their cholesterol level by reducing the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in their diet,'' <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Some need a combination of diet and drugs.'' His point was that anyone can lower his or her blood cholesterol, and that anyone with a level above 200 milligrams-per-deciliter _ which puts them at excessive risk for heart attack _ should do so. That 200-milligram level takes in about half of all adult Americans. `` About one in four adults has a cholesterol number of 240 or more, which puts them at even greater risk and commands medical attention,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` First, know your number,'' said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` Getting your level checked is the only way to find out. Cholesterol, like high blood pressure, is a silent killer. There are no signs or symptoms.'' About 400 hospitals across the nation will offer cholesterol testing May 4. Most will do it free, but a few will charge $ 3. That mass screening, the first in history, was organized independently by the <ORGANIZATION> Voluntary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and announced last week. Television spots promoting the program, called `` CountDown <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' began airing this week and include a toll-free telephone number _ 800-634-9541 _ for people to call weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST to find out which hospitals in their areas will offer the testing. An initial screening can be simple and quick. Small machines _ about 6,000 have been sold since they won market approval two years ago _ take about three minutes to analyze blood drawn from a finger-tip stick. If that preliminary figure is within the safety zone, no further testing is indicated. If it is borderline or high, a more elaborate analysis is needed of a regular blood sample. Television and radio talk show host <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said his cholesterol count was above 300 a little over a year ago. `` I did n't pay attention to it,'' he said. `` I had a heart attack Feb. 24, 1987. I had quadruple heart bypass surgery Dec. 1, 1987.'' King pays attention now, he said, and has his count down to 170. He also is featured in public service spots to be aired during the next few weeks urging people to get tested. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said research has shown that each 1 percent reduction in cholesterol results in a 2 percent reduction in the risk of heart disease. `` In other words, a reduction of 25 percent in the cholesterol level can cut the risk of heart disease in half,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was in the White House and Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> was one year away from making his last stand when <PERSON> Orpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was born Aug. 13, 1875. Mrs. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, believed by the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> to be the world's oldest person, died Wednesday at age 112. She had pneumonia recently, but an official cause of death was not released, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON>, director of nursing at <LOCATION> Fountainview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> lived. `` Her condition worsened during the weekend,'' Miss <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> said. `` She could n't do anything for herself anymore,'' said a stepdaughter-in-law, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. `` You ca n't do anything for a person who does n't want to live anymore.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she was saddened by the death, but said Mrs. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> had lived a good life. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> officials said they believed she was the oldest person alive. Mrs. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was honored at a special ceremony in January when officials placed the <LOCATION> Goshen </LOCATION> city seal on census documents indicating she was born in 1875 on the family farm near <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> about 10 miles away. She spent most of her life in <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> until moving to the nursing home in 1982. <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, who lived in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb, had been recognized as the world's oldest person until her death Jan. 11. She was 114 years and 94 days old. Guinness restricts recognition to those who can provide birth records and other documentation. There had been some confusion whether Mrs. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> would be 112 or 113 last Aug. 13. For years she had maintained she was a year older than she actually was. But a document found in the public library in this northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> city last September showed that the former <PERSON> Orpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulery </PERSON> was 4 years old when she was counted in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Census of 1880, making her 112. Mrs. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> attributed her longevity to her strict obedience to a biblical command, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said. `` She honored her father and mother.

<TEXT>
 Memory problems in rats caused by chronic alcohol intake were mostly reversed with brain tissue transplants, and such therapy may someday help alcoholics and victims of Alzheimer's disease, a researcher says. `` I think that really means there's hope, if you blow your mind with too much whiskey, maybe we'll be able to repair it with transplants,'' or similarly ease mental deficits in Alzheimer's, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. But experts in alcohol-induced memory problems were skeptical, questioning the resemblance of the rats' condition to that of alcoholics and cautioning that any implication for treatment is only speculation. Still, `` I think it's going to stimulate lots of excitement and lots of further research,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckardt </PERSON>, chief of the clinical brain research section in the laboratory of clinical studies at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, head of the psychology department at the psychiatric institute in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, reports the research with colleagues in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature. About 10 percent of alcoholics develop long-lasting memory loss, either by itself or as part of an overall loss in intellectual abilities, according to the federal alcohol institute. In the new work, 78 male rats drank an alcohol solution as the only fluid in an otherwise normal diet for 28 weeks. Four weeks later, they did poorer than other rats in learning to find food in a maze. But rats that then got transplants of fetal rat brain tissue to two brain areas, the neocortex and the hippocampus, later performed almost as well as normal rats, the researchers said. The fetal tissue was rich in a substance called acetylcholine, which some brain cells use to communicate. The transplants apparently worked by raising inadequate levels of the substance in the brain, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. Alzheimer's is not related to alcohol. But an acetylcholine defect has also been identified in that disease, which involves problems in memory and thinking, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drachman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, an Alzheimer's expert, said previous research has shown that impairment of the brain's acetylcholine circuitry can hinder mental performance. Treating that impairment has helped in regaining mental powers, he said. But Alzheimer's affects far more of the brain than just acetylcholine-using cells, and whether <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s strategy would significantly help Alzheimer patients remains to be seen, he said. In alcoholics, memory loss without other intellectual decline is called <PERSON> Korsakoff </PERSON>'s psychosis. <PERSON> Eckardt </PERSON> said scientists are still studying whether it is caused by excessive alcohol intake, by a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in the alcoholic's usually poor diet, or by a combination of those factors. The new research did not involve thiamine deficiency, so connecting its results to <PERSON> Korsakoff </PERSON>'s is speculative, <PERSON> Eckardt </PERSON> said. The rats did not display a type of brain damage, called diencephalic lesions, that is characteristic of <PERSON> Korsakoff </PERSON>'s. The researchers said that suggests the lesions are not responsible for the memory problems. But that is `` much too speculative,'' and clashes with evidence that does implicate the lesions, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Langlais </PERSON>, a Korsakoff's researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The lesions are generally accepted as causing the memory deficits in the condition, so the rats did not truly have an animal version of <PERSON> Korsakoff </PERSON>'s psychosis, said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, professor of neurology and psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>.

Here is a chronology of the ups and downs of that policy: 1981 _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, late in the year, approves $ 19 million in covert military aid to the rebels. The money, to be managed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, is part of a classified intelligence bill. 1982 _ A second infusion of $ 19 million, again part of a classified bill, is approved. This time, restrictive provisions are added that prevent any of the money from being used to overthrow the Sandinista government. There are reports, as well, that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has used an additional $ 10 million from its contingency fund. 1983 _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes to end Contra aid, but a later compromise results in the appropriation of $ 24 million for the rebels. This time, the money is appropriated openly, and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is barred from using any money from its contingency fund to supplement the new aid. 1984 _ In April, reports surface that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has supervised the mining of three Nicaraguan ports, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to cut off aid to the rebels. But at the end of the year, lawmakers vote to set aside $ 14 million for the rebels, to be released after Feb. 28, 1985, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves in a separate vote at that time. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adds new restrictions, saying the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> may not use the money to support paramilitary operations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> unless specifically authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. 1985 _ In April the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes to release the $ 14 million, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes against the resolution, denying the money to the rebels. That summer, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves $ 27 million for the Contras but restricts its use to food, clothing, medicine and other `` humanitarian'' aid. The money is directed to be used by the administration as leverage to promote peace negotiations, and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are barred from any role in distributing the money. 1986 _ In the fall, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves $ 100 million _ its largest single appropriation for the rebels _ the bulk of it for military aid. Restrictions on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s role are lifted, except that the agency remains barred from using its contingency fund. 1987 _ In March, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passes a moratorium on Contra aid in an effort to hold up the final $ 40 million of the aid bill approved in 1986, but the measure dies in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. At the end of the fiscal year, on Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> begins a series of stopgap funding measures that include money for `` non-lethal'' aid for the rebels totaling another $ 20 million. 1988 _ Under procedures laid out in late 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 3 kills President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for $ 36 million in rebel aid, including $ 3.6 million in military aid. A month later, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also rejects a Democratic alternative that would have provided $ 30 million in solely humanitarian aid. The rebels reach a negotiated truce with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> on March 23, and a new $ 48 million proposal is drafted in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with bipartisan support.

 Tenor <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> brought dignity and elegance to the title role of <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON>'s `` Werther,'' the final opera to enter this season's repertory at the Metropolitan Opera. Some tenors portray <PERSON> Werther </PERSON> as a self-pitying nut case as he pines for his beloved <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, who has married another man to fulfill a promise to her dying mother. But in Wednesday's performance <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> gave him the dignity of a man feeling overwhelming love. Vocally he was lean, elegant, refined, distinguished. <PERSON> Frederica </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stade </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> sang well throughout but rather blandly in the first two acts, as she denied her love for <PERSON> Werther </PERSON> and stuck steadfastly to her husband. In Act 3, with her love churning to the surface as Werther falls into suicidal depression, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stade </PERSON> came through with passionate vocalizing. <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> sang <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>'s sister <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> in a voice as fresh as spring. It almost seemed to lilt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON> did well with <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>. All voices were well focused. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournet </PERSON> conducted his first `` Werther'' at the Met, beautifully shaping the music. The present production, last heard at the Met eight years ago, was new in 1971. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON>'s sets for Acts 1 and 2 are realistic and attractive. After <PERSON> Werther </PERSON>'s mind cracks, set walls meet at odd angles. In the finale scene, his room looks like a coal cellar. `` Werther'' will be heard on the Metropolitan's last Saturday afternoon broadcast. The season ends April 16.

<HEAD>Jackson's Campaign Mainstays: `Economic Violence,' Anti-Drug
Message</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The message that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been preaching with startling success on the Democratic campaign trail is `` stop economic violence against American farmers and workers. Stop drugs. Invest in our children. Reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` There's nothing radical about his message,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the Texan who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration and now a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, said Wednesday. `` It's neither liberal nor conservative It's the core language of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' But much of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform is decidedly liberal and dovish. The candidate himself calls it `` the opposite of Reaganomics.'' He has promised a universal, comprehensive health program for all Americans, a goal of Democrats since <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. He wants to double the budget for education and raise the minimum wage. And he would pay for his social initiatives by raising taxes on the rich and slashing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has finished first or second in most of the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses and is close behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the delegate chase, has cast himself as the candidate of the displaced farmer and factory worker, the hungry and the homeless, and those who fear their toehold on financial security is precarious. `` Economic violence haunts the lives of most Ameicans,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a policy paper. `` There is nothing wrong with the American worker, the family farmer, or the small businessperson. There is something wrong with the system.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has called for a moratorium on family farm foreclosures; civil rights legislation to protect lesbians and gay men; tapping public pension funds to build housing, roads, mass transit and water systems; debt relief and an `` international <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan'' for the Third World; a national floor for welfare benefits; a phase-out of nuclear power; a freeze on nuclear weapons, and a halt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> insurgents in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He claims he could cut the deficit by one-third by raising taxes on `` the richest 1 percent'' of Americans and on corporations. Here are some of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s key positions:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says, `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is fatally flawed. It is not working for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> or for the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He has called for an alternative policy that `` moves the process that began at Camp David to the next progressive step.'' It would be built on such principles as `` the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist -LRB- and -RRB- the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including an independent state.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says there should be a universal, comprehensive health care program for all, not just the elderly, `` no matter what their income.'' It would cover long-term care as well as services <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now leaves uncovered, and it would be administered by the federal government and `` paid for by earmarked health taxes and general revenues.'' Most hospitals and other institutions would remain private, providing services under contract with the federal government at regulated fees. By emphasizing prevention, it could actually be cheaper than what Americans now pay, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> claims.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> calls himself `` a true peace candidate,'' and boasts that he is the only Democrat who opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and his bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. He also favors ending the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military build-up in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. He proposes to save $ 40 billion by not building two new aircraft carrier task forces, and `` tens of billions of dollars'' by negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets. He opposes building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber, the Trident D-5 missile, or any more MX missiles. He opposes deployment of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, and wants to halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop maneuvers in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` We must fight back against runaway corporations. Tax subsidies which aid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to invest abroad must be eliminated,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has proposed borrowing with federal guarantees 10 percent of the $ 600 billion assets of public pension funds to create an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for development projects. He says American business needs a new code of conduct, tougher anti-trust laws and tax incentives to invest in new plants and equipment. He would shift federal research and development funds from the military to civilian uses, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` making what the world is n't buying.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would require advance warning of plant closures and making business pay `` a fair share of the costs of dislocation.'' He supports equal pay for jobs of comparable worth _ a key issue for women _ and wants to raise the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage to $ 4.65 and then index it to the growth of average wages.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s anti-drug crusade, the centerpiece of his campaign, calls for increased <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> funding to stop the influx of drugs. He would offer drug-producing countries substitute crops to replace drug crops and tie cooperation to trade and foreign policy decisions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FARMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` We need a moratorium on family farm foreclosures,'' says <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He would shift the focus of federal programs to family farmers and help producers of raw commodities `` band together to become their own processors'' and cut out the middlemen. He charges that four corporations control 80 percent of the grain trade, and five companies hold 58 percent of the beef industry.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would double the $ 21 billion federal education budget to boost aid for college students and provide `` full funding for compensatory, bilingual and special education programs,'' as well as Head Start, which now serves only a third of eligible children.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would guarantee annual cost-of-living raises for Social Security recipients and leave the program `` out of the budget debate -LRB- to -RRB- stop striking fear into the hearts of our seniors.''

<HEAD>Jews Find Fewer Soviet Obstacles To Passover Celebrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jews are celebrating Passover with an abundance of matzoh, the ancient symbol of freedom that is more available in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this year. Other changes since last Passover include a modest expansion of Jewish culture, limited availability of some kosher foods and visits by Soviet Jews to relatives abroad. Many of the capital's 200,000 Jews have been flocking to the main synagogue to buy the thin, cracker-like unleavened bread eaten during the eight-day commemoration of the freeing of the ancient Hebrews from slavery in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Several Jews making purchases in the dark lobby of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Choral Synagogue said matzoh is not as difficult to obtain as it has been in the past. `` Times have become easier with glasnost,'' said <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>, 26, referring to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of more openness on some issues. `` Under -LRB- former Soviet leader Leonid I. -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, people gathering in large groups around the synagogue waiting to buy matzoh were driven away.'' Earlier years also saw matzoh shortages. `` There were deficit problems with flour. Now, everything is OK,'' said an elderly man who carried a rectangular package of matzoh. Several afternoons before the start of the holiday at sundown Friday, a steady stream of customers bought matzoh wrapped in white or brown paper marked `` Kosher for Passover'' in Russian and Hebrew. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korzhenevich </PERSON>, one of the synagogue's two rabbis, acknowledged in an interview that the government did n't provide enough flour for matzoh from 1965-1969 but said this year's allotment of 135 tons satisfied the demand Trucks made deliveries daily to the synagogue from what <PERSON> Korzhenevich </PERSON> calls a `` matzoh bakery,'' a tiny two-story, pre-revolutionary brown building in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The chief matzoh maker, <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaskin </PERSON>, gave a reporter a tour of the bakery, tucked behind apartment buildings and across the street from a popular cooperative restaurant. `` We've been producing matzoh here for 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Spaskin </PERSON>, a small gray-haired man of 38. The bakery already had stopped production for the year, and its stainless steel mixers and dough-rolling tables lay idle. <PERSON> Spaskin </PERSON> said he recently compared his product with American matzoh. The American matzoh `` was more airy,'' he said. `` It would be interesting to know the technology Americans use, or maybe it's a different flour.'' Aside from abundant matzoh supplies, the government has allowed these improvements in Jewish life since last Passover: _ <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Jews sent in some Kosher wine, chickens and salami Religious books also have been imported. _ A Jewish museum and library have been set up in private <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartments _ Last year, as relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> improved, more than 8,000 Soviet Jews were permitted to leave the country, nearly eight times as many as the year before and the highest total since 1981 Among those who have left in recent months are longtime Jewish activists and refuseniks <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Slepak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noam </PERSON> <PERSON> Meiman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> and pianist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltsman </PERSON>. Soviet authorities also are allowing increased numbers of Jews to travel to the West to visit relatives. In an exchange with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Jewish community, American Rabbi <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Selter </PERSON> are scheduled to lead Passover services in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Choral Synagogue on Friday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Choral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION>'s chief rabbi, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayevich </PERSON>, will be in the pulpit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. And there are more subtle signs of change. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, the 28-year-old son of Chicago-born refusenik <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, said he and a group of six friends meet daily in the Choral Synagogue to study the Talmud, the writings on Jewish civil and religious law. `` Two to four years ago, you had to be quite careful about where you prayed or studied. You could have an unexpected visit by the militia,'' he said. Still, problems remain. Thousands of Jews are waiting to leave. And anti-Semitism persists: a Soviet newspaper this week accused <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s other synagogue of brainwashing Jewish children into wanting to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the word `` No!'' was scrawled in English next to a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> on an outside wall of the matzoh bakery.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Passes Budget Plan Following Reagan's Priorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A big boost for the space program along with cuts in aid to local and state governments are contained in the $ 1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The plan, closer to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s priorities than the budget passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, was approved 18-3 on Wednesday and sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for consideration. Committee chairman <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the panel's senior Republican, drafted the bipartisan compromise and it sailed through the committee in a single day There's even an outside chance <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will meet its April 15 deadline for final budget action, although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does n't plan to vote on the resolution until after next week's holiday recess. But opponents and supporters complained that while they were living up to the terms of last fall's deficit reduction agreement with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the result was to put off much-needed fiscal reforms until next year. `` We need to get this out and then start showing what the problems are going to be,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., said it was mostly a plan to `` get past the November election. `` There's an old saying, ` No guts, no glory,''' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. `` And this is a no-glory budget.'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, voted against the plan. Total deficit reduction in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget proposal would be $ 7.2 billion, accomplished in part by holding spending on most programs short of the full inflation increases they would normally get. More than half the saving would come from selling off government assets. It would meet the $ 136 billion deficit-reduction target of the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law only because the committee decided to use optimistic White House economic projections. The non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> predicts a deficit more than $ 30 billion higher. Last fall's pact with the president set overall spending limits of $ 294 billion, $ 16.1 billion for foreign aid and $ 169.2 billion for domestic spending other than Social Security and entitlement programs. The agreement also included $ 14 billion in new taxes that were enacted last year and will be in effect for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget envisions spending $ 13 billion of the domestic allocation on space and science in the year beginning Oct. 1, about the same amount <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested and nearly $ 1 billion more than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved. In addition to the 27 percent increase for the space program, that money would boost <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> programs by 11 percent and move ahead the proposed construction of a giant physics project known as the superconducting super collider. Like the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee declined to kill any programs, relying instead on across-the-board spending restraint to reach deficit-reduction targets without making those tough choices in an election year. But while most programs would get at least a partial inflation boost, community and regional development would be cut $ 100 million from last year's $ 5.8 billion last year. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, said aid to localities has been cut too deeply already during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` The priorities of this thing are out of whack,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. A Republican amendment to carry out some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to eliminate those development programs was withdrawn, and <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> was defeated when he tried to require selling off two federally owned oil tracts, and said that, `` Sooner or later, we're going to have to get rid of some programs.'' But it was, <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said, still a `` a fair, balanced budget.'' The proposal would, like the administration and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budgets, call for big increases in spending on AIDS research, air traffic safety and education. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan assumes that if legislation providing catastrophic health insurance for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> recipients is approved, there will be an accompanying increase in premiums to cover the cost. An additional $ 500 million would be provided to continue supplying cheese and other surplus commodities to the needy. Like the president's budget, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would grant 4.3 percent pay raises for the military and 2 percent for civilian federal workers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted a 3 percent across-the-board pay hike.

<HEAD>March Farm Price Index Up 10 Percent From Last Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lettuce prices bounced up again in March but did n't approach their winter peaks, and the farm prices of cattle eggs and broilers were up, too. But the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says this month's farm prices for hogs, milk, wheat and sweet corn were down, and that left the March index where it was in February. Even so, the March average of prices received by farmers was up 7.4 percent from a year ago, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` The price of lettuce increased sharply from February to March but was well below record levels during the November through January 1988 period,'' the report said. `` Calf prices dropped slightly from February to March but were at the second highest level since June of 1979.'' Prices of cattle sold for beef were the highest since May 1979, the report said. Hog and wheat prices declined from February, while corn prices rose slightly. Department economists say net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion this year, down from the record level of $ 57 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. According to the preliminary March figures, based mostly on mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was up 0.9 percent from February and averaged 10 percent more than a year ago. Commercial vegetable prices rose 11 percent from last month but were down 7.1 percent from March 1987. `` Higher prices for lettuce and tomatoes were major contributors to the increase in the -LRB- vegetable -RRB- index,'' the report said. Lettuce prices were reported at $ 21.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.10 in February and $ 35.60 in January. The index for livestock and livestock products was down 0.7 percent from February but was 4.2 percent above March 1987. Prices were higher for cattle, eggs and broilers but were lower for hogs and milk. March farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same as in February. A year ago the March index was 121 percent. No new figures for farm production costs were included in the report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of budget cutbacks. In January, however, farm expenses were unchanged from last fall but averaged 4.4 percent above a year earlier. The next quarterly figures will be reported in April. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 68.40 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 67.40 in February and the $ 59.30 reported for March 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 41.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 45.80 in March and $ 47.40 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 1.84 a bushel, was up from $ 1.83 in February and the average of $ 1.47 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 2.64 per bushel, compared with $ 2.79 in February and $ 2.57 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 8.46 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 8.97 in February and $ 3.62 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 5.93 per bushel, compared with $ 5.97 in February and $ 4.73 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 56.9 cents per pound, compared with 56.8 in February and 47.5 cents in March 1987 _ Eggs were 50.8 cents per dozen, compared with 46.9 cents in February and 54.4 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 12 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 12.30 in February and $ 12.50 a year earlier _ Broilers were 27.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 25.7 cents in February and 29.1 cents a year ago

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> says its producers should receive incentives from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to sell grain on the open market rather than have to forfeit it to the government when price support loans come due. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, association president, said Wednesday that wheat producers deserve the same kind of consideration given corn producers who are being allowed to keep their grain under federal price support for an additional year. That was a reference to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s announcement Tuesday that price support loans for some old-crop corn and sorghum will be extended a year longer than their normal maturity dates <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bayard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, wheat farmer, said in a statement released here that the association is `` seeking a way to encourage growers to settle their maturing loans'' by paying them off with generic certificates. The certificates are issued by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> as payment-in-kind under crop programs and can be exchanged for surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. If the price support loans are not repaid, a farmer must forfeit the grain to the CCC, which cancels the debt. Once the CCC takes over the grain, it must be moved into government storage. Much of the CCC wheat is currently being sold back into the market in weekly auctions. `` Since current estimates are that it costs the government at least 20 cents a bushel to move, store, catalog and exchange forfeited wheat through weekly auctions, our proposal wo n't cost anything extra and it will reduce some of the government's logistical problems,'' <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> said `` It has the added benefit of keeping wheat moving in the pipeline of our much-improved market.'' Besides, he said, grain farmers `` have a right to expect even-handed treatment'' from the department.

<HEAD>Teamsters Win Right To Try To Organize Coors Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has eliminated a rival in trying to unionize the once bitterly anti-union <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after organizing <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>'s newest brewery just two weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday awarded sole organizing rights to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' lead brewery at <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, less than 50 miles away from the new <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> facility at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> The labor federation ordered one of its veteran affiliates, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, to withdraw from its campaign to organize the same 3,200 <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> workers, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> had a much better chance of succeeding. The decision was an outgrowth of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' decision last October to reaffiliate their 1.6 million members with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. The union was expelled from the federation 30 years earlier on charges of corruption. A major factor in the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to readmit the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> was ending the expensive fights and membership raids that the two organizations constantly waged against each other. Many employers often were able to avoid collective bargaining altogether by playing one union against the other. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> last September had awarded the sole organizing rights at <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> to the Machinists. The Teamsters had challenged that ruling as soon as they were re-admitted to the federation last Nov. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, in the face of an intensive organizing effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> since early 1986, last August signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> ending a 10-year-old nationwide boycott of its beer by the labor movement. In exchange, the company agreed to forgo erecting the usual legal hurdles available to employers in opposing unions and allow an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> affiliate an unfettered attempt to organize its Golden work force. However, that was before the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> were back in the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. And Teamsters officials admitted they now have concerns now about how the Coors-AFL-CIO pact will hold up in the face of Wednesday's action `` We're elated,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Klare </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' 100,000-member brewery and soft drinks division `` But there's a lot to be found out yet. We've got to meet with Coors and determine if they accept the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> picked us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> had argued before an arbitrator picked by <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> that the Teamsters should give up the <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> effort based on last September's decision. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> countered they had an ongoing organizing campaign at <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> a year before the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> entered the picture and had gotten signatures on Teamster union cards from more than 30 percent of the workers at Golden. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, according to witnesses at the arbitration proceedings. `` It was a black-and-white case,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Saporta </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' director of organizing. `` We were there first and they did n't have a single card signed. We're also the predominant union in the industry. We have contracts at all 12 <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> breweries covering some 9,000 workers.'' Ms. <PERSON> Saporta </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> have another tactical advantage in that it also has union contracts representing employees of more than 180 local distributors of Coors' products nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> just last week ratified a new contract with <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> raising the base pay for brewery production workers from its current $ 16.50 an hour to $ 17.25 over the next three years. Just a week earlier, the union won a an organizing effort at <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>'s newest facility at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION> to represent its current work force of about 340 people, which is expected to grow to 550 by next January. `` That was one of the factors the arbitrator took into consideration,'' <PERSON> Klare </PERSON> said. `` Coors workers are averaging about $ 3.50 to $ 4 an hour less than our members. Seeing how fellow workers down the road are doing gives them a big incentive to come in.''

<TEXT>
 People who have been putting off writing letters may want to get busy before Sunday, when the cost of sending one rises to a quarter from 22 cents. The 14 percent increase in the price of first-class mail is less, however, than the 18 percent increase for mailing newspapers and magazines and the 25 percent increase for advertising mail. The rate increases, proposed last May, were designed to avoid continuing losses by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. The agency was more than $ 220 million in the red last year. Some 6 billion `` E'' stamps have been distributed to post offices across the nation to fill the gap until new 25-cent stamps can be printed. The new stamps, without any price on them, are good only for use within the country. They have no denomination because they had to be printed ahead of time, before officials knew what new rate would be approved by the indpendent <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has ordered post offices to extend their hours during the next two weeks to help in the changeover. Stamps are also being sold by mail and telephone. Phone orders, by credit card, can be made by calling 1-800-STAMP24. There is a $ 2 service charge. Here are some examples of the new rates: _ First-class letters: First ounce, 25 cents; additional ounces 20 cents Up from 22 cents and 17 cents. Presorted by ZIP code, 21 cents. Up from 18 cents. Presorted by carrier route, 19.5 cents. Up from 17 cents. _ First-class cards: Regular rate, 15 cents Up from 14 cents. Presorted by ZIP code, 13 cents. Up from 12 cents.

Up from 11 cents. _ Priority Mail: Range of $ 2.40 to $ 72.24, unchanged _ Express Mail: Range of $ 7.75 to $ 89.05 Down from range of $ 8.35 to $ 104.95. _ Second-class -LRB- periodicals -RRB-: Within county of publication, 9.4 cents per pound and 3.2 cents to 5.7 cents per piece Up from 9.1 cents per pound and 3.1 cents to 4.9 cents per piece. Outside county of publication: Regular rate, 12.4 cents to 30.2 cents per pound and 4.9 cents to 16.0 cents per piece.

<HEAD>Contras Said To Violate Truce; Holy Week Vacations Begin</HEAD>

 Contra rebels said they attacked Sandinista soldiers in two areas of the country in violation of a temporary truce that is to be expanded into a 60-day cease-fire on Friday. But the rebels' chief field commander said on Wednesday he supports the peace accord with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government that brought the truce. The two sides have not yet agreed on logistics of the cease-fire, during which the roughly 10,000 Contra fighters are to move into five zones while a lasting peace agreement is negotiated. Talks resume Tuesday. A transcript of a Wednesday broadcast by the rebels' Honduras-based Radio September 15 said rebels attacked in <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> province along the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast and in the central province of <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> province It did not say when. `` Nicaraguan Resistance commandos cause casualties to the pro-Soviet army,'' the transcript quoted the broadcast as saying. The pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> quoted military sources as saying Contras killed four civilians and kidnapped two on Saturday in the central province of Chontales. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday it had no reports of combat. Other reports have indicated rebels opposed to the cease-fire agreement were staging attacks. However, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the chief Contra military field commander, said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that he supports the peace accord and will comply with it, despite his reservations. He has said he does n't trust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` We understand there can be differences, but during negotiations we have to have a single position,'' he told a news conference. In talks Monday and Tuesday, representatives of the government and the U.S.-backed Contras agreed on the general locations of five zones where the Contras are to begin gathering Friday. But they did not further define the areas or work out the mechanics of how the rebels will move into the zones. The preliminary peace accord signed March 23 in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> says the rebels may accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, during the period. But it does not say if they must lay down their weapons, an issue that is expected to come up in the technical meeting in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on Tuesday or in a meeting of high-ranking representatives of both sides in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a $ 48 million package of humanitarian aid for the Contras and for children injured in the fighting. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was to consider the measure today and there was a chance it could be law before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for Easter recess. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras expired Feb. 29 and Contra leaders said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s failure to secure them continued military support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> contributed to their decision to sign the peace accord. The six-year war was secondary in the minds of most Nicaraguans this week. Banks, government offices, stores and most restaurants closed for Holy Week vacations and residents headed for <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast beaches or other resort spots. Many first had to search for gasoline which is in short supply. La Prensa, the opposition newspaper, stopped publishing for the week, citing a shortage of Soviet-supplied newsprint. The two government papers printed their last edition for the week on Wednesday. State-run television planned special broadcasts, including the films `` Jesus of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>'' and `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hur </PERSON>.'' Movie theaters in the capital were showing `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>,'' `` The Godfather,'' `` The Deer Hunter,'' `` Amadeus,'' and `` Chariots of Fire,'' all with Spanish subtitles.

<HEAD>Agenda Cites Shultz-Weinberger Opposition To Iran-Contra Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Documents just released by the congressional Iran-Contra committees include a handwritten note offering new evidence that Cabinet-level opposition to the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms deal was on the agenda of a January 1986 meeting attended by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president has maintained he was not aware of the concerns of then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> until much later. Had he been aware of their objections, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said, he might have advised the president against the sale. `` When you do n't know something, it's hard to react. We were not in the loop,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last August. Among documents released Wednesday was an agenda penned by then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> for his Jan. 17, 1986, briefing of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It includes an item that states `` <ORGANIZATION> Shultz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> still recommend against.'' The agenda also states that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the late CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> `` approve,'' and lists a `` new finding'' _ or document to authorize the covert arms sales. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the document that day. The scrawled 26-word agenda is marked `` Done'' at the top. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in January said this of the meeting: `` The president may have signed a finding but there was no discussion of a finding in front of me. I do not recall any suggestion of a finding that day.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintains that specific details were not discussed in the briefing, which he considered to be an informal session, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today, citing an unidentified aide to the vice president contacted Wednesday. The newspaper noted that a memo released earlier and related to the same meeting stated that `` the secretaries do not recommend you proceed with this plan.'' That memo, prepared for the president, carried a <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> notation that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been briefed orally and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was among those present. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is among those under indictment in the Iran-Contra affair.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, answering critics who say he lacks the government experience to be president, says `` Some leaders do n't hold office.'' The Democratic presidential candidate also accused fellow hopeful <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of personal attacks on him, a day after <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lacked the qualifications for the presidency. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> returned to a site of his activism last year to emphasize Wednesday that his personal style of leadership has been in the streets, not in the government halls. `` Leadership stands with the people in the time of crisis,'' he told about a 1,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here late Wednesday. `` I stood with the people ... I stood with the P-40 workers in <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON>.'' Almost exactly a year ago _ on <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> Sunday 1987 _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> marched in the streets of this <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb to protest management's actions in the strike of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> local at the <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> meatpacking plant here. Workers went on strike on Jan. 4, 1987, and are still out. Replacement workers have been hired, but the company, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to reoganize under the backruptcy laws. `` In your time of crisis, you called out to me and I responded,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd. `` In the time of this nation's crisis, I want to be your president and I need your help. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began a three-day <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> campaign swing Wednesday after a day of private meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with key leaders of the party's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> establishment and with campaign aides. He planned a full day of campaigning across the state both today and Saturday. `` Some officeholders are leaders. Some leaders do n't hold office,'' he said. `` But leaders stand with the people in the hour of hardship and challenge.'' On Tuesday, fellow <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> attacked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for lacking the requisite experience to be president, and criticized his foreign policy views. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he viewed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s comments as `` attacks, which were more personal than principled.'' The two were to meet, but it fell through. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, told of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remark, asked: `` Is there supposed to be some unwritten rule why <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can not be criticized, why his positions have to be just sacrosanct and nobody can say anything about them for fear somebody will just misinterpret what you're saying? <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not refer to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> directly in his speech, but he did tell reporters that he will lay his differences with the other candidates as appropriate. `` If there are distinctions, I will discuss them,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He emphasized that he wanted to keep his message positive and pledged not to engage in personal attacks. But <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, told reporters on the plane that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> `` is the Democratic bully'' who has attacked other candidates before. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> derided <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> for saying complimentary things about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a Monday debate and then criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the next day. `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> does n't deserve your attention or ours until he starts winning some votes _ or at least breaks into double digits,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s recently poor showing in primaries. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech at the Cudahy church laid out more specifically than before his definition of leadership. `` I have learned to lead in the gap ... the leadership gap in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the Executive Office building,'' he said. `` When the drugs flow into our country, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> just says no. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just says nothing. Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does nothing. `` I led the drive to ban drugs and to ban guns,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> listed a variety of his previous actions as demonstrations of leadership. He mentioned his `` standing with the auto workers at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>'' <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> closed a plant shortly after promising to keep it open for several more years. He talked of standing with family farmers at foreclosure sales. He talked of his leadership in the fight against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in personally asking Soviet leaders to improve human rights in that nation. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refered to his campaign as featuring `` a clear message and an authentic leader who speaks directly to the people.''

<HEAD>Iran Boosts Fuel Imports As Tanker War Takes Its Toll</HEAD>

 Iraqi air raids on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refineries and tankers in recent weeks appear to be taking an increasing toll on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s vital oil industry as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war escalates sharply. Shipping analysts believe the Iraqis will intensify air strikes aimed at throttling <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil exports while hammering <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other cities in a drive to pressure <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the negotiating table. `` We ca n't see an end to the tanker war,'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramheim </PERSON> of the Oslo-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We had hoped the tanker war was coming to an end after a recent lull, but the situation is worse now than it's been for a long time. You think it's reached a peak, and then it just gets worse,'' he said in a phone interview. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, one of the world's major oil producers, is having to import record amounts of refined petroleum products, such as kerosene and jet fuel, the Middle East Economic Survey reported this week. `` This unprecedented sudden import of gas oil could be due to damage inflicted on Iranian refineries because of the war,'' the respected oil industry newsletter noted. But it noted as well that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> may also be `` taking precautionary measures and stocking up these products in anticipation of a further escalation in the war.'' The sudden surge in refined imports has strategic implications in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war It coincides with an unprecedented Iraqi missile bombardment of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other key cities over the last month. The Iranians may fear their battered refineries could be knocked out altogether. The Economic Survey, a weekly published in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the Iranians have chartered a 200,000-ton tanker from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Marimpex trading company to deliver a full load of gas oil _ more than 2 million barrels _ from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> next month The Iranians have already taken delivery of nearly 3 million 42-gallon barrels of gas oil in recent weeks, industry sources noted. That is a massive increase over the 300,000 barrels a day it has been importing for the last 18 months. Recent Iraqi air raids have reduced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s domestic refining capacity by as much as one-third. A large formation of Iraqi fighter-bombers attacked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s big <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal in the northern end of the gulf on March 19, badly damaging two of the estimated 25 tankers that shuttle oil to makeshift terminals farther south for transshipment to delivery tankers. The 316,379-ton Avaj and the 249,829-ton <LOCATION> Sanandaj </LOCATION> were left in flames with 50 crewmen killed. Shipping sources said both vessels were so badly hit they will likely be scrapped. The loading facilities on <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>, heavily defended by anti-aircraft missile batteries, also were damaged, the economic survey said. The main systems on the west of the island were knocked out in the bombing, forcing the Iranians to switch loading to a smaller jetty, slowing down exports that are <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main source of revenue for its war effort. Several other shuttle tankers, either owned by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or chartered by it, are believed to have been put out of action in recent <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air strikes. `` The Iraqis are the key,'' stressed <PERSON> Ramheim </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now they're attacking again, we think the situation's going to get worse because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> always retaliates.'' Because <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s gulf ports have been closed since the early days of the war, the Iranians have to take revenge by attacking neutral ships. After <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported three air strikes on Iranian tankers, Iranian gunboats on Monday attacked a Danish supertanker and a Norwegian-operated tanker, setting both ablaze. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> says 4.7 million tons of shipping has been sunk or written off since December because of the tanker war. That includes the 280,000-ton Iranian tanker Susangird, which went down after it was set on fire by Iraqi Exocet missiles, killing 21 crewmen. Altogether, about 15 million tons of shipping has been lost since 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies reported. That's more than half the 24 million tons of merchant shipping sunk in World War II. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must ship its oil exports through the gulf, where its tankers are prey to marauding Iraqi jets. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> exports its oil through pipelines across neighboring <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> which are far less vulnerable to attack.

<TEXT>
 A fired truck weight inspector, who was so large the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> weighed him on a truck scale, got his state job back and the patrol got a scolding for being biased against fat people. The state <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> unanimously ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s weight had not affected his work and that he was discriminated against when <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> fired him July 31. The board ordered that <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, 48, receive back pay, which his lawyer said totaled about $ 15,000. When he was fired, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> weighed 463 pounds, according to testimony. State Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON>, chairman of the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the importance the patrol placed on <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s weight was discriminatory because it was not related to his job performance. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said the patrol would appeal the ruling. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a truck weight inspector since 1977, lost his job at a weigh station near the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> border where he weighed trucks and inspected cargo. A letter to <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> listed his lack of control over his weight, his inability to wear agency uniforms and his body odor as reasons for his dismissal. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> did not attend the three-hour hearing Wednesday `` because everybody wanted to see how big he was,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutsman </PERSON>. `` His appearance would have only served to satisfy curiosity.'' <PERSON> Stutsman </PERSON> refused to give <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s current weight, putting it somewhere between 320 and 463 pounds. The patrol once weighed <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> on a truck scale, according to testimony at the hearing. The action was dehumanizing and showed `` a shocking lack of sensitivity and crass attitude on the part of Mr. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s supervisor,'' said state Personnel Division analyst <ORGANIZATION> Bonny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fetch </ORGANIZATION>, who recommended <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s full reinstatement The board's decision underscores that no state employee can be dismissed for a weight problem unless weight standards are necessary to do the job, Fetch said.

<HEAD>Education Department Says Smaller Classes Will Worsen Teacher
Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Education Department study says the workload for secondary school teachers has `` never been lighter'' and efforts to reduce class size in hopes of spurring student achievement are probably misguided. The study released Wednesday estimated it could cost up to $ 69 billion a year and require the hiring of 1 million new teachers to reduce the typical class size from 24 to 15 students. It suggested school reformers look for ways to help teachers do a better job of managing the children in their classrooms rather than `` sink vast sums'' into efforts to reduce class size. The report, `` Class Size and Public Policy: Politics and Panaceas,'' said efforts to boost students' test scores through smaller classes `` will probably be a waste of money and effort.'' The report was based on a review of past studies, not on any new classroom research. There now are 24 pupils in the typical public elementary school classroom, down from 30 in 1961. In secondary schools, the typical class size is down from 27 to 22. The report by <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and Improvement said, `` Smaller classes will worsen the shortage of both teachers and classrooms.'' `` If teachers today believe that the number of students per class is too large and their workload too heavy, it is also true that the number of students they teach has never been fewer and, from that standpoint, their workload has never been lighter,'' it said. The report noted several states, including <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, have made smaller class size in the early grades a key ingredient of their school reform efforts. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of education in charge of research, said lowering class size has become `` an ersatz reform goal around the country.'' `` There are a lot of better and less costly things you can do and get results,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said in an interview. `` There's no question that good teachers in tiny classes are one of the reasons people pay for expensive private schools. But it's not a very prudent investment strategy if you're trying to improve the vast enterprise of American education.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the 1.85 million-member teachers union, has a policy that states, `` excellence in the classroom can best be attained by small class size,'' and it urges affiliates to `` seek an optimum class size of 15 students.'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, said in an interview: `` It is very expensive to lower it to 15, but they continually use this rationale for doing nothing. We have elementary teachers out there sitting with 38, 40, 42 kids in their class. That's the sad part.'' He said <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have some of the most crowded classrooms. `` We've got to move to less than 20-to-1 in the early elementary grades if we're ever going to expect to reach these kids so we do n't have to spend all the money on remediation when they get into junior and senior high school,'' <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said. The report, however, emphasized that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has achieved the world's highest math achievement scores with math classes that average 41 pupils. It said reducing the size of the typical class from 24 to 23 pupils would require 73,000 more teachers and cost $ 5 billion, `` not counting the expenses of building more classrooms.'' A reduction to 20 students would require 335,000 new teachers and cost $ 22.8 billion. Although teacher salaries average $ 26,500 nationally plus fringes and benefits, the study estimated the overall cost of each new teacher at $ 68,295.

<TEXT>
 More than 800 Chinese students studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have signed their names to an open letter opposing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy to sharply reduce the number of students abroad, a student organizer said today. `` We have had an overwhelming response from fellow students across the country,'' said <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> <PERSON> Minxin </PERSON>, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's been a mixture of shock, anger and action.'' At a meeting late Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, about 300 Chinese students shouted down a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> consular official who came from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to explain the policy, said two <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It was democracy in action,'' one source said. The letter, which appeared in Chinese-language newspapers across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the policy would hurt <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s drive to modernize its economy. `` The recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseas study are fundamentally in conflict with the declared national policy of reform and open door,'' read the letter, which was translated by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The policy will also force many Chinese students in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before obtaining their degrees, the letter said. The document was accompanied by the names and phone numbers of 21 Chinese students and a request for student supporters to add their names to the list. By early today, more than 800 students had done so, <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. Currently, about 40,000 Chinese students are studying abroad, 27,000 of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last year, 8,000 students came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Under the new policy, only 600 Chinese would be sent to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news reports, an official document seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students who quoted government officials. Time limits on students studying abroad would also be imposed, said the document, which was obtained from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources. That rule could be particularly difficult for many Chinese, who need time to master a foreign language before studying their specialty. A spokesman at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> acknowledged Wednesday that fewer students would be sent abroad, but denied there has been a policy change. At the <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> meeting, the unidentified consular official confirmed that a time limit had been placed on studies, the sources said. `` He said we have two years to do a masters -LRB- degree -RRB- and four or five to get our Ph.D.,'' one source said. The policy is the result of a struggle between Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> backs an `` open-door policy'' and increasingly liberal economic reform. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a Soviet-educated engineer, wants to limit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s contact with the West, and is concerned that Chinese students studying abroad are becoming too Westernized, Ms. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. When Chinese students come home, she said, `` they are already infected by the political values of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They absorb Western political ideas and that could be troublesome for the Chinese state.'' At <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, the official told students that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has felt the need for more control over its students since January 1987, when more than 1,000 Chinese nationals in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> signed an open letter to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> opposing conservative policies in their homeland, the sources said. At that point a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> student jumped up and yelled, `` Control? What do you mean by control. What kind of word is that?'' the sources said. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Longxi </PERSON>, a 40-year-old doctoral candidate at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not see the letter as a political statement. `` It is a bread-and-butter issue for me,'' he said. `` I need time to study comparative literature.'' `` We are only asking that the right to study and complete our degrees be restored to us,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said.

 The opposition today accused the government of concealing massive corruption involving hundreds of millions of dollars and demanded former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> be questioned about missing funds. The country's two main opposition parties claimed the government had limited the scope of a probe into alleged corruption by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, charging information about the <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> family's activities was being `` The government has orchestrated another cover-up and fooled the people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> charged. The Party for Peace and Democracy demanded President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be questioned about allegations of widespread corruption under his government and called for a full investigation. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denied there was any attempt to cover up corruption and said it was determined to expose any official wrongdoing. The former president's brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was charged early today with embezzling $ 10.4 million as head of Saemaul Undong -LRB- New Community -RRB-, a semi-official development program. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who was taken to a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> prison in handcuffs, also was charged with taking bribes, influence peddling, evading taxes and violation of business, land and construction laws. If convicted under special laws covering massive public fraud, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> could receive a sentence ranging from 10 years in prison to death. Ten other people, including aides of the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and senior <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION> officials, also were indicted on embezzlement, bribery, influence peddling and corruption charges, officials said. The other suspects include <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>'s two brothers-in-law. The opposition charged that the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his associates had embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars, and the government was concealing evidence to prevent a political backlash. Chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-il </PERSON> said the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> amassed a fortune in money, land and stocks by using government and family connections during the seven years he headed <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON>. The former president had appointed him to the post. `` It is agonizing to me that I have caused trouble to my brother,'' the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> was quoted as saying by prosecutors. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> diverted government and <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> funds, pressured corporations into making illegal donations, arranged to get private businesses government contracts and permits, and misappropriated land and buildings built with government funds. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said the investigation was centering on charges <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> diverted huge sums of money overseas for land speculation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The prosecutor said the probe was continuing and further revelations were expected. <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> was founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> resigned as its chief in 1987 after being linked to gangsters. Prosecutors are questioning government officials about charges they aided or concealed <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> corruption to protect the former president and his family. Former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who left office Feb. 25 after seven years in power, has not been implicated in the Saemaul affair. He is on a private American tour and met last week with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 Several of the largest insurance companies are offering sharp discounts in premiums for drivers of cars with air bags, the safety devices that inflate and protect a driver in a serious accident. <ORGANIZATION> USAA </ORGANIZATION>, the country's sixth largest insurance company, announced Wednesday a premium discount of up to 60 percent for personal injury and medical coverage for air bag-equipped cars.

 A dispute between government agencies over the questions to be asked on the 1990 Census has been settled, before Friday's deadline for reporting to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that it had settled its differences with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> over how many households would receive the longer, more detailed form to obtain the national head count. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> had wanted to reduce paperwork by deleting some questions and reducing the number of people who get the more complex long form. The two agencies have agreed that all 106 million households in the nation will be sent the short form, while the more detailed long form will go to 17.7 million. Census had wanted to sent it to nearly 20 million households, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> to limit it to 10 million. Short form questions on plumbing facilities and condominiums will be switched to the long form, as <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> suggested. But other questions will be retained, including the cost of uilities. Some things that were asked in the 1980 census will be dropped in 1990. These include employment five years earlier, marital history, weeks spent looking for work, number of bathrooms, air conditioning and heating equipment, presence of an elevator and type of fuel used for cooking and heating water.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to halt sales of lawn darts, following a federal complaint about the potentially dangerous sports items, according to the Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> agreed in a consent decree to stop selling lawn darts within a week, the commission said Wedenesday.

Lawn darts are an outdoor game in which large, pointed darts are tossed at targets on the ground. They can pose a serious hazard, with three deaths reported in the last 18 years and an estimated 670 annual injuries, the safety agency said.

<HEAD>`21st Century Medicine' Finding New Ways To Test, Manage Stress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Someday, doctors will have a system for identifying stress-plagued patients who are headed for heart trouble even though their blood pressure readings may look normal, says a heart researcher. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, a cardiovascular researcher from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, told cardiologists meeting in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this week that new ways of testing can identify `` hot reactors'' _ stressed but seemingly healthy people. `` These are people who fight saber-toothed tigers 30, 40 times a day and do n't even know it,'' <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION>. `` A doctor ca n't tell from resting blood pressure -LRB- tests taken at rest -RRB-,'' he said, adding that conventional blood pressure readings do n't tell how much blood is pumping or how much resistance the heart is fighting. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, director of the cardiovascular institute at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, has worked 10 years on ways to measure the rapid, stress-induced fluctuations in the cardiovascular system That work, he said, has yielded a 30-minute test using devices to monitor heart performance, blood pressure and other factors to find `` hot reactors,'' who apparently make up more than 10 percent of the population. With so many seemingly healthy people at risk of illness, within three to eight months in some cases, he said, `` I think it's worth testing in people.'' <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> and his colleagues plan to expand their efforts to three other locations next year. Someday soon, he hopes, physicians will agree on a standard way of conducting such stress tests. `` We have a model,'' he said. `` It's been successful.'' Those efforts are part of what <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> terms `` a new kind of medicine,'' emphasizing not just technical medical techniques, but beneficial lifestyle adjustments. Some, he noted, have called it `` medicine from the 21st century _ teaching people what they can do for themselves.'' `` Drugs and surgery are not sufficient for most people'' with cardiovascular problems, said Dr. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON>, an assistant professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Preventative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Cardiology has tended to ignore the role of the brain on the heart,'' <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> said.

 The grandson of a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> football coach has been charged with stealing a missing page of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s notes from a locked display case at the school, police said. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>, 18, was arrested Wednesday evening at his <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> apartment, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a university police lieutenant. The page of handwritten notes, owned by the university, was reported missing last week from a locked glass case on the fourth floor of the <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flawn </PERSON> Academic Center. It was among six pages on display from a series addressing the mathematical concept of Euclidean rotation. Investigators said a telephoned tip led them to the younger Royal's apartment Tuesday where the page was found in a photo album, along with photographs of his grandfather, <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>' football coach from 1957 through 1976. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> is not a university student. His father, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, is a custodian on the same floor of the academic center where the display case was located. According to a court affidavit, a woman named <PERSON> Alissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who also lives at the apartment where the page was discovered, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> `` walked in and flashed some papers in front of my face and said, ` These are the writings of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>.''' Police could not immediately offer an explanation for the theft. The display case was locked and the glass unbroken when the document was discovered missing. The missing page is part of an archive of 60 or 70 pages `` upon which <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> wrote the notes representing his thinking as he was trying to work out his theories near the end of his life,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON>, librarian for <ORGANIZATION> UT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ransom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The university has owned the papers for 25 years. <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> apparently wrote the notes several years before he died in 1955. Although the page likely could have been sold for a couple of thousand dollars, <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> said, its value far exceeds that amount. `` For all of us, it's a piece of our heritage, and it is not to be replaced. In that sense, it has no price,'' <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>, who is special assistant to the president of the university, did not return a telephone call to his <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> residence on Wednesday.

 <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, wife of opera impresario Sir <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, was arrested outside <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> for failing to appear in court on charges she slapped an executive of a performing arts management company. The arrest on 57th Street on Wednesday was the latest in a series of legal entanglements for the couple. <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, 48, has been visiting <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office frequently, often with her 86-year-old husband, according to police She was apparently upset that her husband, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera from 1950 to 1972, had been dropped from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>' board of directors, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> represents classical music artists and produces classical concerts. Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> was arrested on a bench warrant issued after she failed to appear in court Monday to answer charges of criminal trespass and harassment, according to Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>. The charges were filed last month by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinones </PERSON>, vice president for administration at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>, who claimed that <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> entered her office without permission, harassed her and slapped her face. Why Lady <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> returned to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s offices Wednesday was not known, <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Quinones </PERSON> and her attorney, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Steckler </PERSON>, refused to comment on the arrest. Shortly after the Bings' wedding 14 months ago, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Blyn </PERSON> declared that <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> suffered from Alzheimer's disease and was unable to control his $ 900,000 estate.

A pretrial hearing on the annulment proceedings is set for May 3. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said last year that he loved his wife and that he believed allegations by longtime friends that she was misspending his money were wrong. <PERSON> Blyn </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> not to take her husband out of the court's jurisdiction. However, she took him to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the West Indian island of <LOCATION> Anguilla </LOCATION>.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official has admitted that he waited months before telling prosecutors about his alleged attempt to offer a $ 200,000 bribe to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, former vice chairman of the defunt <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor, says prosecutors did n't ask him about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and he did n't volunteer the information. A prosecutor, however, objected to defense attorney <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorosa </PERSON>'s line of questioning Wednesday at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six others. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> explained, with the jury out of the room, that prosecutors in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> were barred from inquiring about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> because he was then being investigated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> under the special prosecutor law. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been charged with any wrongdoing, although a special prosecutor continues to investigate his dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a local manufacturer that won millions of dollars in defense contracts. The attorney general's legal troubles have placed him under increasing pressure to step down, triggered in part by the resignation of some of his top aides earlier this week. Ms. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> also said the special prosecutor initially was investigating former White House aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, until last May. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted last month of illegal lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, his eldest son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, and the other co-defendants are accused of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise that paid bribes to public officials and others. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> is one of four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officers cooperating with the government in a bid for leniency. He has previously testified that he and former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> offered $ 200,000 to <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of the attorney general, `` to fix the case'' with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. He also said that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> never got back to them and the money never was paid. In his 12th day on the witness stand, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> admitted under prodding by <PERSON> Amorosa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s attorney, that he did not tell prosecutors about the bribe offer until at least August 1987, more than eight months after he and the other ex-Wedtech officers began cooperating with investigators. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, former <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> financial adviser <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, and another man have been indicted in a separate case, charged with allegedly taking payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other government officials.

 A government official today confirmed that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is replacing a research nuclear reactor. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> long has worried the reactor could be used in an atomic weapons development program. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuang-chi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the government <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was assisting in converting the reactor to a new system that would provide `` less possibility to produce plutonium,'' a key component in the production of atomic weapons. The comments were made one week after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration pressured <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to close the reactor and to stop work on a secret installation that could have processed the reactor's spent fuel to extract plutonium. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> had earlier confirmed that the research reactor at Lung Tan, 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, was closed in January but denied the move was made because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure. Today, however, he acknowledged that `` maybe there's some influence -LRB- from -RRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' behind the decision to replace the reactor, adding that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` did express its concern about our research.'' The energy official said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern over Lung Tan goes back many years and may partly be caused by reports that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> developed atomic weaponry using a reactor of the same design. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s position of not developing atomic bombs and said of the Lung Tan overhaul, `` Since we decided not to make -LRB- atomic -RRB- weapons, why not make them -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- happy?'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said the main reason for changing Lung Tan's design was to make it compatible with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s nuclear power reactors, which run on a different system. `` It's a major change, the reactor is completely changed,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. `` It is a very major task ... It is keeping everybody busy.'' He said the conversion would take at least two years, but he did not have a cost estimate. According to <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is providing technical help and will provide assistance in obtaining fuel for testing the new core. The Lung Tan reactor, which opened in 1973, has used heavy water to control the splitting of atomic nuclei, a system that can use natural uranium as fuel. The reactor is being converted to a `` light water'' system that requires enriched uranium fuel. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-lung </PERSON>, professor of physics of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the high-tech production of enriched uranium is limited to a few countries, making the fuel comparatively difficult to obtain and its use easier to monitor. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> can not make the enriched fuel. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> also stressed that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> does n't have facilities to process spent fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. When asked whether <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> had worked on a secret processing installation, he replied: `` Baloney.'' Still, local newspapers have been filled with reports that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government learned from a missing top-level Taiwanese nuclear researcher that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> had plans to make nuclear weapons. The media reports claim that Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-yi </PERSON>, former deputy director of the official <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, is working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and has moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since disappearing in January. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, who previously worked with <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, said he did not know where the missing official was or what had happened to him. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s nuclear policy is a particularly sensitive topic because Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> production of atomic weapons would be a reason for invading the island, which <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> views as a renengade province.

<TEXT>
 A young Irishwoman, critically injured in a St. Patrick's Day traffic accident while on a visit to her jailed boyfriend, emerged from a coma after prayers for her recovery, says a family spokesman. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> `` was conscious and a smile came to her face,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Archbold </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. The 22-year-old <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> woman's condition was upgraded from critical to fair. `` There's hope she will recover fully, but it's too early to say,'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>, nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Weiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, who was hit by a car March 17, was in a coma for 10 days. Her parents, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, visited her bedside daily, praying and hoping. <PERSON> Archbold </PERSON> attributed <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>'s improvement to prayer. `` We prayed hard for her,'' he said. `` There were special prayers during the Palm Sunday Mass at the center. Just shortly after the Mass was over, she started to regain consciousness. `` She recognized voices, but she has a long way to go,'' <PERSON> Archbold </PERSON> said. Her recovery will take a long time, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, another nursing supervisor. `` The fact that she has been up and talking is a very, very good sign,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>. A ventilator that helped Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> breathe has been removed, but she is still being fed intravenously, Mrs. <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> tries to talk, and mouths words. Mrs. <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> said she does not know if the young woman has mentioned <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a 21-year-old native of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> whom she met last year when he was there for a visit. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> last November, says the two fell in love. He is in the Cook County Jail on a charge of bludgeoning his landlord to death. If convicted, he could receive the death penalty. In addition to first-degree murder, he is charged with residential burglary, armed robbery, home invasion and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.

<BYLINE>Court Fight `Moot' As 18-Year-Old Woman Ends Pregnancy

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A divorcing couple's legal battle over their unborn child apparently ended when the 18-year-old woman underwent an abortion before she could be served with a court order blocking the procedure. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> ended her 8-week-old pregnancy over her estranged husband's objections in less than an hour Wednesday, between the time a district court allowed the procedure and the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> blocked it, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacnick </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state court system. The abortion was performed before the appellate court could serve Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> with papers reinstating a temporary restraining order vacated about an hour earlier by 3rd District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gacnik </PERSON> said. The appeals court had scheduled a Monday hearing to consider 25-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' appeal of <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s decision, but her husband's attorney said the hearing might be pointless if the fetus had been aborted. `` If the abortion has taken place, we're going to have to make some serious evaluation ... there's a pretty good argument that would make it moot,'' said the attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. Young issued the original restraining order last week, when he ruled that Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> could not have an abortion pending resolution of a divorce-related custody dispute involving a 10-month-old infant and the fetus. He vacated his own order on Wednesday when he accepted arguments by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorneys that a woman has a constitutional right to end her pregnancy. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said while <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> may have the right to be consulted about any abortion involving Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, she had the ultimate authority over whether to carry the fetus to term. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> acknowledged Mrs. <PERSON> Reynold </PERSON>'s right to privacy, but said her husband also had the right of procreation and that when the two clash, it is the courts which must decide who prevails. Later, while <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> filed an appeal to the appellate division, which reinstated the restraining order pending Monday's hearing, Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> drove off to have the abortion. `` Nobody wins _ no matter who wins,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` It's not my right or her right. I think the child's got a right of its own. It's a baby. It's got a mind. It ca n't talk, it ca n't walk, but it's got a right to be born.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> could not be located for comment Wednesday night. But television station <ORGANIZATION> KUTV </ORGANIZATION> quoted her as saying she would not comment on the abortion, saying `` that's too sensitive and personal a question.''

<HEAD>Bank Securities Bill Clears Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation granting bank holding companies broad new securities powers is heading into the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after getting an overwhelming endorsement in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Senators voted 94-2 Wednesday night to approve a bill that would permit the mingling of commercial and investment banking for the first time since the Depression. The legislation substantially revises restrictions on banks in the Glass-Steagall Act, passed in 1933 in reaction to abuses preceding the 1929 stock market crash. Proponents of change argued that developments in the financial system, particularly in the last decade, threaten the ability of banks to compete. Securities firms, for instance, offer bank-like services such as commercial paper and money market mutual funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would permit bank holding companies to underwrite and sell mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds immediately after the bill is approved by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who favors the bill. Bank holding companies would be allowed to underwrite and sell corporate bonds and mutual funds six months after enactment. A vote by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be required in 1991 before bank holding companies could underwrite corporate stock, the most lucrative securities activity. Wednesday evening's vote came after nearly six hours of debate in which <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., warded off amendments that could have unraveled the delicate compromise adopted on an 18-2 vote by his committee earlier this month The bill is seen as something of a swan song for <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who retires next year after more than 30 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Just before its adoption, it was named the Proxmire Financial Modernization Act of 1988. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest industry group pushing for the bill's passage, praised it as benefiting consumers `` This should accelerate the momentum for enlightened financial reform legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is split into many factions. Its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, has released a proposal that would grant banks only a few securities powers _ commercial paper, mortgage revenue bonds and asset-backed securities _ and places more restrictions on banks. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> said bankers would work in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to defeat limits on banks' insurance activities, but his industry faces tougher going there than it did in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. One provision of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would require banks to prove they are meeting the needs of poor citizens and neighborhoods before getting permission to exercise the new powers authorized in the bill. Another prohibits misleading savings account advertisements, and another requires lenders to disclose terms of home equity loans.

 A former public guardian, convicted of stealing as much as $ 200,000 from mentally handicapped or elderly wards, may have to repay all the money, a prosecutor says. <ORGANIZATION> Multnomah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradshaw </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday found <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON>, 44, guilty of 12 counts of felony theft and 12 counts of official misconduct, a misdemeanor. Sentencing was set for May 24. <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON>, who was fired in October as the county's public guardian and conservator, was convicted after the defense and prosecution agreed to submit police reports as the only evidence. The agreement calls for Nizdil to repay the stolen money, but the exact amount was not set, defense attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. The total could be upwards of $ 200,000, said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. Each theft count carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Each misconduct count carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail. <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> remains free on his own recognizance pending sentencing. Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the state had not yet prepared a sentencing recommendation, but said the state had made no sentencing concessions in its agreement with <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> was indicted on 22 counts each of theft and misconduct. Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said there was evidence of additional thefts, but said that evidence will not be presented to a grand jury because of the agreement. Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said an investigation into <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON>'s conduct before his firing had not been completed. If <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> continues cooperating with the investigation, the state will move for dismissal of the remaining counts, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> suffers from a compulsion to gamble, and told the judge she would call two doctors to testify on <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON>'s behalf at his sentencing Last month, <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> repaid the county $ 65,334, the amount identified up to that point as having been stolen. Since then, the state's estimate of the total amount taken from elderly or mentally handicapped wards has increased from $ 114,000 to $ 200,000. <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> admitted to police that on several occasions he made checks payable to a fictitious name for repairs allegedly made to houses owned by wards. <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> told police he used money from the checks to pay gambling debts. <PERSON> Nizdil </PERSON> was fired for reasons unrelated to the thefts. County officials did not discover the missing money until January, when tenants renting a house owned by a ward complained that repairs had not been made.

<TEXT>
 Nine men have been charged with raping a woman who told authorities that her attackers urged other men gathered at an illegal cockfight to join in. The 19-year-old woman said she was abducted as she walked on a street and taken to a rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> area where as many as 20 men raped her in a parked car, according to assistant district attorney <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. Warrants charging nine local men with sexual assault were issued, said <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, chief investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Four were arrested as of Wednesday, and more arrests were expected, said <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. Charges of kidnapping could be added, he said. Authorities said many of the approximately 30 men at the illegal sporting event Saturday night knew the attack was going on but did nothing to rescue the victim, a mother of two children, even though she was crying out for help. `` Morally, it was not right for them to stand there,'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said, noting that legally the individuals could be charged with failure to render aid. `` I do n't think it was planned.

<HEAD>No Surprise: Men Prefer Short Skirts On Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While conceding that the style is inappropriate at times, men are far less willing than women to once again consign the miniskirt to fashion history, according to a poll published today. Some 36 percent of men say they prefer above-the-knee hemlines for women's skirts, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll. That compares with only a quarter of adult women who say they've worn a skirt that short in the past year In addition, 71 percent of the men surveyed say they favor skirts at or above the knee, while 46 percent of women say they prefer skirts below the knee. While men, such as <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a 25-year-old <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> engineer, said they found the short skirts `` attractive'' and `` sexy-looking,'' they also admit that longer lengths are often more practical. `` If you're in a -LRB- business -RRB- meeting and everyone's dressed conservatively, there's less distraction'' with longer skirts, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> real-estate broker and developer, likened working women in short skirts to men in shorts and beach shirts at the office. `` I do n't think it's acceptable today,'' he said. The less-than eager reaction from women to the shorter lengths introduced en masse for spring precipitated a recent return by designers to some longer lengths in their fall collections. Among different age groups, slightly more than half of women 18 to 29 years old said they'd worn miniskirts, while 27 percent of women 30 to 44 and only 8 percent of women 45 to 64 said they had. That perhaps confirms the opinion of one poll respondent, 24-year-old model <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rogersville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, who said she's noticed `` older women do n't look good in them. Only 20 percent of married women said they had worn miniskirts in the last year, compared with 56 percent of the never-been-marrieds. One unmarried woman who did not want her name used said it would be a lie to say she did not choose her clothes partly to please men. `` I do n't go out of my way if I'm going to be in a meeting all day just with women,'' she said. The poll of 1,654 adults was conducted by telephone between March 19 and 22 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percent for women and 4 percent for men. The potential error for smaller subgroups is larger.

 Two freight trains collided about two miles east of downtown, setting locomotives on fire and forcing the brief evacuation of an estimated 200 people, officials said. Crews worked through the night to right the 22 freight cars and five locomotives derailed in the Wednesday evening wreck. Two firefighters and a police officer were treated for smoke inhalation at <ORGANIZATION> Flagstaff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and released, officials said. The eastbound <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> trains collided when one failed to slow for the other at a point where parallel tracks cross, said state <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Poston </PERSON>. A fireball erupted from one of the diesel locomotive, then the fire spread to other engines, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Pasqual </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON>. `` Some of those engines were embedded into the ground, and they were strewn all over _ some right side up, some perpendicular to the track,'' said Fire Department Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellenberg </PERSON>. Some of the locomotives went down a 20-foot embankment, <PERSON> Hellenberg </PERSON> said. The evacuation of homes and businesses on the east side was called off about two hours later because shipping manifests showed there was no hazardous material near the fire. One car was loaded with explosives and another contained a flammable liquid or gas, but neither derailed, said <PERSON> Hellenberg </PERSON>. Two streets were closed, but they reopened after the fire was put out. The accident ripped out about 100 feet of railroad track, <PERSON> Hellenberg </PERSON> said.

 A drug-case witness whose house was being guarded by a police officer who was killed will receive a $ 25,000 reward in addition to $ 126,000 for his house. The city agreed to buy the home of <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON>, a Guyanese immigrant who uses only one name, after officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was slain Feb. 26 while guarding it. The officer was there because the house had been firebombed twice after <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON> complained about neighborhood drug dealers. Since <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s killing, for which four men have been arrested, the city had been using the house as a base for a narcotics task force. The city originally offered $ 140,000 for the house, which was appraised at at $ 126,000. City Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> last week forced a $ 13,500 cut in the price, arguing that if the city wanted to give <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON> a reward, it should not do so by inflating the price of the house. <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> said Wednesday he had arranged for private donors who wished to remain anonymous to give the witness a $ 25,000 reward.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> may have cooperated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British intelligence services after World War II in return for having his German army record purged of incriminating evidence, a British newspaper reported today. A panel of historians has concluded the Austrian president was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them. It also said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> concealed his wartime past and tried to make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it. The international panel of historians left open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said today it had unearthed evidence that British wartime documents and subsequent <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> papers likely to relate to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime role had been suppressed. The report, by correspondent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, said the suppression raised suspicion <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> may have collaborated with the Americans and British after the war in return for having his German army record purged. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> history professor, as saying he believes <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> passed on large amounts of information after the war to Allied intelligence agents, especially on communist partisans in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and guerrillas in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herzstein </PERSON> is due to publish a book next week that suggests <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> worked for the Americans after the war. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> quoted him as saying several records of the British element in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be missing from the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>'s report said <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> had examined hundreds of wartime files at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said that in one file on military activities in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> between May 1944 and the end of the war, when <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Dubrovnik </LOCATION>, an entire section listed in the index as `` allegations of murder of British prisoners of war'' was missing. The reporter said a government order had closed a file on the slayings to public access until the year 2021. He quoted officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> as saying they did not know when the order was issued. But he said the government decision to prevent public access was taken before 1982, when <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> ended his 10-year term as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general. Allegations about <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s alleged links to wartime atrocities surfaced in 1986 during his campaign for the Austrian presidency. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said attempts by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to seek access to specific `` closed'' files and to obtain reasons for their retention were refused.

 Two portable anti-aircraft missiles, tentatively identified as Soviet-made SAM-7s, were found aboard an Iranian gunboat recovered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last week, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. The weapons on the boat, found abandoned and drifting in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, also included three `` chaff rockets'' of unknown origin and four other unidentified rockets with fusing devices. Chaff is a material blown into the air to confuse the homing system of a radar-guided missile. Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the twin-barrelled gun mounted in the cockpit of the 30-foot boat was a Soviet-made ZSU 23mm anti-aircraft weapon. The gun apparently had been used for attacks on ships in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the Hormuz. It was rusty, but functional, and was loaded for firing when found. Authoritative references say the Soviet SAM-7, a shoulder-fired missile similar to the American-made Redeye, is known to be a part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s weapons inventory. But <PERSON> Willey </PERSON> said he did not know whether it had previously been seen in the gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also is believed to possess some U.S.-made Stinger missiles, a more advanced missile than the Redeye. It fired at least one at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter last October, but missed. Several Stingers and a spent launcher were found in a sunken Iranian speedboat recovered by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers on Jan. 3. The gunboat, an open-cockpit, twin-diesel craft, was found by the guided missile frigate <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, drifting in 10-foot seas in the Hormuz passage last Thursday. The boat's whereabouts were not disclosed. <PERSON> Willey </PERSON> would say only that it was in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> custody. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers have said they do not know why the boat apparently was abandoned by the Iranians. It appeared to have been recently vacated by its crew and was trailing a sea anchor. The fiberglass-hulled boat was the fourth Iranian small craft captured by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the past six months, but the first taken in the southern waterway where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval frigates and Revolutionary Guards concentrate their surface raids on neutral shipping. In addition to the rockets and missiles, <PERSON> Willey </PERSON> said the boat yielded one Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle and 203 rounds of ammunition, 500 rounds of ammunition for the mounted gun, and related items. The missiles apparently were contained in a sealed wooden box, six feet long, found in the bottom of the boat. Officers on the <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> did not open the box, but there was speculation at the time that it might contain Stingers or other portable rockets. The SAM-7, known as the `` Strela,'' or arrow in Russian, has an effective range of about two miles, atttacking aircraft by homing in on their engine exhaust. Although it has been replaced in the Soviet inventory by a newer portable missile, the SAM-14, the <LOCATION> Strela </LOCATION> is still being produced for Soviet forces and for export sales. It also is manufactured by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and more than 40 countries, including both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, are believed to have the weapon in their arsenals. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials gave no further information on the chaff rockets found on the Iranian boat. Such rockets are carried aboard most warships and aircraft in the gulf.

 The `` Mole Patrol'' is on a roll. For nine years, Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> worked underground, patrolling the 3 -LCB- - mile network of corridors, platforms and tunnels of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s mass-transit system His unit was justly dubbed the Mole Patrol. He now helps run the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s two battery-powered carts, which cruise silently through the concourse at the hub of the city's transportation system. The white and blue industrial carts, fitted with searchlights, rescue gear, two-way radio, roll bar and dome lights, can carry 8,400 pounds and have a top speed of about 10 mph. They cost $ 6,200 apiece. The new carts were quickly dubbed `` mole mobiles.'' After all, `` transit response vehicles'' just sounds too stuffy. Before the carts came, if <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> heard of trouble in another part of the concourse, `` it would be a footrace,'' he said. `` You'd be exhausted by the time you got there.'' `` We see a very positive response by all the store owners,'' Capt. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, commander of the transit unit, said Wednesday. `` They see this cart, they come out and want to say hello. The public stops you all the time,'' he said. `` They get a real kick out of the fact that the police are down here in strength.'' Within the next year the department hopes to add five more of the vehicles, because a cart is cheaper than paying for extra officers, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. The vehicles are parked and recharged during morning and evening rush hours, when the transit system's 350,000 daily passengers clog the passageways. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said he and another officer arrested a burglar their first night, when they received a suspicious-person report and sped off to a far-off part of the concourse, which features stores, restaurants and banks. `` Lo and behold, there's a man standing there inside a closed store,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` The only thing he said was, ` I did n't hear you coming.'''

 A former preschool worker has been ordered to wear a sign around her neck about her sex offenses after she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of sexually assaulting two girls. <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> on Wednesday gave <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bothell </LOCATION> a choice between spending 30 days in jail or wearing the sign for 60 days every time she goes out in public. Ms. <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON> chose to wear the sign. She taught at a Montessori school at the time of the assaults on two girls, aged 4 and 5. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> left it up to county prosecutors to decide the size and exact wording of the sign to be worn by the 19-year-old woman, who is five months pregnant. `` My words to her were that she must wear a sign saying: ` I've been convicted of communicating with a minor for immoral purposes,''' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> also ordered Ms. <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON> to write letters of apology to both victims, who were in court. Both prosecution and defense attorneys objected to the ruling. `` Our office has a preference for punishment that includes confinement, supervision and treatment, and we prefer those methods over the ones used by the judge in this case,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's administrative assistant. `` You get to the matter of whether the punishment is cruel and unusual,'' he said. `` I'm not a lawyer, but I do think it's unusual. Prosecutors had recommended a suspended one-year jail term for Ms. <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON>, plus payment of counseling costs for the children and a mental health evaluation for Ms. <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON> is likely to stay in her residence the entire 60-day period to avoid wearing the sign in public. Ms. <PERSON> Guptill-Gilbert </PERSON> already has moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, raising questions about how sign order will be enforced. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> has scheduled a court hearing May 4 to find out whether <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> authorities will assume responsibility for monitoring the punishment. The 60-day period for wearing the sign is n't to begin until then. `` If she feels that wearing a sign is too much of a burden for her out in the public, all she has to do is stay home, which serves the same purpose as keeping her in the jail,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today it would stop missile attacks on Iranian cities for three days beginning at midnight, then said it fired three missiles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 10 hours before the truce was to begin. In another development, an Iranian warship today attacked and set ablaze a Cypriot supertanker in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The tanker's crew of 45 was rescued by salvage tugboats after the tanker ran aground. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said two anti-aircraft missiles that may be Soviet-made SAM-7s were found aboard an Iranian gunboat the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> discovered abandoned and drifting at the southern end of the gulf. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said one of the three Iraqi long-range missiles fired at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hit <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, seat of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious hierarchy, and two hit <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, capital of the ancient Persian empire. It said the missiles were fired about 2 p.m. local time, 10 hours before the proposed cease-fire was to begin. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had no immediate reaction to the missile attacks on <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. But an Iranian Embassy official in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, was quoted as saying today that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will comply with the proposed cease-fire if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> does. `` Iranian attacks will automatically come to an end if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stops the war of the cities,'' embassy spokesman <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagri </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the missile duel during which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired 105 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, 13 into <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and 10 into <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> since Feb. 29. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it fired 45 missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, a city of 5 million people, and dozens into the northern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> and other cities in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an unidentified government spokesman as saying the cease-fire was `` a gesture of courtesy'' to Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, who was scheduled to begin a 48-hour visit to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> was on an official visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Feb. 29, and one of the first <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> crashed near a downtown hotel where members of the Turkish delegation were staying. None of the Turkish officials was hurt. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, an Iranian warship attacked the 232,164-ton Haven tanker near the Strait of Hormuz at the southern end of the gulf sand set its load of Saudi crude oil on fire, gulf-based shipping executives said. The ship drifted for more than three hours after the dawn attack and eventually ran aground off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The crew was rescued by salvage tugboats. At least eight tugs fought the fire on the grounded tanker for three hours before the blaze was controlled, the executives said.

 A Stradivarius violin fetched a world record auction price for a musical instrument of $ 889,240 at a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s sale today, the auctioneers said The violin, made in 1709 by Italian craftsman <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Stradivari </PERSON>, is named after the master English violinist <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Composer <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> composed `` The Lark Ascending'' for Hall, which she first performed in 1920. An unidentified private South American buyer beat out two other dealers bidding by telephone in a tense, two-minute auction. `` It was quite drawn out and tense and there was a round of applause at the end,'' said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> McHattie </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> had been expected to sell for around $ 846,000, and bidding started at $ 376,000, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. The previous highest auction price for a Stradivarius was $ 728,000 for The Colossus, dated 1716, which was sold at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last April The Guinness Book of Records says the highest known price for a Stradivarius was $ 1.2 million. But that was in a private sale of Stradivarius' Alard violin by <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and Sons to a Singaporean on an unknown date. About 700 of 1,116 violins by Stradivarius have survived. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, considered one of the finest violinists of her era, died at age 72 in 1956. She acquired the violin in 1905 and it was passed on to her daughter when she died. When it was last auctioned by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s in November 1968, the violin sold for a then world record price of $ 52,600. The violin was included in a day-long sale of violins, violas and other stringed instruments.

 <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was in the White House and Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> was one year away from making his last stand when <PERSON> Orpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> was born Aug. 13, 1875. Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON>, believed by the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> to be the world's oldest person, died Wednesday at age 112. She had pneumonia recently, but an official cause of death was not released, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON>, director of nursing at <LOCATION> Fountainview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> lived. `` Her condition worsened during the weekend,'' Miss <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> said. `` She could n't do anything for herself anymore,'' said a stepdaughter-in-law, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON>. `` You ca n't do anything for a person who does n't want to live anymore.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> said she was saddened by the death, but said Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> had lived a good life. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> officials said they believed she was the oldest person alive. Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> was honored at a special ceremony in January when officials put the <LOCATION> Goshen </LOCATION> city seal on census documents indicating she was born in 1875 on the family farm near <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> about 10 miles away. She spent most of her life in <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> until moving to the nursing home in 1982. <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, who lived in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb, had been recognized as the world's oldest person until her death Jan. 11. She was 114 years and 94 days old. Guinness restricts recognition to those who can provide birth records and other documentation. There had been some confusion whether Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> would be 112 or 113 last Aug. 13. For years she had maintained she was a year older than she actually was. But a document found in the public library in this northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> city last September showed that the former <PERSON> Orpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulery </PERSON> was 4 years old when she was counted in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Census of 1880, making her 112. Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> attributed her longevity to her strict obedience to a biblical command, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> said. `` She honored her father and mother. That's it,'' she said. For many years Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> taught Sunday school in the <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Goshen </LOCATION> areas. When she was 93, she resumed writing poetry, a hobby she had stopped in the 1920s. Mrs. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> married <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mischler </PERSON>, a minister, in 1897.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Early Indicator Of Some AIDS Cases, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cardiologists should be aware that heart disease can be an early indicator of AIDS, and some patients can live longer with proper cardiac care, according to research presented at the American College of Cardiology convention. In a 1983-86 study of 86 AIDS patients in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 18 had heart disease and seven of those had heart disease before other AIDS-related ailments, Dr. <PERSON> Evlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday at the ACC meeting. `` Heart disease was present in 5 percent of all AIDS patients _ that's our estimate based on the patients we have seen,'' she said. `` Cardiologists need to be aware of AIDS heart disease.'' While little could be done for AIDS patients suffering from tumor-based heart disease, she said, cardiac disease stemming from opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis _ rather than from tumors _ can be treated, prolonging the lives of terminally ill patients. `` There were patients who, with treatment, survived as long as -LRB- AIDS -RRB- patients without heart disease,'' <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said. `` Some of these patients, we did manage to prolong their lives for many months.'' AIDS cripples the body's ability to fight off disease, allowing a variety of ailments _ including heart disease _ to cause death. Fourteen of the 18 AIDS heart patients were dead within four months of diagnosis, but the other four _ all with infection-related heart disease _ lived for about two years, she said. Another participant in the study, Dr. <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsuez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hopital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said early, specific diagnosis of the ailments plaguing AIDS patients can help physicians prolong life. Tuberculosis, for instance, is a frequent ailment in AIDS patients, and it can be treated. `` If we can treat each organ involved, it's a very important thing,'' <PERSON> Monsuez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> noted that there were only eight women among the 86 AIDS patients studied, but half of them were suffering from AIDS-related heart disease. While noting that the number of female patients was small, she said, `` Females seem to be more susceptible to AIDS heart disease ... the women were represented disproportionately.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet fighter plunged into the center of this small town today, killing the pilot and at least one resident, setting homes on fire and forcing the evacuation of about 60 people. The plane was carrying a canister of hydrazine, which forms toxic gas when mixed with water, but local officials said there was no evidence of a gas leak. Witnesses said the F-16 smashed into the roof of one home, tore of the porch off another and started a ball of fire that sent residents fleeing. `` There was a crash and then a loud explosion and buildings caught fire,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loef </PERSON>, a baker who lives three houses away from the street from the crash site. The plane was demolished. Regional governor <PERSON> Berhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditteney </PERSON> said the body of a 60-year-old man was pulled from the rubble and rescue workers were looking for other victims. At least one resident was injured. It was the second crash of a military aircraft in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in as many days. On Wednesday, a French Mirage jet fighter narrowly missed a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, about 185 miles east of today's crash site, before crashing and burning. The pilot was killed. Today's crash occurred at 10 a.m. -LRB- 3 a.m. EST -RRB- in the middle of <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, a town of 6,000 residents 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, police said. The pilot, whose identity was not immediately released, was the only person aboard, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Wreckage was scattered over a wide area and thick black smoke billowed from the crash site, witnesses said. Three homes were destroyed and two were extensively damaged, including that of an 80-year-old woman who managed to escape unharmed when the plane hit her house, officials said. Emergency crews evacuated more than 60 people from about 40 houses in the area, according to local police. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, said the jet had been declared missing after taking off from <ORGANIZATION> Hahn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Eifel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Neunherz </PERSON>, another base spokesman, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that the F-16 was on a training mission, but he had no further details. He confirmed the plane was carrying hydrazine, which is used to refire jet engines in case of engine failure. But <PERSON> Neunherz </PERSON> added, `` That gas disperses easily in the event of an accident.'' <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharer </PERSON>, spokesman for police in nearby <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no evidence to indicate any toxic gas was released. <PERSON> Scharer </PERSON> said he was told by American authorities that the plane was carrying 500 rounds of practice ammunition but no live ammunition. The F-16 was part of the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing, <PERSON> Neunherz </PERSON> said. Wednesday's crash in the Bavarian village of <LOCATION> Ohu </LOCATION> unleashed a wave of concern about military jets flying near nuclear power plants. Environmentalists maintain the country had escaped disaster by a `` split second'' when the jet crashed about one mile from the <LOCATION> Isar </LOCATION> nuclear plant. But officials said there was no danger of an atomic accident because of a concrete dome over the plant, which they said was designed to withstand the force of a jet crash.

 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> today said he resigned as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador so he could speak out against Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meeting with two Arab-Americans linked to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The meeting raises a larger question of the value of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> commitments to us when we have made huge concessions to obtain these guarantees,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, referring to a 1975 American pledge not to meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members. `` As long as I was wearing an ambassador's suit, I could n't speak out openly,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> He said the meeting could `` jeopardize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s very existence.'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said he had been planning to resign in a few weeks, but decided to speed it up after the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> meeting. His resignation was to take effect immediately. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has suggested <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Natan </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as a possible replacement. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>'s resignation was the strongest message yet from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> regarding its displeasure over <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meeting five days ago with two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s self-declared legislative body Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, sharpened his opposition to the session with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON>, both American citizens. He told members of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc the meeting was `` a slap in the face'' and said: `` The two men were representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It was possible to see on television how much they hate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, 39, who gained prominence as an articulate defender of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policies during his four years as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, made a surprise announcement of his resignation on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night. He said he was planning to resign `` in a matter of weeks'' anyway to allow him to begin campaigning for a seat as a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator in November's elections. While stressing that he still had `` warm personal regard'' for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said the secretary's meeting with <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, had created `` a deep rift'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Even friends can sometimes take steps which are unacceptable or dangerous,'' he said. Because of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meeting, <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said, `` It appears the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will be introduced into the proposed international conference through the back door.'' `` The very clear possibility exists now that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will sit across the table from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in this conference and will be the party we will be demanded to give land to,'' he said. `` Then the conference could result in a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> state right in the heart of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, threatening our very security, our very future.'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said he would publicly oppose the American peace initiative, particularily the portion which calls for an international conference including the parties to the conflict and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I will pound the pavement from city to city in order to explain to the public the dangers of an international conference,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> says Baby M will be better equipped to deal with her future if she continues to grow up knowing her natural mother. `` The best interest of this child is plainly to continue the present relationship. It's a good relationship. Let's make it better. Let's go to work,'' attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> said Wednesday in closing arguments in the Baby M visitation hearing. But an attorney for the child's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, and his wife <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, said the 2-year-old girl has an excellent relationship with the Tenafly couple that should not be disrupted by visitation for at least five years. `` She does n't need two mothers when a functional mother and father are everything this child needs,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said in his summation. The 1 -LCB- hours of closing arguments brought to an end a long and bitter courtroom fight for the child, now legally known as <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. The decision on visitation now rests with <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>, whose ruling is not expected before next week. The dispute began after the child was born on March 27, 1986, and Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> reneged on a surrogacy contract with the Sterns. It climaxed with an unprecedented Feb. 3 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that outlawed surrogacy for pay. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, 30, who currently sees her daughter during two-hour, supervised visits once a week, said she wants `` meaningful'' and gradually expanded visitation. The Sterns have custody and want to delay Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s visitation rights <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> warned the judge Wednesday that to reject immediate visitation would go against the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling and `` by indirection we are enforcing the surrogacy contract.'' <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> said Wednesday that gradually expanded visitation by Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> is in <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s best interest. `` She will be better equipped to go forward and deal with life,'' he said. <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> said both sides should undergo counseling to heal wounds and ensure a smooth visitation schedule. But <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> rejected counseling. `` It's pie in the sky,'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. `` It just does n't happen in our experience.'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> also said that Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> may try to exploit the child. He cited Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s decision to sell pictures of her wedding with Wall Street accountant <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> for $ 20,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, a supermarket tabloid. `` One wonders what price a picture of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> would bring,'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said.

 You can carry your skis on the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, but you better not try to use them to ski down the famous _ and treacherous _ <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravine </PERSON>. `` We do n't plan to let the people who ride the train ski down <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravine </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Therrien </PERSON>. `` We will take some action to prevent people from trespassing under federal regulations.''

The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it feared letting skiers ride the train up the mountain would increase the number of inexperienced skiers trying to make the dangerous run down the ravine and its famed headwall.

 Lebanese soldiers killed two Syrian soldiers in a battle in a Christian enclave early today, the first clash between the forces in more than two years, military sources said. The Lebanese opened fire on a Syrian patrol that entered the eastern edge of the Christians' 300-square-mile enclave in northeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before dawn, one source said. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two sides clashed for about 30 minutes with automatic weapons and grenades near the village of <LOCATION> Zighrine </LOCATION>. No Lebanese casualties were reported. <PERSON> Zighrine </PERSON>, a Christian village, lies 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The source said the Syrian patrol `` withdrew from the <LOCATION> Zighrine </LOCATION> area after the clash.'' He did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 25,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also has 7,500 troops in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> seeking to restore law and order after years of militia anarchy.

 City officials rearranged two crosses made from lillies at Easter flower shows after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> objected that the displays promoted religion on public property.

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported that a brother and sister were sentenced to eight-year prison terms in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after admitting that they spied for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The Prensa Latina dispatch from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, received here late Wednesday, identified the two as <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Juana </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and said they had `` proven ties'' to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said the two `` admitted during the trial their activity in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> center of espionage.'' It said the maximum sentence for the charges was 10 years imprisonment, and the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> judge trying the case reduced it to eight because the two confessed. Cuban television had reported in May 1987 that Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, said to be a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> resident of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, recruited and trained her brother to work as a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said today it is ready to sign a settlement to end the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> conflict and expects progress soon on deciding when outside military aid to the Soviet-backed government and guerrillas will end. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in an interview released today it was possible the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks would fail, but he said that would not necessarily stop the Soviets from withdrawing their troops. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials received indications the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will consider allowing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to the rebels to continue after the 115,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops begin leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> officials have said the issue of continued aid to the Afghan government and the rebels fighting it is the last obstacle in the way of an accord to end the war. <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting Foreign Minister, said his country will sign `` any time during the day or after the Easter break, when the other three parties are ready to sign.'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> spoke after his side and an Afghan government delegation resumed the U.N.-mediated talks. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> represents the rebels, and the other parties are the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` From our point of view, all the ... instruments -LRB- of the peace package -RRB- are complete,'' he said. `` We are hopeful that in the next few days there ought to be some kind of progress'' on the aid issue, he added. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said it will not guarantee a settlement unless the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agrees to stop funding the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government at the same time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stops aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s interview with the Bulgarian newspaper <PERSON> Rabotnichesko </PERSON> <PERSON> Delo </PERSON> was carried by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> earlier this week for a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact meeting. `` Not everything depends solely on us and the Afghan government,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, referring to the outcome of the talks. `` This is why one can not but take into account the possibility that the talks may not lead to the accords expected of them.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said that if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks fail, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will withdraw its soldiers `` in a way convenient for the government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and ourselves.'' He gave no indication whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would stick to the nine-month timetable for withdrawal already agreed to in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He said an agreement could be implemented without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was willing to sign a document spelling out the details of the Soviet withdrawal. `` It would certainly be better if it -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- becomes a guarantor. But it is quite possible, in our opinion, to conclude the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> process without the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees,'' he said. <PERSON> Zoorani </PERSON> rejected this, saying everything would have to be renegotiated if one of the superpowers refuses its guarantor role. The Times, citing unidentified senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering an arrangement under which <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would sign the accord, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would have a separate understanding on aid to the insurgents. The new position was discussed by telephone Wednesday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 Communist Party officials of a southern city paralyzed by a strike again appealed to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leaders to resolve a dispute between two Soviet ethnic groups but condemned the tactics of protesters, a newspaper reported today. The appeal, adopted at a meeting Wednesday, did not persuade people to return to work, according to one resident who said the strike continued today in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of the disputed region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The majority of people living in the region are Armenian, but it is part of the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians are demanding that it be made part of neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` People are n't even thinking of going to work,'' said the resident, a man answering the telephone at the <LOCATION> Sovietsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> newspaper. He refused to give his name or position. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Stepanakert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was stormy and that one speaker, an engineer, cried. `` The majority of the Communists decisively condemned the tactic of ` forced pressure' on the country's leadership, and along with that every speaker underlined that the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> problem has not been removed, that it still needs a settlement,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said in a report from <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution containing the appeal to national leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. It provided no other details. Wednesday's Soviet press reports said workers vowed to continue the walkout until the government and party reversed their decisions to leave <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> under the control of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The city committee had asked national leaders to reconsider the annexation demand in February after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> belongs to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, approved a package of cultural and economic improvements for the region on March 23 but did not address the territorial issue. Street demonstrations and strikes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, have tested Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness. At least 32 people were killed in ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> last month. All but essential services such as bread and milk factories and some public transportation and medical clinics have been closed in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> since the strike began March 24. The man at the <LOCATION> Sovietsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> newspaper said there were no demonstrations in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and that police were keeping a low profile. <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> police last week arrested several Armenian nationalists who had been advocating the annexation. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> provided the first official confirmation that <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, was among those arrested. The spokesman, at a regular news briefing, said he did not know under which criminal statute Ayrikyan was being held. Dissidents have said authorities charged <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> with violating a law against defamation of the Soviet state. The Soviet government has forbidden foreign journalists from traveling to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has vacated the sentence of a convicted arms broker because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government withheld information about its arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> when the man was sentenced. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said Wednesday he would have imposed a different sentence on <PERSON> Lemuel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had he known about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's arms sales. `` The judge should have all the information he can before he sentences somebody, and in this case, he did n't,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> `` He did n't have super-duper important stuff.'' <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> ruled that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s knowledge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should have been communicated to the assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who prosecuted <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. He said the government had a duty to disclose information about the scheme to the defense and the court before sentencing. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said the government's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` in no way affect the guilt of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>,'' who pleaded guilty to conspiring to ship military equipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in 1984, when he was the president of Marietta-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION>. But the judge wrote, `` This court continues to believe that the government's conduct in selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while prosecuting an individual for substantially similar conduct -LRB- even though such conduct occurred at an earlier time -RRB- is relevant to the sentence to be imposed ... and should have been disclosed.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said the government disagreed with the ruling, but no decision has been made on an appeal. `` It may make sense for policy and practical reasons to essentially let the matter lie where it is, but we have not reached that decision yet,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. `` I'm just grateful for his decision,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, now a salesman of recreational vehicles. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> released him on his own recognizance in June 1987 pending a final order. <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> said he hoped <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> will re-sentence <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to the 17 months he already has served, four months short of the scheduled release date under federal parole guidelines for his original three-year sentence.

In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops sealed off the city hall after reports of a bomb threat, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> defended his recent meeting with Arab-Americans who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said he was resigning immediately, a few weeks earlier than he originally planned, to speak out against the meeting On Wednesday, when Palestinians observed Land Day, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> clamped down on Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with its toughest restrictions in 20 years of occupation. Land Day commemorates a confrontation on March 30, 1976, when Israeli Arabs protested the forced sale of 1,600 acres of their land for Jewish settlement. Six Arabs were killed. The army barred reporters from entering the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> except in news pools with an army escort, and restricted the movement of Palestinians. The measures, however, failed to prevent violence. Officials said four Arabs were shot and killed and 39 were wounded by gunfire Wednesday, and two were injured in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said today the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> placed new travel restrictions on Palestinians from east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where 130,000 Arabs live. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed the predominantly Arab sector of the city in 1967. It said Palestinians aged 16 to 35 now need special permits to travel to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and these will be issued only if the request is for a stay of at least nine months. The object is to stop the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from sending couriers into the occupied territories. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Hadar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasis </PERSON> told a reporter the military authorities informed him Palestinians could withdraw only $ 1,000 a month from bank accounts. Earlier restrictions bar Arabs from bringing more than $ 1,200 at a time across the bridges from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The moves are designed to keep the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from compensating merchants and workers for loss of income during anti-Israeli strikes and protests. `` We are prepared for anything. ... We can exist just on bread and zatar -LRB- a peppery spice -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Kasis </PERSON>, a gift-store owner. The Israeli army said it received reports of an explosion in the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> city hall area about midday today, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said soldiers briefly sealed off the area. The witnesses said Israeli or municipal officials apparently had received a bomb threat, but the details were sketchy. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sealed off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to media Monday night and the movements of journalists were severely limited. The Israeli-appointed acting mayor, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Assayad </PERSON>, said there was an unsuccessful attempt late Wednesday to break into the building. He said he left City Hall about 11 a.m. -LRB- 4 a.m. EST -RRB- and knew of no attack. Underground leaflets signed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have ordered all Arab municipal councils to resign, accusing them of collaborating with Israeli authorities. In remarks broadcast today by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reacted to Israeli protests over his meeting last Saturday with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughud </PERSON>. He said it was `` beyond the pale'' to suggest he could not meet American citizens. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also stressed the importance of finding <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators: `` Palestinians are part of the peace issue. We have got to find a way to be in contact with them.'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> resigned Wednesday because he contended the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was violating a commitment not to talk directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I could not speak freely -LRB- about this -RRB- as long as I was ambassador,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would press ahead with his peace initiative _ essentially an exchange of land for peace with the Arabs _ but would wait until <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and Israelis are ready to talk peace before asking <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to send out invitiations to an international conference. Violent protests by Palestinians against Israeli rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began Dec. 8. Wednesday's fatalities brought to at least 123 the number of Arabs killed by Israelis in the unrest, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed.

 A Nigerian cargo plane loaded with cows, a limousine and tons of other goods crashed on takeoff from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> today, killing all four crewmen, including an American, officials said. The DC-8 was chartered by the Egyptian air transport company ZAS and was bound for <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION>, one of the seven emirates of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, operations chief of ZAS, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the plane crashed on desert terrain just beyond the runway at 4:10 a.m. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said the American pilot and three Nigerian crew members were killed. A spokesman for ARAX, the Nigerian firm that owned the plane, identified the pilot as <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapaga </PERSON> but did n't know his age, hometown, or how long he had been with the company. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> identified the American only as <PERSON> Trapanga </PERSON> and said he did n't know his first name. It was n't known which spelling of the name was correct. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said he was an American of Spanish origin. The <ORGANIZATION> ARAX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, at the company's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office, identified two of the Nigerians as <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Adjaye </PERSON>. The third was identified only by his last name, <PERSON> Oladunni </PERSON>. Neither the spokesman nor <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> had <PERSON> Oladunni </PERSON>'s first name. The news agency quoted control tower officials as saying the plane caught fire in the air. The agency said the pilot needed two tries to get the plane into the air. The first time, he sped down the runway but failed to become airborne. The second time, `` the plane caught fire as it was about 50 yards above the ground and crashed in the desert area around the airport,'' the agency said. Airport officials said the aircraft's 28 tons of cargo included 50 cows and a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> limousine. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said the plane was a replacement for a DC-8 that slid off a runway Wednesday in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> while en route to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to pick up the cargo. That plane was seriously damaged, and <ORGANIZATION> ARAX </ORGANIZATION> dispatched another plane, with a different crew, to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said. The plane involved in today's crash was destroyed, and officials said the cows were killed.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign is planning an intense effort to woo Democratic `` super delegates'' as the likelihood increases that they will determine the party's nominee. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides say the campaign also is planning to seek new money and hire an advance team, a staple of the other candidates' campaigns And they said that as scrutiny of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> increases, the press and public can expect to see him offering more details and specifics of his various domestic and foreign policy ideas. In two days of meetings here this week, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with his top financial organizers and with prominent Democratic leaders whom he hoped to pull into his camp, or at least milk for advice. His campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, said there will be a concerted plan to court super delegates, the 645 people who are automatically Democratic convention delegates by virtue of their status as party or elected officials. They are viewed as critical in this year's campaign, since it appears no candidate by the end of the primary season will have the 2,082 delegates needed to lock up the nomination. The decision could rest with the super delegates at the summer nominating convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. So far, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has gained the most support from established paty leaders. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has a slight lead in the popular vote cast so far, has said the super delegates should `` respect the super voters'' and back whoever has the most votes after the last primaries on June 7. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the campaign will be phoning the super delegates and mailing them information on what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has accomplished and soliciting their support. In addition, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, particularly members of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, will contact super delegates, said Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` The front line is the congressional Black Caucus ... to talk to our colleagues in our states, to lobby people who are super delegates,'' he said. In fund-raising, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s fortunes have grown steadily from a shoestring budget to a $ 1-million month in March, the biggest single fund-raising month of the campaign. Campaign aides said that since the March 8 Super Tuesday series of primaries in 20 states, unsolicited donations have increased dramatically, augmented by an active direct-mail program. `` The phones are ringing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'' at campaign headquarters, said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` People want to get involved _ to do fund raisers in states we've already contested.'' Campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the campaign has raised $ 1 million in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> alone. He said plans are to continue to increase the pace through a series of fund-raising techniques and events. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, spends the money as fast as it comes in and still lags far behind the big warchest of Democratic money leader <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who generally has cash on hand of $ 3 or $ 4 million, according to financial reports. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said the campaign hopes to raise at least $ 3 million for television alone between now and the end of the primary season. `` We're going to scorch the earth,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will air TV ads in every upcoming state, but will not conduct the kind of saturation media effort that other candidates have used, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. `` We're showing you can win elections without spending the kind of money these guys spend,'' he said. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said he is interviewing potential candidates to come on board for advance work, in anticipation of more organization in upcoming state primaries and caucuses. But he said that overall he does not anticipate expanding the campaign staff of some 90 people, at least for now. `` We're just winning. We're going to continue to do what we've done so far,'' he said Campaign aides said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has no plan to change his basic message or his `` economic justice'' theme. But political director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said there may be a few new issues coming out. `` We've got a few in the hopper,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is ready to offer more details and specifics of the various programs and ideas he proposes, aides said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the overall campaign operation has been working well state-to-state, with the campaign tapping into existing constituent organizations to serve as the underpinning for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> operation. `` We know who to look for when we go in there _ Hispanic groups, women's groups, blacks, workers, farmers, environmentalists, students,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. Part of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> strategy, he acknowledged, is to refrain from public predictions on how <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will run in a given contest. `` We were convinced we could win it from the beginning but were n't anxious to wake anybody up,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> leads in the popular vote total of states that have voted so far, and is running a close second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the delegate count.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today began closing its offices for the Easter weekend with most of its employees unpaid and hopes fading for a mediated settlement to the crisis over strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. As the government closed down until Monday, a few more shops and stores reopened their doors in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, widening the cracks in an 11-day-old general strike aimed at forcing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. The closure of government offices left thousands of public employees unpaid for the second time this month, despite a new infusion of an estimated $ 19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $ 5.5 million of that money reportedly came from taxes and fees paid by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, despite a number of official economic sanctions applied against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave the country. As head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, he is the power behind the civilian government. The government, its opposition and the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader all expressed doubt at prospects for negotiating an end to the crisis. The reservations were voiced Wednesday just hours after the mediation initiative involving Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> was disclosed. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> announced through a spokesman on Tuesday that he was willing to try to negotiate an end to 10 months of political turmoil that have in the past month deepened into acute crisis. On Wednesday, he told journalists he remained willing to proceed, but added: `` It is evident that for the government and for the military, this process could be somewhat difficult, because as far as they are concerned, the church is partial.'' He said that `` the church has had the moral duty to criticize those who have used force excessively'' as the government has harshly suppressed anti-Noriega street protests. <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Renan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzpurua </PERSON>, columnist for the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION>, which is run by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, expressed even greater doubts about the archbishop's suitability as a mediator. <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month on federal charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine, charges he denies. `` <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> is from head to toe just another ugly American and he can not be the mediator,'' <PERSON> Renan </PERSON> wrote in Wednesday's paper. `` That would be like inviting a thief to eat at your table.'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>'s parents were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nationals and the churchman still speaks Spanish with an American accent. `` I have not asked to be mediator, and if the mediation can be carried out by someone else or in another form, so be it,'' he said. The archbishop's intervention was proposed Sunday by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cost </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> prime minister, who was visiting <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> at the time. <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinard </PERSON>, a top leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, gave <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> this assessment of the prospective mediation: `` We do n't have much hope of a positive result. We can not trust the military.'' She said the regime's crackdown Monday, when an anti-government march was smashed by riot troops and more than 20 crusade members arrested, `` demonstrates that the government has no inclination to dialogue ... How can you negotiate with someone who's pointing a pistol at your head?'' Ms. <PERSON> Guinard </PERSON> said the crusade, an alliance of 200 business, labor and civic groups spearheading the drive to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, is considering calling off the general strike that has since March 21 shut down most of the country's economic activity. She said it may have outlived its usefulness. Industry, construction and most commerce remained virtually paralyzed Wednesday, but the city's three major supermarket chains reopened. Visits to several of the stores found them doing brisk but orderly business. Clients were buying only essentials, especially staples including rice, oil, beans and milk. Most shoppers also were stocking up on toilet paper. Banks have been closed for four weeks. Cash is extremely scarce, almost everyone is doing without some things and many people are nearly desperate. The banks closed after a run on deposits precipitated by the political crisis. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had orchestrated the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, hours after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, continuing to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, on March 3 froze Panamanian government funds in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is in hiding.

<HEAD>Men Tested Without Permission For AIDS, Suing Doctors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three men are suing doctors for allegedly testing them for AIDS without their permission, complaining their privacy was violated and that the test results caused them mental anguish. The lawsuits say one of the three considered suicide and another was forced to leave his home town because of societal pressure after they were told they tested positive for the AIDS virus. Lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, who filed all three suits, said such testing occurs more often than patients realize. `` I believe that such testing is going on all over,'' <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said. `` In most cases, people are tested without their knowledge and simply never know.'' <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Action AIDS, a nonprofit organization that assists people with AIDS in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, said AIDS testing without permission is `` happening far too frequently.'' `` Often this testing is being done without consideration of the impact it has on people and their families,'' she said. `` Telling people that they are infected with the virus is a psychological bombshell because you are dealing with an incurable disease.'' A study published last week in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said 34 percent of 189 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals surveyed rarely asked patients' permission before testing for the AIDS virus. The three men, who were not identified at their request, are suing the doctors for more than $ 200,000 in damages. The doctors and their representatives refused comment to comment on the suits. In one lawsuit, filed Wednesday in federal court in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, a 40-year-old man contends he was forced to leave his home after he tested positive for exposure to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He said his physician never asked his permission. The man said although he is infected with the virus, he does not have AIDS or AIDS-related diseases. The plaintiff in another suit, filed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Common Pleas Court, said he went to a hospital for treatment of a minor eye infection and gave permission for a blood test but not for an AIDS test. He contemplated suicide after he was told he tested positive for AIDS, according to the suit. In the third suit, also filed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> court, the plaintiff alleges that he was tested for the AIDS virus without permission after he went to her for a premarital blood test. A second test showed he was not infected.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> agreed during telephone talks to continue aiding Afghan resistance forces after Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if the Soviets continue backing the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said today. The officials also confirmed reports that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is actively involved in a new effort to settle the aid issue with the Soviets. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not and will not stop assisting the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance unless the Soviets stop aiding the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> `` reaffirmed'' this view during a telephone conversation on Wednesday. There has been concern within the administration that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ through which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the guerrillas is funnelled _ would halt the flow of aid once an agreement is signed. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is eager for a settlement and a Soviet troop withdrawal because a pact would presumably permit millions of Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to return to their homeland. The presidents' conversation and a flurry of diplomatic activity with the Soviets are part of an effort to finish a U.N.-sponsored accord that would permit the orderly withdrawal of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and require a cessation of outside aid to the guerrillas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to be a `` guarantor'' of the agreement, but has insisted it will stop aiding the Afghan rebels after Soviet withdrawal only if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stops sending supplies and financial support to the Afghan government. The Soviets have said they have a right to continue such aid under treaties with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official today confirmed reports in The Washington Post and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ask the Soviets to agree to a continuation of the two superpowers' aid to their clients in the Afghan struggle Instead of agreeing to a parallel cessation of aid, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would agree to a parallel continuation of assistance, according to the proposal. During talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> reportedly did not specifically reject the idea, but a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` it would go too far to say he agreed to consider it. `` There is some disagreement'' even within the administration on how to interpret <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s comments, the official added. Publicly, at a news conference March 23, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> rejected calls for a cessation of Soviet aid. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said some administration figures were concerned about the legality of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signing an Afghan peace accord that required a cutoff of aid to the resistance forces while agreeing separately with the Soviets to continue such assistance.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has offered to hold separate talks on conventional forces and battlefield nuclear arms and urged the superpowers to sign by July 1 a pact to halve their long-range nuclear arsenals. The Soviet-led alliance's seven foreign ministers also said Wednesday after a two-day meeting in the Bulgarian capital of <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> that the superpowers should agree to abide by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says the treaty bars development of a space-based missile defense system. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers urged <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to begin talks this year on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and backed down from a longstanding position by offering separate negotiations on battlefield nuclear weapons. The offer appeared aimed at overcoming a more than year-old absence of movement toward new talks on reducing conventional forces across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We welcome the statements of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact foreign ministers ... to the extent that they seem to reflect some of the concerns of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statement released today in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The statement added that it was important that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's words be translated into concrete proposals at the negotiating table The appeals, published by the Bulgarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, indicated Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is eager to seal a pact on intercontinental nuclear missiles but not insisting it be ready to sign when he meets President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29 to June 2. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON> told journalists in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> still hopes the agreement can be signed during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. But the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> statement indicated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> links a pact on strategic arms to adherence to the 1972 ABM treaty, which sets limits on superpower missile defenses. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has argued that the ABM accord permits research and testing of the its space-based missile defense project, popularly called `` Star Wars.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> insists the ABM accord rules out any such system. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> statement said talks on what the 16-nations <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> calls conventional stability should begin this year, but set no time for the separate negotations on tactical nuclear and dual capability weapons. East-West disagreement over how to count <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troop levels has stalled <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on reducing conventional forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since they opened in 1973. Those negotations are likely to be wound down if new talks on conventional stability are started. Agreement on new talks on conventional forces may pave the way for settlement of other disputes, including human rights issues.

<TEXT>
 Paramilitary troops killed nine people and injured 36 when they fired on a group of people who threw stones at the soldiers' camp, news reports said today. Indian newspapers said the firing Tuesday night and Wednesday by a unit of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Assam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifles </ORGANIZATION> occurred in <LOCATION> Aizawl </LOCATION>, the capital of the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>. A nighttime curfew was clamped on the town about 990 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> was the scene of a 20-year guerrilla war for independence until 1986, when a peace accord was signed with the Indian government. It was unclear what set off the incident, but the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said the civilians were angered over an alleged assault on a local policeman Tuesday by members of the paramilitary unit. State Chief Minister <PERSON> Laldenga </PERSON> has asked Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to remove <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rifles </LOCATION> personnel from <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> for mutiny and rebellion against the government, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Laldenga </PERSON> was the leader of the independence movement. The movement was fueled by what local residents, mainly members of the <LOCATION> Mizo </LOCATION> tribe, perceived as a cultural threat from settlements by Assamese and other ethnic groups from the west. The <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> Rifles were deployed in <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION> during the guerrilla war and remained after the peace pact as a reserve police force. UNI did not give details of the assault on the local policeman, but many former guerrillas have been inducted into the state police force since the accord was signed.

<HEAD>Trial of Man Accused of Soliciting Contract Killings to Start
Monday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man who has already been convicted in one killing will go on trial here Monday on charges of soliciting contract killings through Soldier of Fortune magazine, officials said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 39, had been scheduled for trial earlier this month in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAnda </PERSON> granted a change of venue after ruling <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> could not get a fair trial there because of publicity in an unrelated civil case involving Soldier of Fortune. On March 3, a federal civil jury in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> awarded a $ 9.4 million judgment against Soldier of Fortune when it found the magazine was negligent by publishing a classified advertisement that led to a woman's slaying. Savage was not involved in that killing. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobe </PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> who will prosecute <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, declined comment on the case Wednesday, but confirmed the trial will begin Monday. Savage is already serving a 40-year prison term in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for arranging the 1985 beating death of former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Assistant City Manager <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> through an advertisement in Soldier of Fortune. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brado </PERSON> allegedly hired <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> through a Soldier of Fortune advertisement to kill <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Free </PERSON>. Savage was indicted in October 1986 along with Ms. <PERSON> Brado </PERSON> and others in the murder-for-hire scheme. Among the charges against him are four counts of use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder for hire, aiding and abetting, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district clerk's office in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Brado </PERSON> allegedly hired <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> through an ad in the magazine to arrange the death of Free, whom she said absconded with her $ 300,000 life savings. She pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the scheme and died of emphysema in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> prison while serving a five-year term. The indictment stated <PERSON> Brado </PERSON> paid Savage $ 20,000 to arrange Free's murder, to have been carried out by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, 22, both of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The pair allegedly tried to bomb Free's car in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during June 1985, but Free escaped. On Oct. 12, 1985, two grenades were thrown through his living room window, but no one was injured. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambeth </PERSON>, a 61-year-old co-defendant, also have pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the grenade attack.

 A man has been arrested on charges linked to a drug ring that was allegedly involved with Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, authorities said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON>, 37, was captured Wednesday in the southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> town of Avalon on a fugitive warrant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> was arrested after a routine license check by Avalon police on an out-of-state license plate, he said. <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> was named in a two-count indictment last January charging him with conspiring to import and attempting to import 165,000 pounds of marijuana seized by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seized in October 1985.

<TEXT>
 A bookkeeper who admitted she shot her boss to death has been acquitted of second-degree murder after testifying that she was a victim of sexual harassment. <PERSON> Roxanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullery </PERSON>, 23, told a circuit court jury she killed <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> at his Winter Park home Feb. 16, 1987, because he moved threateningly toward her and a friend and she feared he was about to rape and kill them. Ms. <PERSON> Ullery </PERSON> was convicted Wednesday of carrying a concealed weapon and shooting a firearm, and prosecutors said she would likely get a year of probation. The defendant said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 30, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Cinco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, continually made lewd comments during her six months on the job and would lift up her dress, fondle her breasts and call her into his office where he would be masturbating. However, prosecutors claimed Ms. <PERSON> Ullery </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> because he found out earlier in the day that she was embezzling money by writing paychecks to people who did not work at the company. He called her to his home to discuss the embezzlement, prosecutors said. Jurors looked at checks totaling $ 9,000 that prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Ullery </PERSON> signed and cashed. She said she did that at his direction and that he had withheld more than $ 160,000 in Social Security taxes from the government. The defense said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> threatened her with jail if she did n't do what he wanted. `` He threatened to turn her in and kill her and her son,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Willits </PERSON>. `` What it amounted to was psychological warfare.''

 Every time <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> goes to work, he plunges 230 feet into a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sinkhole and 12,000 years into the past. <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> is an underwater archaeologist who is harvesting relics from the Pleistocene Epoch, some of them human, from the depths of Warm Mineral Springs, the spa that bills itself as <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>'s `` fountain of youth. <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON>'s work as director of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s research project is examined in an episode of PBS' `` Discoveries Underwater,'' airing Monday The eight-part documentary series from <ORGANIZATION> KCET-TV </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> looks at shipwrecks, sunken treasures and the lost city of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>. The age of the bones in the Warm Mineral Springs sinkhole has been established by carbon dating at about 12,000 years. `` I feel early man used this place to dispose of the dead,'' said <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON>, a tall man with thick sandy hair and a big beard starting to show gray. `` We've found the remains of more than 20 men so far. We've also found the bones of a giant ground sloth, a saber-toothed cat, a North American horse and a type of camel related to the llama. `` The climate was much cooler then. There were no palm trees and very few pines. We've found trees down there, some nuts and pollen. What we're trying to do is understand the humans against this background.'' The human remains are Paleo-Indians. Based on their skeletons, they averaged about 5-foot-4 in height and 110 pounds in weight. <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> said the skulls resemble those found in a cave in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> more than those of southeastern Indians. The bones have been preserved because the water in the sinkhole has no oxygen. It is also very warm and has a high mineral content, thus attracting many people to it for bathing, despite the sulfurous smell. <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> has also pulled up relics from more recent times, including <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottles and a deer skull. `` My principal interest as an underwater archaeologist is looking for sites from the Ice Age that are now underwater,'' <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> said. `` Since the ice caps melted, the ocean level has risen 300 feet worldwide. We were looking in the wrong places to find early man. We should be looking for those sites that are now up to 300 feet beneath the ocean. `` This sinkhole was once a cave that collapsed about 30,000 years ago. Things have been falling into it since then. We're digging through many generations. Diving to the bottom of the hole, 230 feet down at its deepest, is dangerous and scary. It's pitch black at the bottom. It takes 93 minutes to decompress on the way up. Prior to coming to Warm Mineral Springs, <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s underwater archaeologist That was a job that put him in daily contact with underwater treasure salvagers, including <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who found the multimillion-dollar wreck of the Atocha. Not all salvagers are legitimate, <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> said. `` Most of the money in finding sunken treasure is made on dry land by people selling shares in shady salvage schemes,'' he said. `` There are also a lot of phony treasure maps for sale. We even found one that was copied from the placemat at a fast food restaurant. Some people are making big money selling cheap dental gold in bars to look like Spanish gold.'' <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> spent much of his time trying to preserve underwater wrecks from predatory salvagers. He is a strong supporter of a bill now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to protect underwater wrecks. `` This bill would preserve wrecks for sport divers to visit,'' he said. `` It would not prevent anyone from diving on a wreck. It would only prevent taking anything from a wreck without a permit. Legitimate salvagers would still be able to recover treasure.'' <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, has been diving since 1959. He originally began as a paleontologist but switched to archaeologist. `` My first dig was in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> for a zeuglodon, which was an ancient whale with a neck,'' he said. `` You find a lot of whale bones in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. People even used them for building houses.''

<TEXT>
 A high-tech human-powered aircraft made a successful series of test flights today in preparation for a world-record distance attempt that also will recreate the ancient Daedalus myth. But organizers of the Daedalus project called off plans for a record bid on Friday because southerly gales were expected with winds gusting up to 30 mph. Flight Director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussulari </PERSON> told reporters that the 68-pound ultralight <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 `` is in good shape ... and we may see favorable conditions'' for a flight on Saturday or Sunday. The aircraft completed six flights lasting less than three minutes each in calm dawn weather above a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> air force base adjoining <LOCATION> Iraklion </LOCATION> airport. Five athlete pilots took turns to pedal the shimmering pink-and-silver plane at speeds of around 14 mph, flying about 15 feet above the tarmac. The three-year <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> project aims at breaking the world record for human-powered flight over the 74-mile distance from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> to the island of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>, also known as Thira. The flight also will update the myth of <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>. According to the 3,500-year-old myth, the inventor and his son, Icarus, tried to escape from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> on wings made of feathers and wax. <PERSON> Daedalus </PERSON> succeeded, but <PERSON> Icarus </PERSON> flew too close to the sun, the wax melted and he fell into the sea. After nine days of blustery weather, conditions today appeared near-perfect for the <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> flight, which requires temperatures below 70 degrees Fahrenheit and almost dead calm, a rare occurrence on this wind-swept southern island. `` It feels like a day for the record, pretty calm. I was flying the plane with no hands,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Scioscia </PERSON>, 27, a professional cyclist from <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bussulari </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> aerospace expert who will make the decision to fly, said the record probably could have been set today, although the plane would have met strong headwinds about five miles off <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> `` But we felt we needed a test flight to shake down the aeroplane,'' he said. The pilots _ four Americans and one <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> _ are taking turns to stand by for 48 hours in readiness for the flight. The pilot who had been scheduled to fly Friday is <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, whose father was born in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The pilot pumps bicycle pedals that turn the contraption's propeller, and steers the plane with a joystick, coordinating with ground-based radio instructions `` For the record the pilot must keep pedaling a steady 15 mph but the effort is equivalent to riding 23 miles an hour on land,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremml </PERSON>, a medical student from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Tremml set the 37.2-mile world record for human-powered flight in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1987, flying a <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> prototype After an unassisted takeoff, the pilot will skirt the offshore island of <LOCATION> Dia </LOCATION> and head due north hoping to land on a sandy beach on <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>. Two Greek navy patrol boats and a flotilla of inflatable crafts will escort the plane across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> sea </LOCATION>, ready to pick up the pilot if he crashes and salvage the aircraft, although it probably would be unuseable. Two backup flying machines are ready for assembly here if needed. Like <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88, they are constructed of lightweight composite material _ graphite epoxy, plastic fiber and mylar, an extra-thin plastic skin that covers the jetliner-sized 112-foot wingspan. The $ 1 million Daedalus project, with its 36-member team, has produced new information on endurance and low altitude flying aerodynamics and meteorology during its three years of development, its organizers said. `` The project does have a research and educational application, particularly in human physiology and aeronautics,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, the project director. `` The plane itself does n't have any practical application. It should be seen as a work of art.''

 March roared out of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> like a lion today, pounding some areas with nearly two feet of snow and making travel treacherous on snowy and ice-packed roads throughout the state. The storm caused numerous minor accidents during the morning rush hour, giving motorists a longer-than-usual commute and creating visibilities of near zero at times. `` The roads will continue to be pretty nasty,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzinger </PERSON>. `` I guess we would say this is a worse-than-average storm.

 A leaky fuel pipe spilling oil onto a hot engine is believed to have triggered a fire that crippled the cruise ship Scandinavian Star earlier this month near <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>At Least 17 Killed As Tamils Attack Moslem Villages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tamil militants attacked and set fire to two Moslem fishing villages in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> today, and at least 17 people were killed, Indian and Sri Lankan sources said. The sources said the attackers burned a mosque and more than 80 mud-and-straw houses in villages near <LOCATION> Kalmunai </LOCATION>, 137 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Some reports said the death toll was higher. There also was confusion over how many of the dead were Tamils and how many were Moslems because a battle apparently broke out after the initial attack. Moslems make up 7 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They have been caught up only rarely in the Tamil rebels' nearly five-year war against the dominant Sinhalese for a separate Tamil nation. But the Moslems make up about one-third of the population in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, which the rebels want as part of their homeland, and they recently have come under attack. Under an Indian-sponsored peace accord, a vote is be held in the island's north and east for a temporary council to rule the two areas as one province. Both Sinhalese and Moslem leaders charge that the Tamils are trying to drive out members of the other two communities to gain political advantage. An Indian diplomat in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops investigating the attack found 17 bodies in the villages of <LOCATION> Sainthamaruthu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaiyandu </LOCATION>. The diplomat, who spoke on condition her name not be used, said six people also were injured. `` Indian troops have now moved a battalion to the stricken villages,'' she said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> mantains about 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> under a peace accord signed last July. A police official in <LOCATION> Kalmunai </LOCATION>, who also spoke anonymously, said 86 houses, all belonging to Moslem fisherman, were burned to the ground. Many people fled into the nearby jungle, he said. <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashroof </PERSON>, general secretary of the Sri Lankan Moslem <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> that he had firm reports the death toll was 20 Moslems, including six who perished after taking refuge in the mosque. But sources in the coastal city of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Kalmunai </LOCATION>, said survivors' accounts indicated 17 died, including seven Tamils killed when Moslem villagers tried to repulse the attack. The largest rebel militia, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, have been operating in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since being driven out of their stronghold in the north by Indian troops. They have resisted the peace accord, which calls on the rebels to give up their fight in exchange for more autonomy for Tamils. Tamils, mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the population. They claim they are discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who form 75 percent and dominate the government and military. Within the last month, nearly 150 civilians have been killed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> in attacks blamed on the Tamil rebels. Within the past week more than 30 Moslem-owned homes and businesses have been looted or set afire in <LOCATION> Kalmunai </LOCATION>. Two weeks ago seven Moslem businessmen in the area were kidnapped and are still missing.

 Twenty Polish Gypsies who were arrested at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> while carrying jewelry-stuffed bags are part of an elusive nationwide burglary ring, authorities said. Nineteen of the 20 men and women pleaded innocent in <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and Tuesday to charges of receiving stolen property. One suspect is still to be arraigned. Sheriff's Detective <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON>, who has tracked members of the group since 1984, said they specialized in rifling senior citizens' houses from coast to coast, often while the victims were at home Group members are wanted in connection with a string of similar burglaries across the country and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he said. `` We have n't even touched the tip of the iceberg, that's how big we believe this activity is across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Detective <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagele </PERSON>, working with more than two dozen law enforcement agencies in the case, said the Gypsies would drive through affluent neighborhoods looking for senior citizens standing outside their homes, watering their lawns or chatting with neighbors. While a man remained at the wheel of the car, a woman would ask the homeowner for directions or a drink of water. A second woman would sneak into the house and rummage through bedroom dressers and closets in search of jewelry, expensive heirlooms and silver, <PERSON> Kagele </PERSON> said. `` If the woman was seen inside the house, she would make up a quick story that she's looking for a ` Joe' or ` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>' and must have the wrong address,'' <PERSON> Kagele </PERSON> said. `` It was n't all that sophisticated, but it worked.'' Still wanted is the group's alleged Gypsy `` queen,'' <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON> <PERSON> Reszuta </PERSON>, 31, authorities said. All 20 people arrested last week have been charged with one count of receiving stolen property and held in lieu of $ 500,000 bail each. Police said the high bail was needed because alleged members of the group have fled before trial in the past. Polish translators are assisting the Gypsies because none of the 20 speak enough English to follow their court proceedings. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents also are reviewing their files on the suspicion that several may be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally.

<HEAD>Government Cancels Dam Project Near Prague</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has canceled a long-planned project to build a dam and hydroelectric power station in a river valley west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> because it would cause ecological damage, it was reported Thursday. Ecologists said it was the first case when a major project has been canceled for ecology reasons in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, expressing the growing official and popular concern over increased pollution, the Communist daily Rude Pravo reported. Serious objections to the Krivoklat dam, which was initiated in the 1960s, were raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and local officials, and that led to several postponements of the project. In 1977 the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declared that the area should be preserved. Flooding in the <LOCATION> Berounka </LOCATION> river valley would destroy fauna and flora surviving in the area since the Ice Age, as well as valuable forests which are to be used to revitalize the tens of thousands of acres of woods damaged by pollution in this country, ecologists say. The decision, however, was not expected to change official plans for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s most grandiose current project: the construction of a giant dam and hydroelectric plant on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> where it crosses the Hungarian border. Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists have said the project will alter water levels and damage forests and farmland across a wide area. But <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s planners are still going ahead with a plant they say will provide enough power to reduce the burning of sulfur-laden brown coal by 3.8 million tons a year. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> coal and other materials used to fuel a rapid 1950s industrialization inspired by the Soviets' Stalinist efforts have inflicted great damage on the environment in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a landlocked country whose natural assets are its forests and rivers. The damage grew unhindered throughout the 1970s, while the West woke up to ecological issues. Now, a similar consciousness has arisen in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, causing popular alarm and forcing the government to finance projects designed to restore environmental standards to 1970 levels by the next millenium.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> is calling on the nation to eat less meat and more vegetables because farmers ca n't grow enough grain to feed livestock. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, speaking Wednesday with delegates to the current session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should learn from developed countries, where nutritionists are discouraging excess consumption of meat. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s comments, carried Thursday by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, follow several articles in the official media warning that the rapid increase in meat consumption ca n't continue amid stagnating grain production. Since 1983, consumption of meat, poultry, eggs and fish has risen 10 percent annually while agricultural production has gone up only 2 percent or 3 percent a year. Last year, most large Chinese cities for the first time in decades began rationing pork, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s favorite meat, because farmers strapped by rising feed costs and low government prices for pigs were not meeting the rising demand for pork. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> backed up a statement by acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who in his report at the opening of the congress last week said that `` for a relatively long time, because of the restrictions imposed by the amount of grain held per capita, a major increase in supplies of meat, poultry, eggs and other animal food products will not be possible.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said the government should guide the eating habits of the nation just as it has held down population growth with its one child policy. `` Since we've made world-acknowledged achievements in family planning, why ca n't we guide the people in their food pattern?'' he said. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> suggested that higher prices for pork could be used to guide people to eat more chicken and rabbit than pork. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s grain production hit a record 407 million tons in 1984 but has failed to equal that since then. In the same period, grain consumption, largely because of increased demand for meat products, has increased by 15 million tons annually. The government must attain its optimistic goal of increasing grain production to 500 million tons by the year 2000 just to keep per-capita levels at the current 880 pounds because of population growth. Last year, the average Chinese ate a little more than 37 pounds of meat, including about 31 pounds of pork. The average American in 1984 consumed 143 -LCB- pounds of meat.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may start campaigning for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> early this summer, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today, giving his vice president an early start on the fall campaign.

Campaigning Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, he told a crowd at a church in the working-class city of <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION>: `` Some leaders do n't hold office. But leaders stand with the people in the hour of hardship and challenge.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained to reporters at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s remarks constituted an attack `` more personal than principled. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, passing through the same airport a short while later, took issue with that, and criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> anew. `` I think it's ridiculous,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said. `` He's a major contender for the White House Is he to be immune from any questioning of his position on the issues or his approach to the campaign? ... Is there a separate standard?'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had planned to meet Wednesday, but it fell through. In light of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s comments a day earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` It's not necessary to meet at this time.'' On Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had a `` complete and total lack'' of qualifications for the nation's highest office and criticized his foreign policy views. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ridiculed rival <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's hesitancy to spell out differences with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was `` ludicrous.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Wednesday night, replied: `` We can discuss issues without attacking each other ... -LRB- Voters -RRB- do n't want to know what <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> thinks of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been under pressure as a result of recent losses to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. But he managed to recoup with a solid 2-1 victory in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> primary. With that victory, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor again took the lead in the national delegate race. According to the latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 648.55, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 642.55, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 367.8 and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 169.5, with 488.6 uncommitted. Asked by reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Wednesday to detail the differences between himself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> answered cautiously. He mentioned disagreements over <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy and some domestic economic matters, but provided no specifics, saying he would discuss the matter more fully in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> speech later this week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hinted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lack of any experience in elective office ought to be considered by voters. But he quickly moved to stress that any disagreements he had with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had always been `` friendly and respectful.'' That attitude got <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s dander up. `` Is there supposed to be some unwritten rule why <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can not be criticized, why his positions have to be just sacrosanct, and nobody can say anything about them for fear somebody will just misinterpret what you're saying?'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, suggested that fear of alienating fervent <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters was keeping other candidates from engaging in any real rough-and-tumble with him. `` You have to be careful. You do n't want to be perceived as anti-black,'' the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been getting nearly unanimous black support in primary states, according to exit polls. A spokesman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said if the vice president faced <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the general election, he would have `` no reluctance'' to criticize him as warranted. `` If <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the nominee, we will feel very willing to attack him on the issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` There will be no reticence, there will be no reluctance.'' The vice president virtually locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination when his principal rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, left the race Tuesday. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is still formally in the running, but has acknowledged he's not likely to come from behind at this point. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has 813 delegates, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count, to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s 17. To nominate, 1,139 delegates are needed. With little to do but stay out of trouble, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to steer clear of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his problems. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> quit Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two left their jobs because they were concerned that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continuing legal difficulties were damaging the effectiveness and credibility of the department. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, however, said Wednesday he would not resign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was troubled by the resignations but added, `` I'm not going to pass judgment'' on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should go <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did say <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would not hold the top law enforcement post in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` It seems to me that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has to be above reproach. It is an agency that has special responsibility,'' he said. Republicans turned their attention to platform matters. The party opened platform hearings Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, focusing on foreign policy. The next hearing is scheduled May 31 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and another is set in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on June 30.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials point proudly to how many Latin American countries have become democratic in recent years, but on the hemispheric issues of most concern to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ it's hard to find one willing to align itself with American policy. On Tuesday, a day when the administration was issuing veiled warnings about the possibility of military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a regional conclave in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, decided that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had already gone too far in its campaign against military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We urge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to revoke immediately the coercive measures it has adopted against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique after a two-day meeting. Nations ranging from rightist <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Marxist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> signed the declaration. The underlying message was clear: the 26 countries are worried that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is setting a precedent in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that could be used against any one of them in the future. This consideration far outweighs the distaste that many have for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, named in two federal narcotics indictments. They believe they themselves might be an American target some day if they get caught smuggling drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or run afoul of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in some other way. Over the past month, the administration has contributed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic collapse through measures that have had the effect of aggravating an acute cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It has, for example, taken steps to deny <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> access to some $ 50 million in official Panamanian funds deposited in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and has withheld a $ 6.5 million payment due to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for services related to <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> operations. But many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is virtually unanimous, believe the administration has not gone far enough. Some advocate a comprehensive trade embargo. The administration has moved against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the name of restoring democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but none of the democracies which now dominate the hemisphere has seen fit to back the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions. The one source of comfort for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> concerning <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is that the only nations that have provided overt support for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Another frustration for the administration has been the persistent refusal of Latin American nations to support the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Some countries, such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, have fought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy since the beginning while many others finessed the issue by refusing to take a stand. Asked for an explanation, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say many nations have expressed support for the Contras in private but refuse to do so publicly. The reason, officials say, is that these countries fear a left-wing backlash at home if they side with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. To ensure domestic tranquility, disassociation from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has been a time-honored tactic. All this generates considerable hand-wringing among administration officials. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was once routinely accused of backing unpopular dictators against the wishes of their subjects. But, particularly in the case of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not been able to count on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support even when it takes an assertive stand against a strongman like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. A generation ago, it was relatively easy for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to win diplomatic support in the hemisphere. With minimal opposition, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> orchestrated the diplomatic and economic isolation of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s revolutionary government and won <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support, with some exceptions, for its armed intervention in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1965. The sole recent instance in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have been in harmony was in 1979, when there was a common effort to bring down the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family dynasty in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration called on President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> to step down and, within a month, he was gone.

 Prostitutes are masquerading as schoolgirls to lure clients wary of getting infected with AIDS, the head of <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s task force on the disease said Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The soap opera `` General Hospital'' celebrates its 25th anniversary on Friday showing no signs of ill health in the Nielsen ratings, a recovery that began when it went on location and added such contemporary anti-heroes as <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>. The show, which began as a straightforward hospital drama on April 1, 1963, was almost dead in the ratings when <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> took over as executive producer in 1978, infusing the show with contemporary plots and characters. Since 1979, it has been consistently No. 1 in daytime. In 1981, the wedding of shady characters <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> attracted an audience of nearly 17 million people _ in prime time, the equivalent might be a combination of a Super Bowl and the `` Who Shot J.R.?'' episode of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' The show was so popular, even <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> did a guest shot. A popular song was inspired _ `` General Hospi-tale.'' For the first quarter of 1988, `` General Hospital'' tied with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Young and the Restless'' for first place in the daytime Nielsens, with an average rating of 8.6 and 27 share. The rating is a percentage of 88.6 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households with televisions. The share is a percentage of the sets in use. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beradino </PERSON>, as Dr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, as nurse <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, have been with the show since it began. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, who joined the next year as <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, also still appears. Under <PERSON> Monty </PERSON>'s guidance the show was expanded to an hour and took on action-oriented storylines that turned it into a pop phenomenon. `` General Hospital'' was one of the first daytime dramas to go on location, shorten scenes to quicken the pacing and introduce more contemporary characters. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, who had produced <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Young and the Restless'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Days of Our Lives,'' took over as executive producer when <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> left a year ago. `` ` General Hospital' is an adventure-driven show that also depends heavily on its characters,'' said <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>. `` Lots of shows rely on character and romance, but what <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> introduced was adventure and suspense, which no soap had ever done before. Another thing <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> introduced was remotes -LRB- location shooting -RRB-. Last year we did more than 17. We got to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>. We blew up a whole mountain in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>. We had a snow storm at Big Bear. `` There's a tendency for all soaps to go on location, but I think ` <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>' has carried it out more successfully. We use the remotes to push the story ahead rather than just as an excuse to get out of the studio.'' Since the departure of actors <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Geary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> as <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, no one has heated up the airwaves the way they did. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> were a departure from the good vs. evil staple of daytime drama. They became magazine-cover heroes, even though <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> once killed off an old boyfriend, and when she was raped, the culprit turned out to be <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>. Among characters who now populate `` General Hospital'' are: _ The menage a trois of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorpio </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tristan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Devane </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Finola </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> -RRB-, and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Scorpio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> were once married and had a child, but <PERSON> Scorpio </PERSON> later married <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Samms </PERSON>, before she went to `` Dynasty'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> are now married, but there is a continuing competition for <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> by the two men. _ <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeman </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> -LRB- Kin Shriner -RRB-. Troublemaker <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has just returned to the show and renewed his relationship with <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herring </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and her husband <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Maule </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, who had been an in-house villain, has turned around with her marriage to surgeon <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Some people still do n't like her, but her marriage gives her respect _ <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Malandro </PERSON> -RRB- has not had a relationship since the departure of <LOCATION> Frisco </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> -RRB- a year ago. <LOCATION> Frisco </LOCATION> is supposedly away on a spy mission, but now that it appears <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> will not return, the writers will involve her in another relationship. Her new story will center on her search for <LOCATION> Frisco </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> -RRB- has returned to the show and married <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravelle </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> -RRB- in the first interracial marriage on a soap opera. `` I think people like stories that continue so they can relate to these people,'' said <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>. `` They become like a family, and the viewer becomes emotionally involved. There seem to be two attitudes by viewers. One, that the stories are similar to what happened to them in real life, or two, thank goodness that is n't me.

 Television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> reportedly said preacher <PERSON> Oral </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> freed him of `` demons with long fingernails'' digging into his body before <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> decided to defy his church and return to the pulpit. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, accused of motel trysts with a prostitute, intends to return to the pulpit May 22, three months after stepping down, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>, his lawyer and a board member of <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said several weeks ago that he has undergone extensive prayer and counseling with <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Euless </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s friend and a fellow TV evangelist, said in a television interview Wednesday. `` And he said to me that <PERSON> Oral </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> called him up and told him that he saw demons with long fingernails digging their flesh into <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s body and that he cast those demon spirits out of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WFAA </ORGANIZATION> he did not know whether <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' counseling led to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s plans to resume preaching May 22, but said that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> feels the process has freed him of his sin. `` I am proud to confirm that,'' Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, told the television station. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, said today that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had spoken to the evangelist only once. `` Rev. Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is one of hundreds and hundreds of ministers who have called Rev. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> to pray with him and he deeply appreciates those calls,'' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said. `` He spoke to Rev. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> about four weeks ago and that was the only time he called him.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s return May 22 coincides with the end of a three-month suspension by the church's <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> council. The national church's General Presbytery on Tuesday overruled that term as too lenient and barred him from the pulpit for at least a year and ordered him to undergo two years of rehabilitation and counseling <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON> said there was a conflict within the Assemblies, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, over whether the national presbytery or the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> council has the right to discipline ministers. `` He is willing to submit himself to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON> told a televised news conference at <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s headquarters here. `` He will be considering an appeal to the national Presbytery.'' However, <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the national office of the Assemblies in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s option to return after three months `` does not exist anymore.'' `` The General Presbytery overwhelmingly and without a dissenting vote affirmed the authority of the Executive Presbytery to make decisions on matters concerning ministerial credentials,'' she said Wednesday. The 13-member Executive Presbytery acts as the church's board of directors, while the 232-member General Presbytery is its oversight body. The Rev. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, the Assemblies' general superintendent, said Tuesday that if <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not accept its ruling, `` the Executive Presbytery would no doubt take action to dismiss him.'' Church officials originally said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had 30 days to appeal the terms of his rehabilitation. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said Wednesday church bylaws provide for an appeal only in cases of dismissal, not suspension. Asked if a year away from the pulpit would ruin <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lucrative ministry, <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON> said, `` He is weighing all those considerations very carefully. The ministry has said it took in $ 150 million in 1986 from its worldwide operations, including sales. It contributes an estimated $ 12 million a year to the Assemblies' foreign missions program. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Assemblies officials have close ties to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s church, television and Bible school enterprise <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Janway </PERSON>, superintendent of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district, also sits on the board of <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>. Although the Executive Presbytery interrupted its regular bimonthly meeting to watch <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>'s news conference, `` We do n't consider that we've heard from <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, because we do n't communicate through television news conferences with our disciplined ministers,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> tearfully stepped down from the pulpit on Feb. 21 after confessing an unspecified sin. Church officials later said they had seen photographs of the evangelist with a prostitute in a motel room. According to the Presbytery's terms of rehabilitation, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> must stop preaching and distributing videotaped sermons for at least one year, and undergo counseling and supervision by church elders for two years. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is the latest evangelist to be forced from the pulpit. His accuser, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, was forced from the Assemblies of God when he admitted to an immoral act with a woman. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> were forced from their <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in a scandal that included a sexual encounter between <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>.

 A house painter who was stabbed when he tried to help a woman he thought was being raped has received gifts of food and money and offers of a job. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON>, 27, has also gotten phone calls offering him encouragement and a check, accompanied by a short letter that said, `` You qualify to get to heaven.'' Most importantly, <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON> said, the admirers have rebuilt his morale. <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON> was stabbed March 5 after he tried to break up a dispute between a man and woman outside his apartment building. <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON>, who said he thought the woman was being raped, was stabbed by the man three times. Authorities said there was not enough evidence to charge <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON>'s attacker. <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON> has no insurance to cover his medical bills, and his pregnant wife, <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON>, is not working. He is not eligible for unemployment benefits. Almost four weeks after he was stabbed in his shoulder and abdomen, <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON> still groans with pain when he pushes himself up from the couch. But since his story appeared March 15 in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coloradoan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Botsford </PERSON>'s wounds _ and his pride _ have started to heal. Admirers have sent $ 170, and one man offered him a sales job. Another note said, `` Give me a ring if you ca n't get a job.'' An anonymous writer said, `` I appreciate your efforts to help. I hope someone like you is around if one of my daughters are ever in trouble.''

 Two prosecutors involved in a high-speed chase have resigned in the wake of accusations that the driver was semi-nude and tried to intimidate officers who stopped her. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Janine </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamping </PERSON>, 32, was stopped March 20 and cited for allegedly fleeing and attempting to elude police in a chase through <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Her passenger, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, 27, was n't charged. Police said they did n't ask Ms. <PERSON> Bamping </PERSON> to get out of the car for a sobriety test because she was undressed from the waist down. <PERSON> Belvins </PERSON> was fully clothed, officers said. When asked while she was only partially clothed, she became angry, flashed her state prosecutor's badge and used the name of a county judge suggesting retribution against them, the officers said. Ms. <PERSON> Bamping </PERSON> was suspended with pay last week while State Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> was on vacation. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> met with the assistants Monday and accepted their resignations Wednesday. `` Both are competent prosecutors and their work will be missed,'' <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> said in a statement. He said he has asked the governor's office to assign an outside state attorney to review the charges, which Ms. <PERSON> Bamping </PERSON> apparently intends to fight. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> heads a staff of 46 assistants in the 12th Judicial Circuit of three counties.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Government Will Repatriate Remains of 27 Americans</HEAD>

 The Vietnamese government has informed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it will repatriate the remains of what it believes may be 27 American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today. The remains will be delivered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on April 6 and transported to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for identification, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appreciates the initiative taken by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue,'' the Pentagon said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the repatriation would be the largest single such transfer of remains since the end of the war. The largest previous tranfer occurred on Aug. 14, 1985, when the Vietnamese returned 26 remains. There are currently 2,404 Americans still listed as missing in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,767 are listed as missing in either North or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The remains of 152 Americans have been repatriated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and subsequently identified by the laboratory since the end of the war. On March 2, the Vietnamese turned over 17 remains to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Those remains have yet to be identified, however. The upcoming transfer would be the fourth since retired Army Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last August as a special presidential emissary, hoping to step up the process of accounting for missing Americans. `` We've continued to press the Vietnamese and we are getting some results,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said today. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could explain the sudden increase in repatriations, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> replied: `` It's really not for us to do that. The Vietnamese are the ones who should be explaining to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and to the world what happened to the rest of the remains and where they are.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the Vietnamese government notified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during technical meetings in mid-March that they were investigating 29 new reports of remains being found or information regarding servicemen uncovered. Earlier this week, the Vietnamese informed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it did have 27 remains to repatriate, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said.

 Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April through June across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other Tornado Alley states in the nation's heartland. From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118 tornadoes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> per year, according to the state climatologist's office in College Station More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June, records show. In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoes occur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the most unstable, that average increases to about 36. A few twisters were already recorded in early March in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but they did little or no damage. A tornado that touched down Tuesday in central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, near Bunkie, destroyed two brick homes. `` People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes. If they wait until it gets there, it's going to be too late,'' said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, a forecaster with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Saragosa </LOCATION>, killing 30 people and injuring 162. In mid-November, 11 people died in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> when a series of tornadoes trashed towns from <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to the Gulf Coast. `` A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm. No matter how much preparation you do there is some property damage and some loss of life. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself and property,'' said <PERSON> Laureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernow </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the governor's division of emergency management. One is to know the difference between the tornado watches and tornado warnings issued by the weather service. A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of a tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential funnel clouds. A tornado warning means one has already developed and has been spotted. Take cover immediately and do n't go outside, but if you are in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in the nearest ditch or depression. At home, the best place to stay is a basement or underground storm shelter. If no such shelter is available, go inside a closet in the center of the house or bathroom or lie flat under a heavy table. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flying debris, so `` we tell people to squat down, cover their heads and present a low profile.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says many people mistakenly try to outrun tornadoes in their cars. During the 1979 <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> tornado that killed 53, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said, `` people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at 90 mph.'' Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister. Another misconception is about opening windows. It was once believed that windows needed to be open to equalize air pressure between the storm and the inside of a house to prevent the house from exploding. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said there are enough natural openings in a house to equalize air pressure, and `` if that tornado wants to open your windows, it'll do that for you.''

 The White House today hailed the advancement of a new arms treaty in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and said there is a good possibility it will be ratified by the time President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for summit talks. Democratic vote-counters said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will easily approve the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons, despite Republican complaints over an amendment limiting future presidential interpretations of the agreement. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., No 2 in the Democratic leadership, said his counts show no more than five of the 100 senators are likely to vote against the pact. Ratification requires approval of 67 senators. `` I think there will be hurdles, but I do n't expect it to be turned down,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> offered their assessments shortly after the Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the pact Wednesday on a 17-2 vote that included the support of 10 Democrats and seven Republicans. Only Sens. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, voted against the treaty. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was `` a very good action. ... We're hopeful for good, strong floor debate and passage as soon as possible. `` We certainly would like to have the treaty ratified before we go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the summit and it looks like that's a good possibility,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 29 and remain there until June 2. The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, requires both sides to destroy all nuclear-armed missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. Among the weapons that will destroyed are the Soviet force of 650 SS-20s and other medium-range weapons aimed at western European targets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will give up <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> II </LOCATION> missiles stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and ground-launched cruise missiles stationed in five <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. The pact is the first in the history of arms control to require the actual destruction of the missiles that carry nuclear warheads. It is also the first to require on-site inspection to verify compliance. `` For the first time since <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, you see the number of weapons going down,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>. The treaty will probably come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor by late April and when it does, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said, the most contentious issue will be the Democratic-backed amendment. The amendment says that a future president can not change the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intepretation of the treaty without congressional approval. The fight stems from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assertion that he can unilaterally change the interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a view challenged by congressional Democrats. Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., a supporter of the pact, called the amendment `` a great mistake'' and said, `` it very frankly may change my position in response to the treaty'' on the floor <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> predicted the amendment `` will lead to the defeat of this treaty entirely because -LRB- with it -RRB-, the votes are n't there.'' The Foreign Relations vote was the third overwhelming endorsement given the pact by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved it and the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted in favor by an 18-2 margin. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> did express some concerns, and <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, tried to answer those fears Wednesday in testimony before the Foreign Relations panel. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said `` futuristic'' weapons such as lasers and particle beam generators are banned by the treaty if they are carried on `` weapons delivery vehicles'' within the prohibited range. The Soviets `` understand that all future -LRB- weapons -RRB- systems falling within the criteria will be banned,'' he told <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. And if an unarmed medium-range missile were to strike and destroy a target through impact alone, it would be considered a weapon if it had been designed for that purpose, he said. But Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said he did n't think <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>'s comments had settled the issue <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he would seek a more definitive clarification during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he might seek an amendment to the treaty requiring the administration to obtain a specific statement from the Soviets acknowledging that they had agreed not to produce, deploy or flight test futuristic medium-range weapons.

<HEAD>Raising Stamp Prices: How It's Done</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New postal rates taking effect Sunday complete a complex process that got under way 11 months ago. While most of the attention on the new 25-cent stamp has occurred in the last few weeks, the rate was actually proposed by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service in May 1987. Since then, there has been so much discussion that some consumers may be confused about how many times rates have risen, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Griesemer </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. When it was made an independent federal agency in the early 1970s, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was directed to break even by raising rates to cover costs. The taxpayer subsidy that had been provided to the old Post Office was gradually eliminated. But to prevent sudden, sharp rate hikes, a separate <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was set up to monitor mailing costs. Under the law, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> balances its funds over a term of years. When losses accumulate it raises rates. Subsequently it may show a surplus for some years, until costs rise to push it back into the red and again result in another hike. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 223 million in fiscal 1987, and the red ink was expected to increase this year despite cost-cutting efforts. The agency had a $ 305 million surplus in 1986, following sharp cost-cutting in the wake of 1985's loss of $ 251 million, agency managers reported. Surpluses were reported in 1984, 1983 and 1982, following rate increases in 1981. After the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> proposed new rates last May, the case went to the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is charged with listening to all interested persons and recommending whether the new rates should take effect. The commission has 10 months to reach a decision, which then goes back to the postal Board of Governors. The commission issued its ruling March 4, three days early. That decision on a rate hike, which was close to the original request, was then ordered into effect by the postal governors.

 Americans are paying more to laugh less. But do n't worry, the presidential election campaign should produce some cheap chuckles. The 1988 Cost of Laughing Index, released to coincide with April Fool's Day and adjusted for inflation, showed a 5.8 percent increase in the humor scale over last year. The annual index, which measures 18 leading humor indicators, compares the punch line to the bottom line. It showed the wholesale price of rubber chickens increased $ 4.80 per dozen during the past 12 months. `` The trend in playful poultry is particularly worrisome,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON>, a self-described humor consultant who compiled the index. `` Over the past two years, rubber chickens prices have jumped 23 percent and dancing chicken telegrams have risen by 9 percent. `` Funny fowl may soon become a memory for most American consumers.'' Other increases included an 8 percent hike in comedy club ticket prices and an 11 percent jump in the newstand price of Mad Magazine. On the up side, the wholesale price of Groucho glasses and arrow-through-the-head gags did not change. Former attorney <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON>, whose consulting operation is based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, also gives seminars on how to use humor to communicate.

 A man trying to return a neighbor's escaped pet wound up like an amateur facing pro wrestlers <PERSON> Hulk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> the Giant _ he was pinned on the first fall by a 700-pound wrestling bear <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> animal warden, opened his door Wednesday when he heard a noise on his porch and spotted his neighbor's trained and declawed black bear, Smoky. He realized Smoky apparently had broken out of his cage and took some apples to lure him back home. The 7-foot-tall bear just tripped him and sat on him. `` The bear thought it was a wrestling match,'' said <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Abicht </PERSON>. The bear performs under the stage name <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> at taverns or social events and wrestles with anyone who thinks they can beat him. When authorities tried to remove Smoky from <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION>'s yard in this <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb, the bear would n't even budge for four <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies, three or four policemen from <LOCATION> Strongsville </LOCATION> and two officers from Olmsted Falls. So they tied him to a tree with a rope until they located Smoky's owner, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzola </PERSON>. Then, `` they gave him some peanut butter or something and lured him into a trailer'' used to transport him, <PERSON> Abicht </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abicht </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mazzola </PERSON> quarreled with a game warden at the scene and was charged with obstructing official business. He was freed on $ 1,500 bond.

<TEXT>
 A 1709 Stradivarius violin named in honor of English concert musician <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was sold Thursday for $ 889,240, the highest auction price ever paid for a musical instrument. The violin, acquired by Miss Hall in 1905, was bought by an unidentified South American dealer, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s reported. The dealer beat out two other foreign rivals bidding by telephone in a tense, two-minute auction. The previous highest auction price for a violin by Italian craftsman <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Stradivari </PERSON> was $ 728,000. `` The Colossus,'' dated 1716, was bought last year by Italian violinist <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON>. The Guinness Book of Records says the highest known price for a Stradivarius is $ 1.2 million, but that was in a private sale of <PERSON> Stradivari </PERSON>'s `` Alard'' violin by British dealers W.E. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and Sons to a <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> dealer. Bidding started Thursday at $ 470,000, said <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> McHattie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, considered one of the finest violinists of her era, died at age 72 in 1956. British composer <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> dedicated his `` The Lark Ascending'' to her, and she first performed it on her Stradivarius in 1920. Miss Hall bequeathed the violin, previously known as the `` Viotti'' after <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Battista </PERSON> <PERSON> Viotti </PERSON>, to her daughter. The owner who sold it on Thursday was not identified. The instrument was last auctioned in 1968, when it sold for $ 52,600 _ a record at the time. Thursday's auction `` was quite drawn out and tense and there was a round of applause at the end,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McHattie </PERSON>. `` We're absolutely delighted to be the record holders again. The violin, kept in very good condition, had been expected to fetch up to $ 846,000, she said. It has a distinctive tiger-stripe wood grain pattern and is varnished in a rich orange-brown color. About 700 of 1,116 violins by <PERSON> Stradivari </PERSON> have survived.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his grip now firm on the Republican presidential nomination, is shifting his focus to the fall election amid speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will resign to oversee his campaign. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sources suggested that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ally, likely would not make such a move before the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15-18, despite the withdrawal this week of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s exit from the race, virtually guaranteeing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, heightened expectations that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> might speed up a decision to join the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team. But a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, commenting only on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday there was no truth to suggestions that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> might resign as early as August 1. The official would not elaborate. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> intends to participate in the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> in late June, administration officials said. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may begin campaigning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even before the party convention, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The White House had previously said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would remain neutral until the convention. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that policy is being reconsidered `` in view of the way the campaign has developed, and in view of the vice president's now seemingly assured nomination.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has longstanding ties to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and managed his 1980 presidential bid. He also was chairman of President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 1976 camaign and senior adviser to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman, said a discussion of what role <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> might play in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, if any, was only speculative at this time. However, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> added, `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> is very close to the vice president and has been for a quarter of a century. There's no secret what their relationship has been.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> could probably have any job in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency that he wanted, and there have been rumors for some time that he would like to be secretary of state rather than continue on as treasury secretary _ even though he has built an international reputation in his current post and appears to enjoy the job. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday told reporters he intended to `` have a new Cabinet'' if elected. The answer responded specifically to a query on embattled Atty. Gen. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> but might also be taken as a signal that there would be a new treasury secretary in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> became treasury secretary in 1985 after four years as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday after a three-day swing through <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. He scaled back campaign stops in that state, which holds its primary election next Tuesday, after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s withdrawal <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had his regular weekly lunch with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know if campaign plans were discussed. The president's spokesman said a decision on any presidential campaign activity in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf before the convention `` has not been finally made, although ... the vice president is very close to having the nomination.'' `` <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is still a candidate, in a declared sense, but he too recognizes the realities of the situation,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 A woman who concealed her husband's death for eight years and tended the corpse as if it were alive pleaded guilty today to a felony forgery charge stemming from the death. But a former Chicago-area dentist accused of assisting her in the forgery pleaded innocent and a jury trial was ordered. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 42, entered her plea today in <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before Associate Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulkeley </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was sentenced to two years probation and 12 days in the county jail, for which she received credit for 12 days already served. Officials said Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> still faces a hearing on child neglect charges involving her two children, who are in foster care. Besides probation, <PERSON> Bulkeley </PERSON> ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to undergo a psychiatric examination and told her to have no further contact with her alleged partner in the deception, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, 56, a former <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> dentist. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, in a brief appearance today before Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathers </PERSON>, pleaded innocent and left the courtroom. He still awaits a court appearance on a felony charge of cruelty to children. In February, Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> both pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> to misdemeanor charges of failing to report the May 1979 death of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a diabetic who authorities say died shortly after he joined a holistic health cult and stopped taking his daily insulin shots. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>'s withered corpse was found Jan. 29 on a bed in the home, where officials said his widow had cared for the body daily over the past eight years, changing its clothes and moving it from room to room. Following their guilty pleas on the misdemeanor charges, both Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> also faced felony forgery charges. Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was accused of fabricating a power of attorney for her dead husband in 1984. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who was a guest in the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> house the past year, was charged with forgery for signing his name to the document as a witness. Last week, <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> asked a judge to withdraw his guilty plea on the charge of failure to report <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' death. The hearing on <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>'s request was postponed until late April.

<HEAD>One Year After Nuke Shutdown, Plant Appeals Directly To Public</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In the year since <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottom </ORGANIZATION> became the first nuclear plant shut down because workers slept on the job, shareholders have absorbed $ 72 million in replacement energy costs, its operator said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said in a blunt `` open letter'' to civic and governmental organizations in southeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> that the episode has been `` an embarassment'' and that the plant would not restart until the company is `` completely satisfied'' conditions had changed. On March 31, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottom </ORGANIZATION> closed indefinitely, citing a pattern of control room operators dozing on duty and saying continued operation posed `` an immediate threat to health and safety.'' `` To date, the shutdown has caused the company's shareholders to absorb approximately $ 72 million of higher replacement energy costs, while the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ordered PE customers' rates to be reduced by $ 30.4 million per year until restart,'' <ORGANIZATION> PE </ORGANIZATION> said in the letter. `` There is no question that the public confidence has been shaken as the result of this shutdown and this is the type of communication with the public that will begin to rebuild that,'' <ORGANIZATION> PE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. The letter was signed by PE President and Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON>, who took over three weeks ago, after <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> resigned in the face of mounting criticism over <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottom </ORGANIZATION>'s restart. <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON> blamed problems at Peach Bottom in part on a lack of leadership by senior managers and a stagnant `` culture'' at the plant that was devoid of individual accountability and open communication. Since the shutdown, PE has proposed reorganizing work crews, removed all supervisors who were at the plant one year ago, hired a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rear admiral as plant manager, instituted a new training program for operators, and fired four employees and suspended seven others for drug-related activities. Most of the drug problems were said to be with maintenance workers. PE officials hope Peach Bottom, near the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> border, will be restarted this fall. But officials must first apply to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> regional office, and the regional office would inform the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when it was convinced the plant was ready.

 Former presidential aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> should be imprisoned because he showed a `` total lack of remorse'' when convicted of illegally lobbying the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said today in court papers. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> receive a prison term for three counts of violating the Ethics in Government Act to `` impress present and former government employees, as well as the general public that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended those restrictions be taken seriously and that they will be enforced with meaningful penalties.'' The prosecutor noted that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 63, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director, likened his crime to `` running a stop sign'' following his conviction Feb. 11 on three counts of illegal lobbying his former agency within a year of leaving government. `` Since being found guilty, defendant <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> has made a number of remarks showing a total lack of remorse or contrition for his offenses,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said in a sentencing memo to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>. `` That intransigent attitude is a consideration arguing in favor of a sentence that includes a period of incarceration,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. As further evidence of <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s lack of contrition, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> quoted a Feb. 18 letter to the court in which <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> wrote: `` I have never thought, and I do not think today, that I am guilty morally, ethically or legally of the crimes of which I am convicted.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> is scheduled to be sentenced April 8 and could receive two-year prison terms and a $ 10,000 fine for each of the three convictions of illegally lobbying on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-10 anti-tank plane. In addition to an unspecified prison term, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> recommended `` that an appropriate fine be imposed for each violation and that the fines be imposed cumulatively for the three violations.'' `` <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s special entree to the most powerful officials in government, including the president himself, epitomized the very danger to public perception about the integrity of governmental decision-making that motivated <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact the one-year no-contact prohibition,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also dismissed <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s argument that he misunderstood the ethics law, saying he had received a White House manual that instructed all members of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff to review carefully the rules on post-employment lobbying. In addition, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> received extensive legal advice from a private law firm about the law, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. The sentencing memo referred to an incident in which <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> allegedly uttered a profanity when told by one of his lawyers not to make any White House contacts `` without first clearing it with his lawyers.'' During a bench conference out of hearing of jurors and the public, Associate Independent Counsel <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> told the judge that after responding with a profanity, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said `` these are my friends and I am going back to them if I want to'', according to the memo. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> noted that `` defense counsel has attempted to minimize the significance of this episode by asserting that defendant <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s profanity in response to his lawyer's advice was characteristic of their client's jocularity. `` Perhaps so,'' the sentencing memo continued. `` But his lawyers at the time took the incident seriously. They have told staff members of the independent counsel that this episode caused concern'' within the law firm. `` Whatever his choice of words, however, it is evident that defendant <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was alerted to and deliberately chose to ignore written and oral advice that Section 207 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- of the law -RRB- applied to him,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. During the trial, defense lawyers unsuccessfully sought to claim that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> had acted with the advice of his counsel when he lobbied the White House on behalf of at least one client. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> refused to allow the defense to raise this argument, saying it was legally impermissible.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may go on the road to campaign for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before the GOP convention to give his vice president an edge going into the fall campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The move indicates that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is ending his official neutrality in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race before the party's convention, scheduled for Aug. 15-18 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I just want to signal you that that is changing,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` The president has always been ready,'' the spokesman said. `` He's ready at the drop of a hat to get out there on the road. He's ready to get into the campaign at any point.'' However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The president has always wanted to get involved in the political process as soon as possible. It's simply that his position on neutrality required that that could not happen until after the convention. He said the president `` could decide to do some events earlier'' in the light of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s string of primary and caucus victories, which have forced all other Republican candidates except the badly lagging <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> from the field. `` I think that in view of the way the campaign has developed, and in view of the vice president's now seemingly assured nomination, that we would rethink that situation in view of those new realities, and that we could see the president involved in some political activities before the nominating convention _ activities that are directly associated with the nominee,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a decision `` has not been finally made, although every one is aware ... that the reality of the situation is such that the vice president is very close to having the nomination.'' `` <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is still a candidate, in a declared sense, but, he, too recognizes the realities of the situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more than 800 of the 1,139 needed to win the nomination, according to a count by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has 17. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was having his regular weekly lunch with the president Thursday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know what they planned to talk about. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no decision had been made on an endorsement, and no events had been scheduled or were expected to be scheduled soon. `` I simply want to open the door to this new prospect,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination in 1980, has often spoken of him in glowing terms, ranking him at or near the top among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vice presidents.

<HEAD>Northeast Slipping to Least Populated Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The densely settled Northeast has become the nation's least populated region, falling behind the West for the first time, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The bureau also projected that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will surpass <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for second place behind <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in population by 1995. And between now and the year 2000, half of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population growth will occur in just three states: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the report said. The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births, deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureau demographer <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetrogen </PERSON> explained. The Northeast has been declining in its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, with less growth than other areas, <PERSON> Wetrogen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It is the one region with the highest share of population in the older ages, and has low birth rates.'' Population shifts to the South and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent years have drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, `` so the -LRB- Northeast -RRB- region is left with more older people, and it's left without anybody to have more kids,'' she said. The Northeastern states, relatively smaller in land area than other parts of the country, remain the mosty densely packed, however. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> leads the nation with more than 1,000 people per square mile. Between 1987 and 1988, the Western region increased from 49.6 million people to 50.5 million, the report said. At the same time, the population of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> edged upward from 50.1 million to 50.3 million, to slip into last place. The 1988 estimates listed the South with 85.1 million people, followed by the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with 59.6 million. Historical records show that, while it was the center of early American development, the Northeast has n't actually been the most populous region since 1820, when the South edged ahead. It remained second until 1880, falling to third behind both the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South. By 1990, the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million people, followed by the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million; and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, 50.6 million. By 2000, the counts are expected to be 96.9 million for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, 59.6 million for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 59.4 million for the West and 51.8 million for the Northeast. By 2010, the report added, the West could replace the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as the second-most-populous region. State population projections showed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> remaining unchallenged as the largest state, growing from 28 million people today to 29.1 million in 1990 and 33.5 million in 2000. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is expected to surpass <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for second rank by 1995. The Empire State now leads <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 17.7 million to 17.2 million, but by 1995 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is projected to have just over 19 million people, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at only 17.9 million. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is expected to remain the fourth-largest state, although by the year 2010 it may be closing in on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as well, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. By the year 2000, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> will have replaced <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in fifth place and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> will move into 10th, displacing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the report said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population was projected to grow from 243.3 million in 1987 to 267.7 million in 2000. In that period, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is expected to add 6 million residents, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> 3.5 million and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 3.3 million. That means those states would have growth of 12.8 million people, 52 percent of the national increase of 24.4 million. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were projected to lose population this decade. Population losses in the 1990s were predicted for nine more states: <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. On the other hand, growth was predicted to resume in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. During the 1990s, the maturing of the post-World War II Baby Boom generation will be reflected in the growth of the 45-64 age group in all parts of the country. The number of people aged 24 to 44 is expected to drop in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> but grow elsewhere, the report said. The study said the South continues to have the largest percentage of blacks in its population, 16 percent. More than half of all black Americans reside in the South, and that is expected to continue.

 A relative of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s revered pacifist revolutionary, <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, is working to erect memorials to him in 15 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, but <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is having a little trouble finding a spot for its monument. The inspiration and money is coming from a foundation created by <PERSON> Yoges </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, a grandnephew of the man who led <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to independence in 1947 with non-violent protests. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said Wednesday he chose this city of monuments to revolutionary heroes as one of the 15 cities because he wants to remind people to be better to one another. `` The statue of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> will encourage people to follow the path of non-violence. We do n't want to focus on the man, but what he has done,'' said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The founder and president of the 5-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Gandhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said he already has $ 250,000 for the project. He wants the statues erected by Oct. 2 for a national celebration of the 119th anniversary of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s birth. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials from Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> on down have welcomed the memorial. But finding a site for the statue or monument is a problem, because of the city's current state of construction upheaval, from its roads to its skyline. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> is executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that decides what monuments look like and where they go. She said the five-member panel is leaning toward a bas relief that would include text to better convey <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s message Mrs. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said the site should be worked out within the next few weeks and the design selected by May. A statue of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is not incongruous for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where Revolutionary War generals are remembered as well as abolitionists and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> devotee <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. Two years ago the foundation erected a statue of <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Union Square. Other cities on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s list are <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and, in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A 77-year-old widower who lives in a tiny mobile home and depends on a bicycle for transportation has collected about $ 21,000 in interest from a long-ignored savings account. `` I did n't forget about it,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON> said. `` That's why you put money in a bank _ to let it collect interest.'' <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON> closed his account at <ORGANIZATION> OneBank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> on Wednesday, saying he did n't want to pedal 30 miles from <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> to keep tabs on it. <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON>, a retired electrical engineer and former hobo, had been told by the state auditor's office that his $ 34,482.29 in savings was in danger of government seizure because of a lack of account activity. <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON> said the last bank statement he received showed a balance of about $ 13,500. That was in 1972. The statements stopped because he did n't give the bank his change of address. The state auditor's staff says $ 750,000 has n't been claimed by nearly 2,500 people whose accounts or other scheduled transactions, like utility deposits, have been inactive for at least seven years. The office is conducting a drive, called the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION>, to notify owners of such accounts under a 1987 law which mandates that money from such accounts that is unclaimed by April 7, 1990, goes into state general revenues. <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON>'s balance was the largest unclaimed amount, the auditor's office said. A news report about the notification drive caught the attention of a teller at <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON>'s bank in <LOCATION> Conway </LOCATION>. The teller notified the owner of the mobile home park where <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON> lives, and the park owner drove <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> bank. `` I wanted my money. I worked for about 25 years to make it,'' <PERSON> Kinslow </PERSON> said. What are his plans for the windfall? `` Put it in another bank,'' he said.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began working today on rules for its votes on two articles of impeachment to oust Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, and one lawmaker said he would try to reinstate a third charge that was dismissed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, acting as judge and jury in the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s trial, met briefly and adjourned into separate party caucuses to discuss how the vote should be taken. It was expected to reconvene this afternoon. Republican Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, who voted against the motion Wednesday to dismiss a charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan, said some senators had second thoughts. <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said his proposal would still allow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to vote next week on the first two charges, on which testimony already has been heard. The third charge would be heard if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was acquitted on the other two. Wednesday's vote came as a surprise to many senators and set the stage for a vote as early as Monday on two other charges against the governor, who also faces a May 17 recall election and an April 21 criminal trial. The motion to dismiss the third charge was approved on a 16-12 vote. However two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators who opposed the dismissal were ill Wednesday but attended today's session. Thus, lawmakers said they would have to change two other senators' minds to get the 16 votes to reconsider. One of the two who were absent Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, said he believed it was a `` serious error'' to dismiss the third charge. Meanwhile, lawmakers were considering whether to vote on each of the two impeachment articles as a whole or take separate votes on all 11 subsections of the two articles. `` I've been accepting the body blows for about 15 months now ... and the ribs are a little bit bruised,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, an auto dealer and perennial political outsider, told a group of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> supporters Wednesday. But he said he still had plans for `` when I get back there'' in the governor's office. The vote to dismiss the third charge Wednesday was a surprise to most involved, including the senator who made the motion, Republican <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON>. Several of those who voted to dismiss said they wanted to avoid prejudicing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s upcoming criminal trial on felony charges that he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. That would have been the subject of evidence on the third impeachment charge and <PERSON> Stump </PERSON> said it would have put the governor in `` quasi-double jeopardy.'' The decision set the stage for a vote as early as Monday on two other charges against the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, who also faces a May 17 recall election and an April 21 criminal trial. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> remains accused of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official Those voting for the dismissal motion were an unusual coalition of all 11 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats plus five Republicans who have steadfastly supported the governor. Lawmakers refused to predict whether there will be the two-thirds majority of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> needed to convict on the remaining two charges.. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> disputed speculation that Democrats voted for the dismissal motion because they think they have the votes to boot <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` I think this needs to be brought to a conclusion,'' he said of the 5-week-old impeachment trial, `` and this is my view of one way to bring it to a conclusion.'' `` I've always been confident,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday night. He refused to comment directly on the dismissal. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he considered it a victory. If <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is convicted, Secretary of State <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who has been acting governor since <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s Feb. 5 impeachment by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would become governor. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to receive jury instructions this afternoon. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday morning, and a vote can be taken any time afterward. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has repeatedly insisted he is innocent of all wrongdoing and that he is the victim of persecution by the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> establishment and the media. He has been surrounded by controversy since he took office in January 1987. The day after taking office, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> canceled a Martin Luther King holiday for state workers on grounds it was illegally created by his predecessor, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. He also has made comments that angered blacks, homosexuals, women, Jews and Japanese. The governor said Wednesday night that if he is returned to office he would be willing to declare that `` bygones can be bygones'' in his relations with the Legislature.

 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said Thursday he resigned as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador to protest Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meeting with two Arab-Americans linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said the meeting Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> endangered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security and `` raises a larger question of the value of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> commitments to us when we have made huge concessions to obtain these guarantees.'' `` I could not speak freely -LRB- about this -RRB- as long as I was ambassador. So I had to make a choice,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The surprise resignation of the articulate, U.S.-educated <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> _ a rising star in Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc _ was the strongest signal yet of Israeli displeasure over the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> meeting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in remarks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, said it was unreasonable to suggest he could not meet American citizens. But <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON> violated a 1975 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge not to meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members. The two are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said their membership on the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> does n't make them <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. In addition, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appeared to be clearing the way for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks and `` a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> state right in the heart of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, threatening our very security, our very future.'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, who had served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador since 1984, said he was planning to resign in several weeks anyway to begin campaigning for a seat as a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator in November's elections. `` I decided to resign early because of the critical developments,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> activists hope the 39-year-old <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> will give an electoral boost to the entire party, which narrowly missed winning a majority in 1984 parliamentary elections. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has suggested <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Natan </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as a possible replacement for <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, considered a close friend of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said he still had `` warm personal regard'' for the secretary of state but that his meeting with <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON> had created `` a deep rift'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Even friends can sometimes take steps which are unacceptable or dangerous,'' he said. He said the meeting heightened Israeli concern about a <LOCATION> U.S.-Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan, which calls for an international conference leading to direct peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab enemies. `` I will pound the pavement from city to city in order to explain to the public the dangers of an international conference,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and fellow <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> mambers have staunchly opposed an international forum, warning that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be outnumbered by its enemies and forced to make territorial concessions. `` The very clear possibility exists now that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will sit across the table from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in this conference and will be the party we will be demanded to give land to,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Sunday in his second shuttle to campaign for the peace plan, and he is likely to hear plenty of complaints there about the meeting with <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called the meeting `` a slap in the face'' and told party members `` It was possible to see on television how much they -LRB- Said and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON> -RRB- hate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, the son of a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, has lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> most of his life. He attended high school in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and studied business administration at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, became a national hero as the senior commander during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1976 rescue of hostages in <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. He was the only Israeli officer killed in the operation.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Thursday re-enacted <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s last supper with his apostles by washing the feet of 12 priests in a solemn Holy Thursday ritual. Some 3,000 worshipers gathered for the two-hour ceremony in the vast, marble-columned <ORGANIZATION> Basilica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lateran </ORGANIZATION> with its 16 rooftop figures of Christ, the apostles and saints silhouetted against the early evening sky. The 17th century basilica, built on an ancient Roman property, is the pope's church as bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Earlier Thursday, the pontiff celebrated Mass at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica in <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, leading <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clergymen _ including 22 cardinals, 30 bishops and some 1,000 priests _ in renewing their vows of celibacy During the evening ceremony, the 67-year-old pope, draped in white vestments, washed the feet of the dozen mostly elderly priests in a service symbolizing <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' humility before he was crucified on Good Friday. Wearing a protective apron, the pontiff poured water from a golden urn onto one foot of each priest, wiping it with a white cloth before bending down to kiss it. The priests, dressed in white, red and gold, were seated on a platform under the austere, gold-leaf nave of the basilica, which is said to contain the heads of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and where until a century ago popes were crowned. The service included hymns and chants by the <ORGANIZATION> Sistine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>, as well as a homily in Italian by the pope on the theme of Christian humility. The two rites Thursday began four days of ceremonies that culminate on Easter Sunday, celebrating the passion, death and resurrection of Christ. On Friday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is to carry a wooden cross in the traditional Good Friday ceremony starting from the torch-lit Colosseum. He will celebrate the Easter vigil on Saturday night, and a Sunday Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square.

 The government Thursday unveiled the long-awaited laws that release businesses from the shackles of state plans and promise factory managers and foreign joint ventures substantial autonomy in making decisions. The two proposed laws and a draft constitutional amendment legitimizing the private sector were submitted to the 2,970 delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature. The delegates are expected to discuss the measures in small groups over the next week and approve them April 13, the last day of the congress' 20-day session. Rather than break new ground, the proposed laws would formalize changes already under way in the economy and clear up confusion over the new practices. The proposed measure on joint ventures would provide a legal framework for foreigners doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposed law on state-owned enterprises was essential to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization `` Whether or not -LRB- state-owned -RRB- enterprises can have great vitality will have a great influence on the overall development of our national economy,'' he told the delegates, gathered in the huge Great Hall of the People. `` Therefore ... we must separate government and industry and guarantee the autonomy of enterprise management,'' <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> said. The government hopes autonomy will turn <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s often debt-ridden, inefficient state stores and factories into lean, competitive production machines. They will be free to respond to changes in market demand and also will be free to go bankrupt if they make bad decisions. It is no coincidence that the government plans to implement a bankruptcy law later this year. More than 70 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 90,000 state-run enterprises already have signed contracts with the government giving their managers some degree of adminstrative autonomy. The new law is intended to erase lingering ambiguities over the roles of managers, local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials, local government and unions. Similarly, the proposed law on Chinese-foreign joint ventures and the constitutional amendment allowing private enterprise serve to codify changes that have already been introduced. Although the draft state enterprise law probably is the most widely discussed in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> history, having been submitted to special seminars nationwide, Thursday was the first time its actual wording was released to the general public. `` An enterpise shall, in accordance with law, make its own managerial decisions -LRB- and -RRB- take full responsibility for its own profits and losses,'' reads one of the 68 articles. Enterprises also will be allowed to sell their products on their own after meeting state quotas, chose their own suppliers, set their prices and enter into contracts with foreign parties. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> first suggested such a law in 1978, when he began his campaign to reduce central planning and revitalize the economy through monetary incentives. Versions have been discussed by four previous legislative sessions, generating debate unprecedented in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largely rubber-stamp congress. Official media reports indicate the congress' standing <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made revisions almost up to the last minute. One major criticism was that workers could be victimized by autocratic managers. Late additions included several clauses that promise wide powers to workers, thus substantially eroding business managers' promised new autonomy. `` An enterprise shall ensure that its staff and workers enjoy the status of masters. ... -LRB- and -RRB- shall practice democratic management,'' the bill reads. It adds that workers' congresses must approve wage adjustments and bonus distribution plans, and have the right to supervise and call for the removal of top company officials. The draft law on joint ventures would help standardize the form of contractural joint ventures and promote their growth, <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuobin </PERSON>, foreign trade minister, told the congress. The bill states that the joint venture `` should not be interfered with'' in making managerial decisions, and allows either the Chinese or foreign partner to chair the board. Chinese companies already have formed more than 5,000 joint ventures with foreign companies, with a total foreign investment of about $ 3.38 billion. However, many foreign businesses have complained about the lack of a legal framework for their joint venture agreements. The proposed constitutional amendment declares the private sector to be `` a complement to the socialist public economy'' that is allowed to exist within legal limits. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> currently has more than 18 million private-sector enterprises, most employing only one or two people. A companion amendment declares that rights to use land may be transferred. All land in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is considered owned by the whole people, but in the past year several cities have sold land-use rights for up to 50 years.

 Four legislative leaders on Thursday said annual sessions were `` an experiment that did n't work'' and called for a return to sessions every other year. `` We have seen legislative expenses rise and we have seen good lawmakers make the hard choice not to run again because they can not be in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> every year and at the same time make a living for themselves and their families,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scamman </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Scamman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> support a proposed constitutional amendment that would put the change before voters in November. `` They -LRB- voters -RRB- should have the chance to judge the efficiency of annual sessions based on the experience of the last four years and to register their opinion with their vote,'' <PERSON> Scamman </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statuatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 12-4 to recommend legislation that would put the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said today it had cracked a major heroin-importing ring involving trafficking through <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and was arresting 233 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told a news conference it was the largest international drug case ever developed by the federal government and said it has been a `` stunning success.'' The arrests were the result of a lengthy criminal investigation in cooperation with Italian authorities, and involved the import of southwest Asian heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 69 defendants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> include 38 charged in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, six in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 10 in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, eight in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and five in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, authorities intend to charge 164 people, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Authorities seized six kilograms of heroin and four kilograms of cocaine during the course of the investigation. Italian authorities seized 22 kilograms of heroin last month. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the purpose of the investigation has been to penetrate organized drug operations and not just to make random drug seizures. `` The tentacles of this network spread out across this country,'' he said. The attorney general declined to speculate on what impact the arrests will have on drug traffic in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Nobody knows for sure the quantity of heroin or any other drug coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of penetration `` is going to the heart of drug trafficing networks rather than just cutting off the tentacles.'' During the news conference to announce the drug arrests, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> refused to answer reporters' questions on the resignation of two of his top aides amid increasing skepticism on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> over whether he can continue to run the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is the target of a broadening criminal investigation, turned aside at least half a dozen questions relating to the possibility that he might quit in the wake of Tuesday's resignations of Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> `` The business of law enforcement is going forward energetically and without interruption,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` Our strong management team is on the job.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who has called for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation, said, `` I think he has lost his credibility It's a joke when he's talking about drug enforcement when everyone wants to know why he's still attorney general.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>, chief of the narcotics section of the criminal investigations division of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said authorities also have seized business assets in connection with the arrests. Suspects arrested today have been charged with conspiracies to import, possess and distribute drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Authorities used physical and electronic surveillance during the investigation. Authorities were alerted to the presence of a Sicilian Mafia drug network operating out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and trafficking in heroin by a 1985 drug case involving a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pizza restaurant, authorities said. A government affidavit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said two of the defendants in the current case operate pizza restaurants in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and another is a former pizza restaurant owner there. Two of the defendants in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and one of those charged in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> are fugitives from Italian drug convictions, The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The Sicilian Mafia's drug trafficking plan involved exporting cocaine from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where it would be exchanged for heroin and then smuggled back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the difference in the price of cocaine here and in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> made the scheme profitable for the network. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> commended the cooperation of the Italian government and law enforcement agencies in coordinating the investigation and arrests. Sessions said Italian law enforcement officials have made 68 arrests so far and are pursuing fugitives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. `` The Sicilian Mafia that today's actions are directed against is one of the primary groups responsible for the importation of southwest Asian heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said the three other primary groups bringing drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are Mexicans, Colombians and Asians.

 Government prosecutors said Thursday they would investigate allegations that former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'s brother diverted millions of dollars in government money to real estate investments overseas. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON> was arrested early Thursday on charges he embezzled $ 10.4 million while head of the semi-official Saemaul Undong -LRB- New Community -RRB- development organization. He also was charged with taking bribes, influence peddling, evading taxes and violating business, land and construction laws. If convicted, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, 46, could receive a sentence ranging from 10 years in prison to death. `` Our investigation will continue to check other charges that he diverted a huge amount of money for land speculation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' senior prosecutor <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-il </PERSON> told reporters. Eight other people, including aides of the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and other senior <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION> officials, also were arrested on embezzlement, bribery and other charges, officials said. They included the former president's two brothers-in-law. `` It is agonizing to me that I have caused trouble to my brother,'' prosecutors quoted the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as saying. According to the arrest warrant, the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> amassed a fortune in cash, land and stocks by using government and family connections. He was named head of <PERSON> Saemaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Undong </PERSON> in 1981, the year after his brother seized power with military backing, and resigned the post in 1987 after reports linked him to criminals. Meanwhile, opposition parties charged Thursday that the government was covering up massive corruption in the scandal, and demanded the former president be questioned in the probe. `` The government has orchestrated another cover-up and fooled the people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The party, one of two main opposition groups, demanded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be questioned about charges of widespread corruption during his seven-year rule, which ended Feb. 24. Authorities have questioned some 200 politicians and business leaders about corruption or trying to cover it up to protect former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family, but none has been formally implicated. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said Thursday he did not plan to expand the investigation to uncover other crimes under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> because most such cases were closed through trials. Many observers here believe the probe of <LOCATION> Saemaul </LOCATION>, which oversees rural and urban development projects, is part of efforts by President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> to distance himself from his authoritarian predecessor. In his presidential campaign pledge in December, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said he would investigate all irregularities under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. The former president has not been implicated in the scandal. Government officials said Thursday that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> will register his assets with government agencies to show his determination to establish a clean government. The officials said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has urged the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to carry out administrative reforms, including the property registration of high-ranking government officials.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Changes And Strengthens As Disease Progesses,
Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The virus that causes AIDS actually changes and grows more powerful as the immune deficiency disease progresses, according to studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In a report to be published Friday, Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION>, said he and a group of researchers discovered the changing virus by studying blood samples taken over a four-year period from four men who were infected by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The scientists found that as the AIDS patients became sicker, the virus seemed to evolve and strengthen. `` It's surprising,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The virus does n't just stay the same, but actually changes its biologic features. It looks like the same virus, but it's probably evolving within the individual.'' The studies started while all four of the randomly selected subjects tested positive for the HIV virus, but had not yet developed AIDS. Three of the men later developed AIDS and two died. The fourth continues to have no AIDS symptoms, even though he tests positive for the virus. In the three who developed AIDS, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the HIV viruses isolated from their blood samples became more and more virulent as their symptoms intensified. Virulence was tested by exposing the isolated virus to cells in test tubes. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said that when the subjects were experiencing the most severe AIDS symptoms, the HIV from their blood was able to multiply more readily. It also could more easily infect cells and would attack a greater variety of cells. Viruses isolated periodically from the patient who remained without AIDS symptoms, however, did not show any change in virulence, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said it is obvious that the virus must be able to reproduce, or replicate, in order to evolve this increasing virulence. As a result, he said, if researchers can stop the virus from replicating, then it could be kept harmless, even though it continued to live within the patient. `` You would n't get rid of the virus ... They are kept for the lifetime of the individual,'' said <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. `` They would just never become strong enough to cause disease.'' The <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION> researchers now are searching for the HIV genes responsible for increasing its virulence and its ability to replicate. If this gene can be isolated, said <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, `` then we can actually target some approach -LRB- such as a drug -RRB- of getting at the virus and arresting its replication.'' Working with <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> in the research were <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-Mayer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Seto </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Masatoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tateno </PERSON>. A report on the study was published Friday in Science, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks and destroys lymphocytes, a key cell in the body's defenses against disease. Without this defense, patients develop infections or rare cancers that usually prove fatal. The HIV virus causes AIDS. Patients can test positive for the presence of the HIV virus, but not have the symptoms of AIDS. Scientists continue to be puzzled why the virus often remains dormant for months, and even years in some cases, before patients develop the AIDS-related symptoms. The HIV virus is spread through sexual contact or through the exchange of blody fluids. It is most common among homosexual and bisexual men, and among drug users who have shared injection needles. Since 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> report a total of 57,575 AIDS cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of these, 32,190 have died. Nobody is known to have been cured of AIDS. Other developements in AIDS research include: _ Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> report they have found that a protein essential for the replication of the HIV virus has a novel chemistry that may suggest a new approach to an AIDS drug <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> said he and his collegues have discovered that molecules of an HIV protein called Tat are bound together by metal atoms. He said there are other protein molecules that also use metal atoms, but the structure in Tat is unique. This, he said, opens the possibility of attacking the HIV virus by somehow blocking the binding of the metal atoms. The research, which also is reported in Science, was conducted at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> by <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pabo </PERSON>.

 The Teamsters union and the trucking industry reached a tentative agreement today on a national freight contract covering some 200,000 drivers and warehouse workers. The three-year National Master Freight Agreement would replace a contract of similar length with the industry's collective bargaining arm, <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, that was scheduled to expire at midnight. Terms of the accord, which still must be ratified by rank-and-file union members, were not disclosed immediately. But Teamsters President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said it `` addresses the economic need of our members and advances their legitimate claims for job security.'' Going into the talks, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> officials were under pressure to end a pattern of concessionary bargaining since the industry was deregulated in 1980 and win wage and benefit gains in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent over their current base pay of $ 14.71 an hour for drivers. While some large carriers are enjoying fairly healthy profits now despite freight rate-cutting wars among them, several smaller companies are having financial troubles. Teamster employees of the smaller firms had indicated they were more interest in job protection than large wage gains. Since deregulation of trucking in the last year of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, at least 78 Teamster-organized carriers have gone out of business or been swallowed up in mergers. The union has lost about 120,000 members in the industry since 1979, although it has stablized in recent years. `` Negotiations were difficult because the industry is in such financial chaos,'' <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said, encouraging his union's members to ratify the accord. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' constitution, it takes a two-thirds membership vote to reject a contract approved by the union's leaders. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>, a spokesman for the union, said both sides had agreed not to discuss details of the tentative contract until after it had been submitted for a ratification vote.

<HEAD>Bold New Consumer's Guide Rates School Districts On Scale Of 0-100</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A first-of-its-kind guidebook rating some 500 metropolitan school districts offers families relocating to a new area a way to begin answering the question: Where are the good schools? The answers in `` Public Schools <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION>, $ 17.95 -RRB- a 366-page book by 25-year veteran education writer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, are n't surprising: Larger urban districts like <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> generally rate low, and wealthier suburban districts, especially in the Northeast, score high. But what is surprising is the book's daring `` Effective Schools Index,'' which rates all 500 or so districts on a scale of 0-100. The highest score by any district was <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, an affluent <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> suburb cited for an excellent program for gifted students, with a near-perfect 98. At the opposite end, <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, scored 13. The book noted high levels of classroom disruption, vandalism, lack of funds and `` fair to poor'' building maintenance. Still, the book to be published late April is meant as a consumer guide, not a scientific study or survey. Its introduction stresses: `` We have not tried to pick the so-called ` best districts' in an area.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who spent a year and about $ 10,000 of his money researching the book, profiled each district using 22 statistics gathered in mailed questionnaires filled out by the districts themselves. Using 10 of those 22 statistics, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> devised his `` effective schools index.'' The median score nationwide was 58. School districts earned from zero to 10 points on each of 10 criteria: average daily attendance, spending per pupil, dropout rate, average combined SAT or ACT scores, percentage of eligible students taking the SAT or ACT, number of Advanced Placement courses, teacher-student ratios in elementary and secondary grades, counselor-student ratio, and number of students per music specialist. Districts that did n't provide a statistic or misinterpreted a question received a zero. Twenty of the 26 districts that scored 85 or higher were in the Northeast. A dozen were in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area, and seven of those were in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> counties on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Outside the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Elmhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, scored 91; <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 86; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Euclid-Lyndhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 86; <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 93; <ORGANIZATION> Westside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, 89, and <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, 88. But quite a number of districts did not respond to <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s mailed requests and therefore received no rating, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> And the guide covered only districts with at least 2,500 students located within 25 miles of 52 core cities _ meaning thousands of districts were excluded because of size or location. The book also evaluated `` quality of school leadership,'' `` quality of instruction,'' and `` quality of school environment,'' drawing on the expertise of about 1,000 local education reporters, parent groups and others. Those write-ups offer consumers a way to look beyond the statistics. `` Statistically, cities seem to look bad,'' said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> in an interview. `` But our profiles point out that there are conclaves of excellence, magnet schools of high quality, good principals and good teachers. We did n't want to write the cities off.'' <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, for example, scored a below-average 30 on the book's effectiveness index But the district's profile praised its gifted programs, and added building maintenance is good, `` especially for a district of this size.'' On the other hand, <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, rates a strong 70, but its write-up warns readers to `` take note of the low score on the state competency test in math.'' While the numerical rankings are sure to attract the most attention, they can be misleading taken alone. For example, <LOCATION> Ridgewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> scored 86, earning perfect 10s in many of the index's 10 statistical categories. But it received only 3 out of 10 points for spending $ 5,034 per pupil, well below the $ 5,544 average for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s index penalizes <LOCATION> Ridgewood </LOCATION> for `` underspending,'' <LOCATION> Ridgewood </LOCATION>'s taxpayers may, in fact, be getting better value for their education dollars than, say, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which scored a comparable 88 but was awarded the full 10 points for spending $ 11,500 per pupil. `` Some persons might argue that our information does not provide a complete picture of a district,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> wrote. `` Frankly, we have never heard two educators agree on what data would constitute a complete picture. `` What we have done,'' he said, `` is to enable every American to fairly evaluate hundreds of school districts ... using a great many yardsticks that educators themselves, government statisticians, and scientific researchers consider important and valid.''

 Men like to see women's legs. So what else is new? What's new, according to a poll published Thursday, seems to be that while 36 percent of men say they favor miniskirts on women, and 71 percent say they like skirts at the knee or above, follow-up interviews indicate men generally concede that women have to consider whether showing too much leg is a wise career choice. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he likes short skirts because they're `` attractive'' and `` sexy.'' But, the 25-year-old engineer said, `` if you're in a meeting and everyone's dressed conservatively, there's less distraction.'' In The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times-CBS telephone poll of 1,654 adults, a quarter of the women questioned said they had worn a skirt above their knees in the past year, while 46 percent of the women said they prefer a length below the knee. The poll was conducted between March 19 and 22. The tepid response of women to the new short styles had already been made apparent at the cash registers to those in the fashion trade, prompting designers to show some longer skirts in their fall collections.

<HEAD>Toshiba Import Ban Gets Approval from Trade Bill Panel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators agreed Thursday to attach to their sweeping trade bill tough sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and a subsidiary for selling submarine silencing equipment to the Soviets. House members relented and agreed to the measure despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration warnings that a similar provision was too inflexible and could bring on a presidential veto. Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, urged lawmakers to ignore the warnings, declaring that he was embarrassed by the Republican administration's reluctance to discipline <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been kicked in the shins and instead of yelling ` Ouch,' they have chosen to surrender,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said. The complex measure would ban <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> goods for three years. It would ban all sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of products from its <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. There would be no waivers, but exceptions could be made for national security. The measure calls for two - to five-year import bans to punish any companies that in the future might send militarily useful equipment to communist countries in defiance of <ORGANIZATION> Cocom </ORGANIZATION>, an agreement among Western nations that is designed to control the flow of such goods Retroactive sanctions contained in the measure also would apply to <PERSON> Kongsberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vapenfabrikk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Like <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>, that company allegedly was involved in the sale of computerized milling equipment that the administration says has been used to produce submarine propellors that are hard for detection equipment to hear. Cabinet members warned lawmakers earlier this week that stringent sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> could mean a veto of the 1,000-page trade bill that lawmakers are drawing up in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. House members had been holding out for allowing the president to make the decision on whether sanctions should be mandatory. But after three hours of debate, they relented and accepted a somewhat softened proposal by <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>. The full conference committee in theory could drop the provision or alter it, although that would be hard to arrange. There was considerable reluctance, but no outright dissent, as <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., accepted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, repeatedly urged the panel to trust the judgments of the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments as well as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> ban would amount to a mistake. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> retorted: `` I was elected as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator to represent the State of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and not <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> and not <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and not the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and not -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Tax Gap Expected Incease by One-Third To $114 Billion by 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inflation and economic growth over the next four years will boost by one-third _ to almost $ 114 billion _ the gap between federal income taxes owed and voluntarily paid, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. However, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> cautioned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against counting on that money as potential income to reduce the federal budget deficit. An undetermined portion of the `` tax gap'' represents taxes that would not be worth the effort to collect even if enforcement activities were stepped up. `` Our estimates of the income-tax gap are measures of total non-compliance,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are not intended to be measures of the potential for additional enforcement yields.'' Using information collected in 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimates the tax gap at $ 84.9 billion for 1987. That is down from $ 95 billion in 1986. The agency projects an $ 87 billion gap next year and $ 113.7 billion in 1992. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said the estimates for this year and the future are less than they would have been had not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made significant changes in the tax law in 1986. Those changes included cuts in tax rates, reduced itemized deductions and higher personal exemptions, which, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> believes, will reduce incentives for cheating. That increase in voluntary compliance among individuals will be offset by inflation and growth of the economy, <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. Although the new estimates still indicate a sizable tax gap, the commissioner said, they are considerably below what the agency had forecast in 1983. The 1983 projection was for a gap of $ 115 billion for 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said individuals accounted for $ 63.5 bilion of the 1987 gap and corporations were to blame for the remaining $ 21.4 billion. While the agency expects the voluntary compliance rate among individuals will increase slightly over the next few years, corporate compliance will decline, partly because the 1986 law shifted a significant part of the tax burden from individuals to corporations. Individuals' underreporting of income was to blame for $ 48.3 billion of the tax gap in 1987; overstated deductions, $ 6 billion; overstated credits, $ 900 million; math errors, $ 1 billion; and the failure of many people to even file a required return, $ 7.2 billion. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, cautioned against reading too much into the tax-gap figures, noting they are estimates based on small samples. He and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, agreed on a major point: The agency must be given enough money to provide a top level of service to taxpayers. Recalling several years of what he said were underfunding of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said, `` If you have to write a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to straighten out an account, you're going to learn the meaning of frustration.'' In hiring and retaining employees, he said, `` the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is not competitive with private industry.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> added: `` How can someone whose salary is so low as to be eligible for food stamps be expected to answer all the complex questions thrown at taxpayer assistance -LRB- employees -RRB- during the current -LRB- return -RRB- filing period?'' The telephone `` assistors'' who field taxpayers' telephoned questions are paid as little as $ 13,000 a year _ considerable less than many garbage collectors, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON>, an associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees other federal agencies for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> already is weighing several <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommendations for reducing the tax gap. These include a capacity for matching business information documents against business returns just as computers already match individual wage and income statements against returns; stepping up efforts to improve the reporting of taxable tips; and trying to find a bigger share of illegal income to tax.

<HEAD>Medicare Won't Raise Payments for New Anti-Clotting Drug TPA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials said Thursday they have decided against increasing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments to hospitals for treating heart attack victims with an expensive new anti-clotting drug called TPA. `` There is a question as to whether the circumstances involving TPA are so unique as to justify some special accommodation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have concluded that they are not.'' The hospitals have been pressing the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to take into account the high cost of TPA _ which runs about $ 2,000 a dose _ in paying for the treatment of heart attack victims. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays hospitals a flat, predetermined amount for treatment of various illnesses rather than reimbursing hospitals for itemized expenses _ such as particular drugs or procedures _ used on a particular patient. Those fees are adjusted annually to take into account rising costs and other factors and are predicated on the assumption that, while a hospital may lose money on one patient, it is just as likely to reap an excess profit on another patient with the same diagnosis. TPA costs about 10 times as much as other clot-dissolving drugs, such as streptokinase, which have been available longer and have been used on many more patients. Nonetheless, an <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> fact sheet issued in connection with the decision raises the possibility that use of TPA `` may even result in cost savings'' by reducing the length of time a heart attack patient would need to be hospitalized. `` It is too early to know what the exact outcome will be,'' the fact sheet said. It noted that if TPA use does prove to increase overall costs for treating heart attack patients, such a determination would be taken into account automatically in the annual hospital payment adjustments. Although TPA, short for tissue plasminogen activator, has been judged safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration for quickly dissolving blood clots in heart attack patients, the evidence is less clear on whether it is significantly more effective than streptokinase in saving lives. Trials making a direct comparison between the two drugs are about to begin in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, but results will not be known for a couple of years. Study results released at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION> this week showed TPA reduced the number of heart attack deaths by more than 50 percent, when compared to a placebo, in a study of 700 patients. A much larger trial, involving about 17,000 patients, showed a combination of streptokinase and aspirin reduced mortality by nearly 60 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> fact sheet also said some of the warnings carried on TPA labeling `` include factors likely to be more prevalent in the Medicare population than in the general population.'' `` For example, almost 50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries admitted for -LRB- heart attacks -RRB- in fiscal year 1986 were 75 years or older, an age cohort for which physicians are cautioned to weigh the expected benefits of TPA against the risks,'' it said.

 The Vietnamese government is prepared to make the single largest repatriation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> remains since the end of the Vietnam War, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` We are announcing that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will repatriate 27 remains to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government representatives on April 6, 1988 in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman. Once transferred in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the remains will be flown to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, for identification, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> added. `` This will be the largest number of remains repatriated at one time,'' the spokesman said. `` Previously, the largest turnover of remains was 26 on Aug. 14, 1985.'' There are currently 2,404 Americans still listed as missing in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,767 are listed as missing in either North or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Up to now, the remains of 152 Americans have been repatriated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and subsequently identified by the laboratory. On March 2, the Vietnamese turned over 17 remains to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Those remains have yet to be identified, however. The upcoming transfer would be the fourth since retired Army Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last August as a special presidential emissary, hoping to step up the process of accounting for missing Americans. `` We've continued to press the Vietnamese and we are getting some results,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said Thursday. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could explain the sudden increase in repatriations, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> replied: `` It's really not for us to do that. The Vietnamese are the ones who should be explaining to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and to the world what happened to the rest of the remains and where they are.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the Vietnamese government informed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during technical meetings in mid-March they were investigating 29 new reports of remains being found or information regarding servicemen uncovered. Then earlier this week, the Vietnamese disclosed they did have 27 remains to repatriate, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> added. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appreciates the initiative taken by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.

 High blood pressure patients given the drug metoprolol had a 48 percent lower death rate than patients given more commonly used drugs, researchers said Thursday. Metoprolol -LRB- pronounced muh-TAH-pro-lawl -RRB- is one of the heart drugs known as beta blockers. The researchers said this is the first study to show that beta blockers can prevent more deaths in people with hypertension than can the widely used diuretics called thiazides. The American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 59 million Americans suffer from high blood pressure, or hypertension. `` We now have scientific proof that if we start with a beta blocker ... we will have a substantial reduction in deaths,'' said the study's principal author, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wikstrand </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Gothenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sahlgrenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Customary practice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been to prescribe diuretics first for high blood pressure and to try beta blockers later if the diuretics were n't working, said Dr. <PERSON> Stevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. New recommendations by a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> say that diuretics, beta blockers, or two newer classes of anti-hypertension drugs can serve as the first-line treatment for high blood pressure, said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON>, an advisor to that committee. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON>, who was not part of the study, joined <ORGANIZATION> Wikstrand </ORGANIZATION> at a press conference at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Plaza Hotel to discuss the study's findings The press conference was sponsored by metoprolol's developer, the <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> pharmaceutical company of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and by <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>, which holds the license to market the drug in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The results of the study will appear Friday in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Two earlier studies that compared beta blockers and diuretics failed to find any significant difference in the death rate, said Dr. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Furberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bowman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furberg </PERSON>, who recently wrote a medical journal article reviewing anti-hypertension drugs, called the new study interesting. But, he said in a telephone interview, `` I'm not sure how it's going to be accepted. It's possible we need to test it in a separate study.'' Wikstrand and colleagues at 66 centers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> monitored 3,234 men given either metoprolol or diuretics for a median period of 4.2 years. The researchers found a 48 percent lower death rate among men given metoprolol than those given diuretics. The drop was mostly due to a reduction in deaths from stroke and coronary heart disease, two complications of high blood pressure, the researchers said. There was no significant effect on other causes of death, suggesting that the drugs are safe, they said. The thiazides make up one class of diuretics, which relieve high blood pressure by stimulating the body to expel fluid, thus lowering the total volume of blood in the bloodstream. Beta blockers block the stimulating action of adrenaline, reducing the rate and the force at which the heart pumps blood through the body _ and reducing high blood pressure.

 A 23-year-old Wall Street `` whiz kid'' pleaded guilty to mail and securities fraud charges Thursday, admitting he bilked $ 10 million from scores of investors and spent the money on himself and friends. `` I obtained money from investors, and told them I would invest their money in securities. ... Instead I spent the money on art, automobiles, two homes and furnishings,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, a 1986 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, faces five years in prison and a maximum fine of double the amount lost by investors on each count. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> set sentencing for May 12. No sentencing agreement accompanied his guilty plea. Several months before his scam was revealed, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> was profiled in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> Sunday magazine feature on new art collectors. According to court papers, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> _ who was not licensed as an investment adviser _ used his clients' money to buy $ 5.5 million in art work, a $ 1.9 million East Hampton beach house, an $ 830,000 <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment, $ 800,000 in furnishings for the two homes, and two cars worth $ 200,000. The defendant also bought `` numerous items of expensive jewelry and deluxe trips to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'' for himself, relatives and friends, federal prosecutors charged. Investors were sent papers indicating their investments were turning a profit, sometimes prompting them to turn over more money, said prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotz </PERSON>. To lure additional investors, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> claimed to represent the <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family, the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, even though he did not. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> stood with his hands behind his back at Thursday's 25-minute hearing and politely answered <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>'s questions Asked if he realized his `` money management'' operation was illegal, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> responded in a firm voice: `` Yes, your honor.'' `` I said I was a money manager, but I did not invest their money as I told them I would,'' he told the judge. All the art will be auctioned at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s near the end of May, with the chance that some investors could still make a profit, said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. Bloom was arrested Jan. 14 on a federal complaint; he had 130 clients at his Greater Sutton Investors at the time of his arrest.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in an interview released Thursday that he would not be surprised if <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks fail, and he accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of blocking their success. The ruling Politburo discussed what action to take in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks in light of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` departure'' from willingness to participate in a political settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also carried an interview <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> gave to the Bulgarian newspaper <PERSON> Rabotnichesko </PERSON> <PERSON> Delo </PERSON> earlier this week, when the Soviet official was in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact meeting. `` Not everything depends solely on us and the Afghan government,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` This is why one can not but take into account the possibility that the talks may not lead to the accords expected of them. `` If this happens, we shall not see this outcome as unexpected,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said that if the U.N.-mediated talks fail, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will withdraw its 115,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` in a way convenient for the government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and ourselves.'' He did n't indicate whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would stick to the nine-month withdrawal timetable already agreed to in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which represents the guerrillas in the talks, of putting up last-minute barriers with demands that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> aid to the Afghan government cease at the same time as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the insurgents. The demand is intended to give the guerrillas legitimacy `` as something more than a group engaging in armed struggle against a lawful government,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Politburo, holding a regular weekly meeting Thursday, reviewed <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s discussions March 21-23 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` Note was taken of the actual departure by the American side ... from its earlier stated readiness to take part in a political settlement of the situation around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on the basis of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. Variants of our further steps in this question were studied with due consideration for this,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency did not say how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had backtracked or what steps the Politburo was considering. Talks aimed at ending the 10-year-old war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> recessed for the Easter holidays. Negotiations were scheduled to resume Monday, but informal contacts were expected over the weekend. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, said he was ready to sign an agreement anytime and hoped for progress soon on the issue of aid to the warring sides. He rejected <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s comments that an agreement could be signed even if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not participate. The entire deal then would have to be renegotiated, the Pakistani diplomat said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in its Thursday edition, quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was considering an arrangement under which <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would sign the accord, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would have a separate understanding on aid to the guerrillas.

 The frequency of autopsies is declining in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, possibly making it harder for researchers to determine causes of death, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said. In 1985, autopsies were conducted in 14 percent of deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from 17 percent in 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday, citing data from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The decline `` may have adversely affected the accuracy of determining the underlying cause of death,'' researchers with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in their weekly report. During the five-year period, the frequency of autopsies performed varied widely among causes of death, from 12 percent of natural deaths to 97 percent of homicides. Autopsies in natural deaths dropped from 13 percent in 1980 to 10 percent in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. On the other hand, autopsies following unintentional injuries and poisonings rose from 46 percent to 51 percent, and autopsies in suicides rose from 48 percent to 52 percent. In 1985, 34 percent of autopsies performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> involved deaths from other than natural causes, compared to 30 percent in 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Directors of a new national award aimed at promoting the quality of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products said Thursday they have raised $ 2.2 million to finance the competition and will announce the first winners in November. The <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON> National Quality Award was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August and named after the late commerce secretary, who was killed last year in a horse riding accident. Officials said Thursday that a maximum of six awards will be given annually _ two each for large manufacturing companies, large service companies and smaller companies engaged in either manufacturing or service. `` Quality is a key weapon in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s arsenal in the international battle for markets,'' <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said in making the announcement. `` This award, which will be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Nobel Prize for quality, should help recognize the firms that are making a difference when it comes to quality.'' The competition will be supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with a private foundation created by the legislation to raise money for the contest each year Directors of the new foundation are: <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, chairman emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudiburg </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON>, brother of the late commerce secretary. They said $ 2.2 million of a total goal of $ 9.9 million already had been raised from American businesses. <PERSON> Hudiburg </PERSON> said the new award would indicate to the world that `` we're willing to invest whatever it takes to insure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commitment to excellence is recognized both at home and abroad.'' Officials said the winning companies would be picked on the baisis of such criteria as quality assurance programs, with the largest weight in the judging going to customer satisfaction. After a review of written applications, the contest judges will make on-site inspections to pick the winners. The prize will carry no monetary award but winners will be allowed to mention the award in advertising. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prize was modeled after the Deming prize, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been awarding since 1951 to recognize quality achievements by Japanese companies. The Japanese prize was named to honor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Deming </PERSON>, an American quality control export revered in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for his work with Japanese companies after World War II. Companies interested in finding out more about the contest can write: <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON> National Quality Award, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, 20899.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceuticals company signed an agreement with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government Thursday that officials say could lead to increased American drug sales in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and development of Chinese drugs for world markets. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said it was too early to tell what specific drugs might be involved in the research agreement. But both sides said it could involve a range of products, including possible future AIDS treatments developed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` This is a good beginning between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yonggang </PERSON>, a vice president of the Chinese administration who signed the <ORGANIZATION> Sino-Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking through a translator, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said it was the first such agreement with an American company. The agreement says <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> will have the right to license exclusively any products that result from research and development under the trust. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSchutter </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s international operations, said the company already sells seven products in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although sales have been less than $ 100,000 annually. He said the agreement includes $ 500,000 for drug development, with provisions for increased funding later. <PERSON> DeSchutter </PERSON> said the potential Chinese market for foreign drugs could be between $ 3 billion and $ 5 billion annually. Imports of drugs and medical devices last year reached about $ 300 million, Chinese officials said. They had no figures for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the market. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> acknowledged that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where herbal medicine makes up a large share of the market, still lags behind other countries in product quality and research. He said more than 1,800 factories manufacture drugs or medical devices in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ including 600 facilities producing 4,000 kinds of herbal medicines. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> doubled its production of pharmaceuticals between 1979 and 1987 and plans to put more emphasis on exports. Dr. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaxiang </PERSON>, deputy director of the Chinese pharmaceutical agency, said there are some `` interesting findings'' related to AIDS in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although the country has had only about a half dozen cases of the fatal disease, all involving tourists. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON>, talking to reporters after the signing ceremonies, said researchers have identified several Chinese traditional remedies that enhance the human immune system. AIDS, or acquiried immune deficiency syndrome, breaks down the body's resistance to other diseases. More than 31,000 Americans have died of AIDS. `` We may provide some help, but we do n't have a cure,'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said. He said AIDS research is not specifically mentioned in the agreement with <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, but it might be one area to discuss. <PERSON> DeSchutter </PERSON> said the company has been involved in AIDS research and the pact could lead to some cooperation in that area with the Chinese. `` We have not had a chance to talk that out, but it's possible our approaches could be synergistic,'' he said after the news conference. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, develops, manufactures and markets prescription pharmaceuticals worldwide. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 Passenger deaths during airline flights are extremely rare, but crews are not adequately prepared and medical equipment aboard airliners is insufficient to deal with the problem, researchers conclude. `` Airlines simply ca n't count on doctors being aboard flights,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>, one of five authors of a study published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` They should take a look at the duration of the flight, the number of passengers aboard and determine what additional measures are needed,'' added <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>, an associate professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. An average 72 passengers die during flights each year, which researchers called `` a vanishingly small rate'' of three deaths per 10 million passengers. The study reviewed deaths reported from 1977 to 1984 to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has 120 members and carries 50 percent to 60 percent of the world's scheduled international and domestic air traffic. Researchers concluded that 56 percent of the deaths appeared to be heart-related. Nearly two-thirds of the deaths during flight involved men, whose average age was 54. Doctors aboard the aircraft came forward to offer assistance in 43 percent of the deaths, the study found. Researchers concluded, however, that programs are needed to train flight attendants in the skills of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of automatic external defibrillators, the electric-shock `` heart starters,'' said <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>. `` They are not part of the on-board medical kits now, and we're not advocating they be added to every flight,'' he said `` But some flights should have them.'' `` If flight attendants can be trained to open airplane doors in an emergency, they can be trained to operate a defibrillator,'' he said. `` And the machine provides a simple way to diagnose many kinds of cardiac arrest. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade organization representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, said flight attendants on most major carriers already receive training in CPR skills. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> attendant <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> used CPR to save a stricken passenger for the second time in her career. A man collapsed just after boarding her plane in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and an unidentified doctor on board helped her until paramedics arrived at the airport. CPR proficiency is part of flight attendants' training, Ms. <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said, and `` you never forget it.'' <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> did not include defibrillators in its August 1986 guidelines on mandatory equipment for airline medical kits. Those guidelines are scheduled for review this summer. `` Basically, our policy has been to land as soon as possible, and in this country, that means no more than 20 or 30 minutes no matter where you are,'' said <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON>. `` Crews call ahead for medical teams at the runway and, once on the ground, we're certain that experienced, capable doctors are providing treatment,'' he added. `` And we just ca n't ask flight attendants to diagnose an ailment ... to know the difference between a heart attack and say, a diabetic one,'' said <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> countered that a delay of 20 minutes or longer could prove fatal in instances of sudden cardiac arrest. `` The law does n't obligate the airlines,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> said, `` but it's time they started taking responsibility in some of these emergencies.''

 The 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded Thursday to <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> for `` Beloved,'' a novel which was at the center of controversy when it did not win two other major literary prizes. The prize for drama went to `` Driving Miss Daisy,'' by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhry </PERSON>, which like `` Beloved'' deals with race relations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prize for general non-fiction went to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> for `` The Making of the Atomic Bomb.'' The prize for biography went to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> for `` Look Homeward: A Life of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>,'' about the American novelist. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> also won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1961 for `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> and the Coming of the Civil War.'' The prize in history went to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, for `` The Launching of Modern American Science 1846-1876.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, an award-winning poet associated with <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, won the poetry prize for `` Partial Accounts: New and Selected Poems.'' The prize for music was awarded to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolcom </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, for `` 12 New Etudes for Piano.'' The focus of attention this year was on the fiction prize, which was awarded against a backdrop of controversy and literary politics. After `` Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers and critics signed a statement deploring Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s lack of recognition. Because she had never won the National Book Award or the Pulitzer Prize, said the statement, published as an open letter in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, `` she has yet to receive the national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve.'' Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s `` Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book Critics Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are considered more prestigious. `` Beloved'' is the agonizing story of a former slave in post-Civil War <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> who struggles to cope with the brutal death of her daughter. Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> uses flashbacks, multiple points of view and a singularly vivid ghost to describe the emotional trauma of slavery from the perspective of <LOCATION> Sethe </LOCATION>, who kills her daughter rather than yield her to bondage. `` Driving Miss Daisy,'' the drama winner, tells the story of an irascible white woman and her black chauffeur. The play follows their relationship over a quarter-century, ending in 1973. The play opened off-Broadway in April 1987 at the Playwrights Horizons Studio Theater and later moved to a larger off-Broadway theater where it is still running. `` The Making of the Atomic Bomb,'' the winner for general non-fiction, won a National Book Award last fall in the same category. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, who spent five years researching and writing the book, said in a recent interview: `` The making of the bomb is a story on the scale of ` Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>.' I do n't see much of a difference between writing fiction and fact, except, of course, that fact has to be documented.''

 Republican Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> met today with embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to convey the `` deep concern'' expressed by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of resignations by two top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> senator, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, refused to comment further on the nature of the discussions with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is under investigation by an independent counsel. In a statement issued by his office, <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said, `` a numn <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have expressed deep concern about the problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I went today to talk to the attorney general to convey these concerns to him.'' The meeting with <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> was the reason <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was late fber of people oor a scheduled 12:30 p.m. EST news conference at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, where he refused to answer reporters' questions on the resignation of two of his top aides. The resignations came amid increasing skepticism on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> over whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> can continue to run the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. At the news conference, called to announce a major drug bust, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> briskly turned aside at least half a dozen questions relating to the possibility that he might quit in the wake ofeld's reported remarks require a presidential inquiry and decision. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>'s statement, said only, `` Thank you for his general views. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he had `` no reaction'' to the remarks attributed to <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. The presidential spokesman said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was at the White House today for a `` security meeting'' on an undisclosed subject. `` The president was involved in the meeting,'' he said, but `` there were no private discussions between the two either before or after the meeting and none are planned.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is the target of a broadening criminal investigation. Department sources have said the top officials quit because they felt <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems were `` poisoning'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., said flatly that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> also called for his resignation, calling him `` the crown jewel of the sleaze factor in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration history.'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, referred to a report in today's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that quoted sources familiar with Tuesday's meeting of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, at which <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> turned in their resignations. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> the attorney general's situation presented a close call but that if it were up to <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> he would present it to the grand jury for an indictment. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in a similar report, quoted sources as saying <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had previously commented that `` he would have to seriously consider indicting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' The newspaper said that <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, asked about that comment, would not respond on the record. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, asked about the quotes attributed to <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, said, `` Up until this moment, or perhaps yesterday, you had a situation where the independent counsel was looking ... but I think now is a different matter. The president has to talk to Mr. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, has to examine the facts and then has to make a presidential decision.'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> earlier questioned `` whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> can function'' with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in charge. `` You finally reach a place where there is a cloud of suspicion, a sufficient cloud of suspicion, that I think you owe it to the president to remove yourself,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told the Times that he had become concerned about the collective `` damage'' being done to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by having a man under investigation as its leader. The Times quoted a source as saying <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told his aides in announcing his resignation that, to him, `` it was a question of moral authority and the tarnishing of the department.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said today that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` duty'' is `` to bring about the resignation of Mr <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' `` The president owes a duty to the country that may be much higher than that which he owes to his personal friend,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said at the start of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on antitrust matters. The question, said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, is, `` if Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> does not shortly resign whether the public will be losing confidence in government as a whole.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, quoted <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> as saying in an interview that, when he and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> they were resigning, the attorney general `` thought we were joking. I told him it was so. He seemed a little taken jaback.'' For his part, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said `` there's no reason to resign'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated his support for his old friend, saying `` he's been a friend for over 20 years I have every confidence in him.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked Wednesday why <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> remained on the job when <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted him out. `` I do n't think any of that is true,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, said today that reports that the first lady was campaigning for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s removal were `` absolutely not true.'' `` She has n't talked to anyone and no one has talked to her about the issue,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is visiting before joining the president at their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch Friday for an easter vacation. Quitting with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in the department, and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, were four of their aides. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> predicted on Wednesday that Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, who had said he was reconsidering his future with the department, would not follow suit. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who met with Fried on Wednesday, said `` I have no doubt that Mr. <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> will remain a strong member of the management team.'' `` Business is operating as usual at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared. He said replacements were being sought for <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and that `` everything is going along well.''

 Presidents can be reluctant to fire their closest aides, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has shown great loyalty to top advisers in the past, is unlikely to oust his longtime friend, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, White House observers say. `` He's been a friend for over 20 years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday in response to questions about whether he would remove the attorney general, who faces mounting legal problems. `` I have every confidence in him.'' His statement recalled the time in the summer of 1984 when the president, arriving in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, was quizzed about whether he would oust <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, who faced a federal indictment. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared that he would n't give in to a `` lynch mob atmosphere.'' When <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> finally was indicted, he saved <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the decision by resigning immediately. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> later was found innocent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court of larceny and fraud charges involving a construction company he co-owned. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> so dislikes firing top aides that an embittered Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had to try at least twice to quit before the president finally accepted his resignation in June 1982. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't fire <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> after he made offensive remarks about blacks, women, Jews and the handicapped in 1983. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> offered to step aside. `` After watching <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and reading about him all these years, I've come to the conclusion that it is a matter of leadership style that dictates that he not fire people,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonatati </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s labor adviser early in the administration. `` He never gets on the side of firing people and he always defends people who are under attack.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said steadfastly that he thinks public officials ought to be presumed innocent until found guilty in court. He's even gone further than that with two major figures in the Iran-Contra affair, saying he believes former national security aides <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> are innocent of charges they conspired to defraud the government <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s close association with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> goes back to his days as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from 1967-75, when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was a valued counselor. During his first months in the presidency in 1981, writes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> biographer <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> valued <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s advice above all others, believing that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would see to it that conflicting points of view were presented to him without coloration. In quintessential <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> style, the president threw his arm around <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> when reporters tried to question him about the attorney general early last fall, just after the two had appeared in the White House press room to announce <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s selection for a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> vacancy But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not the only president who has shown great loyalty to his aides. A former high-ranking official in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, describing the difficulty that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had in ousting budget director <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, said `` it's always difficult for presidents to let go of people close to them, and that was true of <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, and it's certainly true of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' `` These are the toughest issues for presidents to face,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Presidents do sometimes swing the ax, however. President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> ousted top aide <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> got rid of close associate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> eased out Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>. `` It's a major problem for all presidents,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>. `` But few presidents have been as reluctant and as reticent as this president to ditch people who become political liabilities. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> thought it was important to be cleaner than a hound's tooth.'' <PERSON> Bonatati </PERSON> noted he lost his job at the White House despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s aversion to firing. He said that when <PERSON> Faith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittlesey </PERSON> arrived in early March 1983 to succeed <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Whittlesey </PERSON> fired him and several other presidential advisers with short notice. `` She pretty much cleaned house,'' <PERSON> Bonatati </PERSON> said.

The Observer and the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> led <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers to a total of six Pulitzers.

The Journal also won a Pulitzer in specialized reporting for <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanich </PERSON>'s series of reports on faulty testing by American medical laboratories. <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reporters _ <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Baquet </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipinski </PERSON> _ won the investigative reporting prize for what the board termed `` detailed reporting on the self-interest and waste that plague <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We're thrilled,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Soeteber </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant managing editor for metropolitan news. `` I think the team of reporters deserved this so much. It was their concept. It was their idea, and they brought it off beautifully. I'm so glad some of the leaders in our profession recognized it.'' Two Pulitzers were given for general news reporting. One went to the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> for an investigation of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate, which prompted remedial legislation. The second was awarded to the staff of the Lawrence -LRB- Mass. -RRB- Eagle-Tribune for an investigation that revealed flaws in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough system and led to reforms. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, won the national reporting prize for his series on a secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget used to sponsor defense research and an arms buildup.

<HEAD>Teachers Union Chief Calls for Experimental Schools Within Present
System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that small groups of teachers should be given the autonomy and funds to create experimental schools within regular public schools. AFT President <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said the current public school system is not working for as many as 80 percent of the students and `` we've got to do something totally different.'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> suggested that groups of six to 12 teachers be allowed to organize their own schools, provided they can win the approval of principals, fellow teachers, parents and education authorities. `` It is time once again to take a major step forward in trying to improve the schools of our nation,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, whose 665,000-member union represents teachers in some of the nation's largest cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> He said state-mandated reforms and more stringent standards imposed over the past five years have improved schools for students at the top, `` but unfortunately -LRB- reform -RRB- is bypassing about 80 percent of kids.'' `` We now need to seek ways that will enable any group of teachers ... and parents of children who want to do something different to opt for a different type of school,'' he said in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> address. The autonomous schools `` ought to get their per capita share of what the school spends,'' he said. Public schools spend roughly $ 4,000 per pupil on average. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said, `` There would have to be a guarantee that such a school would be left alone for five or 10 years provided that parents wanted to keep sending their kids there.'' They would be strictly voluntary for teachers and students. `` If there's anarchy, the customers will be gone in no time at all,'' he said. `` This is not pie in the sky.'' He said such a system would give teachers an alternative to trying to `` shove reform down the throats'' of unwilling colleagues. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said only a handful of districts now are trying to restructure public schools. He claimed his idea could open the door for thousands of experimental schools. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said he would want the teachers to include in their proposals ways for teachers to govern themselves, to give students alternatives to sitting in class for six hours listening to lectures and to spur cooperative learning. The students also should `` reflect the composition of the entire school'' and not just be drawn from the top or bottom, he said. Last week, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, proposed that state leaders and teacher unions designate at least one experimental school district in each of the 50 states.

<TEXT>
 Paint that has built up on White House walls since 1797 is being removed as part of a project designed to spruce up the presidential residence for its bicentennial in 1992. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the job will involve removing some 30 coats of paint and repairing some of the carved stonework on the sandstone walls. Work began this week. The work will be done on the exterior north walls and part of the south walls and will be the first time in nearly two centuries that these walls have been exposed. The walls will be kept bare until the spring of 1989 to allow the porous sandstone to dry so the paint will adhere to the walls better. Repainting is scheduled for next spring. The paint is being removed by brushing chemicals on the walls and then flushing them with a stream of water. The work is being done by <ORGANIZATION> Ramco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, under a $ 384,200 contract. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, master carver for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, will oversee repair of the stone carvings. The project is part of a long-range exterior restoration program to repair and replace deteriorated stonework, remove old paint, repoint and seal masonry joints and then repaint. The east wall was restored in 1980 and the north portico in 1984. The entire program is to be completed for the bicentennial of the laying of the cornerstone of the `` President's House'' in 1792. The White House has been the home and office of every president since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>.

 Democrats looking ahead to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s April 19 presidential primary are focusing on the mystery of a Cuomo endorsement and the status of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s ticklish relationship with the state's influential Jewish community. The questions are obvious: Will Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> endorse his fellow <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? Or will he stay on the sideline, fueling speculation that he wants the nomination for himself? Can <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> overcome the sour taste lingering from his 1984 campaign when he infuriated <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jews by privately referring to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown?'' `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> got 26 or 27 percent -LRB- of the vote -RRB- in'84 after the ` Hymietown' crack and with a <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> who had a very strong call on the black constituency,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` He'll do at least that this year and probably substantially better. If he does 10 points better, he'll be at 37 -LRB- percent -RRB-. You have four candidates in the race, that's a big number.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, perhaps the most prominent Democratic non-candidate, has said his endorsement means little, but even his chief political adviser, son <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, does n't buy that. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it has a particular importance,'' said the younger <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` It helps the candidate among those people who have n't made up their minds yet or who are soft in their support.'' The governor has said that within the next week or so he will either endorse someone or announce that he's sitting it out. In 1984, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> got behind <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> early, and with the governor's powerful political machine in charge, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> scored an important victory to blunt <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s insurgent campaign. At times, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor has appeared to lean toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but lately he has been saying nice things about <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and has been proclaiming that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could win in November at the head of the ticket or would be good as the vice presidential candidate. And <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could well win the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, an outcome that would seriously damage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief rival for front-runner status, and perhaps increase the likelihood of a deadlocked national convention. Polls have thus far have shown <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the lead and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> doing only slightly better than the 26 percent he won in 1984. Also on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ballot will be Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and an uncommitted slate of delegates sponsored by a group of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s elected county clerks who would like to see <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in the race They say the uncommitted delegates could be valuable to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> if there's any move to draft him at the party's national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> While <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said he does n't want a draft, he has refused to rule out accepting one. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, one of the state's most powerful Democrats, has said he's ready to lead a draft-Cuomo move at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention. Numbers make <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary important. As the second largest state in the nation, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 275-member delegation will be second in size only to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s with 336 delegates. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary results will determine the allocation of 255 of the delegates. For <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could mark a new beginning or the end of the road. `` I have to have a result in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary that convinces you that this campaign has gained a significant momentum,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told a group of prominent New Yorkers early this week. In an attempt to carry that off, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has hired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> political consultant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, agreed to pump more than $ 1 million into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and adopted a new campaign strategy of attacking <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In a speech to Jewish leaders, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> contrasted his support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Democratic primaries, Jews traditionally represent about 25 percent of the electorate with blacks at about the same level. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is expected to capture the lion's share of the black vote, anything more than a single-digit showing for him among Jewish voters would be considered something of a miracle. Nonetheless, a recent poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> found that among Jewish Democrats surveyed, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s favorable rating has jumped to 36 percent from 17 percent in January. But less than 4 percent of those Jewish Democrats surveyed in the most recent poll said they would vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A Gallup poll, conducted at the end of last week, had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading at 44 percent to 28 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was at 3 percent and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 2 percent.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired three missiles into Iranian cities Thursday, then said it would stop for three days. No further attacks by either side were reported in the month-old round of the `` war of the cities.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the cease-fire would begin Thursday midnight -LRB- 4 p.m. EST -RRB- and last through the three days of a visit to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, prime minister of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. As the announced time passed, neither side had reported any attacks on each other's cities for hours. A Cypriot supertanker set afire by an Iranian warship earlier Thursday meanwhile ran aground in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, the Turkish capital, <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagri </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s missile launchings would `` automatically come to an end'' if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stopped attacking Iranian cities with rockets and bombs. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio did not confirm <PERSON> Bagri </PERSON>'s statement, but said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was the `` instigator'' of attacks on cities and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took `` retaliatory measures.'' Hundreds of civilians have been killed since the missile duel began Feb. 29 and thousands have died in raids on cities since the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980. An Iranian warship pounded the 232,164-ton supertanker Haven, loaded with 1.5 million barrels of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> crude, for 90 minutes at dawn Thursday. The 45-member crew was rescued from the burning ship, which ran aground later off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. Shipping executives believed the attack was a response to several Iraqi attacks in recent days on tankers owned or chartered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. About 500 ships have been attacked by both sides. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said two portable anti-aircraft missiles, tentatively identified as Soviet-made SAM-7s, were found on a drifting Iranian speedboat the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recovered last week. The Iranians use speedboats for attacks on neutral shipping. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch, exhorted his people to new effort in the long conflict, declaring: `` Today is the day of war. Today we must rush to the war front in order to inflict punishing blows on the enemy, and with the help of God we will succeed.'' `` The enemy has proved his brutal actions by firing chemical weapons on residential areas,'' he said in remarks reported by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. A dispatch from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a team of <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> physicians arrived to visit victims of alleged Iraqi chemical weapons attacks on border towns. It also said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped chemical bombs on <LOCATION> Marivan </LOCATION>, a Kurdish town about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, killing `` a number'' of civilians. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped gas bombs on <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> and two nearby Kurdish towns in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> two weeks ago, after Iranian troops captured them. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 5,000 people were killed in the attack and 5,000 wounded. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired two surface-to-surface missiles Thursday into <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, which was <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION>'s capital in the 17th century, and one into <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, seat of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious hierarchy. Since the missile exchange began, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has reported launching 105 missiles at <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> cities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it has fired 45 missiles at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and dozens into other <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities. Turkish Embassy officials in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> would arrive Friday afternoon accompanied by senior officials. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> maintains good relations with both <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and has tried to act as mediaor. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government spokesman was quoted by the official news agency as saying attacks on Iranian cities would not resume `` until six hours after the Turkish prime minister's departure'' on Sunday. The Cypriot tanker was attacked near the narrow <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, through which all ships must pass to enter or leave the gulf. Shipping executives said it drifted for more than three hours before running aground. Crew members huddled on the stern, unable because of the fire to reach the engine room and stop the engines, and they were rescued a few at a time. Tugboats brought the blaze under control later, said the informants, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the SAM-7s were found along with other weapons in an abandoned Iranian speedboat picked up in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> a week ago. He said a twin-barreled gun mounted in the cockpit of the 30-foot boat was a Soviet-made ZSU 23mm anti-aircraft weapon. SAM-7 missiles, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is known to possess, are shoulder-fired weapons similar to the U.S.-made Redeye.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Thursday he will not call up the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty for debate until the question of whether the pact bans futuristic weapons is better resolved. But Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has put `` 400 lawyers to work'' on the issue and added: `` I think it can be resolved. Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, however, that the general question of futuristic weapons is a serious one and must be addressed sooner or later <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports show the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has 10,000 scientists working on the development of futuristic weapons using lasers and directed energy. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> said the information came from a classified intelligence briefing, but that he had been given permission to release it. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters that the question of futuristic weapons had been addressed inadequately by the administration and it was not clear that they are banned by the treaty's restrictions. `` It is too important to risk going ahead,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` It is better to be sure, to be cautious and to be right. I intend not to call it up until it is better resolved than it is now.'' `` The treaty has to be good for us,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, adding that his decision to delay action on the treaty is `` a signal to the administration not to do in haste'' what should be done with care. On another treaty issue, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators told reporters at a luncheon meeting they believed compromise eventually will be reached on a move by Democrats to attach to the pact language intended to bind future presidents to the current view of the meaning and impact of the treaty. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> effort `` an egregious insult to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'' and said it will not be settled without a pitched battle `` The Democrats will not let the treaty die because of this but we might come perilously close before someone backs down,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` There is one group trying to kill the treaty and another group trying to embarrass the president, and neither group will win,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., said he also believed the controversy will be resolved `` The Democrats will not let the treaty die on this issue,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. `` I can not believe that when push comes to shove they are going to want to be held responsible by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for failure to ratify this treaty.'' The dispute grew out the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit the deloyment of a strategic defense system The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 17-2 vote on Wednesday to approve the treaty and send it to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where it was expected to be taken up following next week's Easter recess. Ambassador <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator for the treaty, told the committee that the treaty does ban future weapons and that the Soviets understands they are banned. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> said the treaty calls for the elimination of all `` weapon delivery vehicles'' with a range from between 400 miles and 3,400 miles, asserting this covers all weapons, not just those armed with nuclear warheads.

 Five statues of the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were displayed on a tabletop Thursday for members of a special legislative board who will select one of the designs for a monument on the Statehouse lawn. Selection of the winning sculpture design will conclude a yearlong competition that included hundreds of entries from artists around the country. Three of the statues on display at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> were made of white plaster, one of bronze and one, still wet, of clay. They ranged in height from 2 feet to 3 feet. All the finalists show <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in traditional design in full figure. In one submission, he is wearing an open overcoat, which is blowing in the wind. The five semifinalist sculptors are: <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Markham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Jencks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> James </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Isable </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlvain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Legassie </PERSON>, Jr. of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lyme </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` For the past 25 years, since the death of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has been without an official state monument to its beloved native son,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGovern </PERSON>, the commission chairman. `` The absence of the late president from this state's proud display of monuments is about to be corrected with a memorial that every citizen of the commonwealth can be proud of.'' After a brief introduction by former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, <PERSON> MacGovern </PERSON> said the nationwide search for a sculptor was almost over. Paraphrasing <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, <PERSON> MacGovern </PERSON> said, `` this is not the beginning of the end, it is perhaps the end of the beginning.'' Commission members will be casting their votes for a memorial finalist over the next few days. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s daughter and a member of the commission, will attend the April 7 news conference annoucing the winning sculpture. The JFK statue, which will be the commonwealth's official monument to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, will be erected on the west front lawn of the Statehouse. It is hoped that the dedication of the memorial will take place May 29, 1989, which would have been <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 72nd birthday. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a Democrat who was elected president in 1960 and assassinated in 1963, began his political career in the 1940s representing <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Regional Communist Party officials admitted they are powerless to end an ethnic dispute that has led to a massive work stoppage by Armenians in a southern city, and they appealed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for help, a newspaper reported Thursday. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Stepanakert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> unanimously passed a resolution calling on national party leaders to again take up the issue of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians are demanding that the Armenian-dominated region be made part of their republic, which neighbors <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The local committee's appeal, adopted at a meeting Wednesday, did not persuade people to return to work, according to one resident in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. `` People are n't even thinking of going to work,'' said the resident, a man answering the telephone at the <LOCATION> Sovietsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> newspaper Thursday. He refused to identify himself. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the plenary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Stepanakert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was stormy and that one speaker broke down and cried. `` The majority of the Communists decisively condemned the tactic of ` forced pressure' on the country's leadership, and along with that every speaker underlined that the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> problem has not been removed, that it still needs a settlement,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the work stoppage gave new ammunition to people who say Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms permit too much outspokenness. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> party official, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocharyan </PERSON>, as saying that `` continuing worker absences give supporters of the old -LRB- way -RRB- grounds to say: ` Here's your result! You let the people get out of hand. You should n't give them such an occasion.''' <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> did not provide other details of the meeting, and a woman answering the telephone at the city committee's offices referred all questions to the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> workers have vowed to continue the walkout, which began March 24, until the central government and party reverse their decisions to keep <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> under the control of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused the Armenians' demand in February and was asked by the local committee to reconsider the decision The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, ordered cultural and economic improvements for the region on March 23 but did not address the territorial issue. All but bakeries and dairies, some stores and some public transportation and medical clinics have been closed in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> since the strike began. <PERSON> Kocharyan </PERSON> said just 308 workers, only one-fifth of the force, showed up Thursday at the silk factory where he works. `` For me that's zero, and as a party secretary, I'm ashamed for myself and my comrades,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The man at the <LOCATION> Sovietsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> newspaper said there were no demonstrations in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and that few policemen were on the street. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> provided the first official confirmation that <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, was among Armenian nationalists arrested last week in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. The spokesman, at a regular news briefing, said he did not know under which criminal statute Ayrikyan was being held. The Soviet government has forbidden foreign journalists from traveling to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> was asked about that policy after he criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government for barring journalists from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where unrest has raged since December. `` I have to reject your parallel,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` We have not occupied anybody anywhere in this situation.'' He said journalists would have to `` wait a little while'' to visit the region, `` until the passions cool down.''

 The Pompidou Center is displaying more than 400 works by the Russian-born painter <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> that were turned over to the government in lieu of taxes. Many of them have never been seen before in public. `` The value of the collection can not be estimated,'' said Finance Minister <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balladur </PERSON>. `` The government never could have afforded to allocate such sums to enrich the national heritage.'' <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> died in 1985 at his home in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at the age of 97. Working steadily until the end, he left behind a vast private collection of oil paintings, drawings, mosaics, sketches, book illustrations, set designs, and engravings worth countless millions of dollars. The works, previously owned by the <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> family, are displayed in four galleries on the <LOCATION> Pompidou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>'s fourth floor. The works represent the second largest donation ever accepted in lieu of death duties. The largest one came from <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s heirs and constitute what is now the permanent collection of the <ORGANIZATION> Picasso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, housed in the Hotel Sale in central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Government officials have not decided how the Chagall collection will be dispersed among <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s many national museums, but it is likely that works with biblical themes will go to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chagall </ORGANIZATION>'s Biblical Message in Nice. Many of the works on show are known to have been among the ones the artist loved the best. They include `` Bella au Col Blanc,'' -LRB- 1917 -RRB-, a sensitive portrait of his first wife, <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, dressed in a low-cut dark dress, her graceful features and black hair set off by a wide, white collar. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1944. <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> married <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> in 1952. The painting has a cubist touch, and many critics say it is reminiscent of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s masterpiece `` Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' `` The paintings look fine in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but they were n't bad in my house either,'' said <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON>'s widow, known as Vava, during a tour of the show. The exhibition, which runs until June 5, also features `` Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel'' -LRB- 1938-39 -RRB-, set and costume designs created for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Jewish Theater including those for <PERSON> Gogol </PERSON>'s `` Revizor,'' and several self-portraits

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The warning broadcast over the radio for the first time Thursday was simple: three beeps, a pause, then three more beeps. That signal would mean <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has launched a poison gas attack on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, where Iraqi missiles have fallen day and night and where fears of chemical warfare by <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> are growing. After the warning beeps on <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, an announcer said: `` God willing, we hope no such thing will ever happen, but the enemy is so mean and despicable he could do anything.'' An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> escorting visiting Western correspondents around the battered capital, a city of more than 6 million people, said the Iraqis `` would pay dearly if they dared to do it.'' The city of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> seems to have paid enough already. Officials said half of its population has left since <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s missiles began wrecking apartment houses, markets, shops, office buildings, hospitals and schools. On Thursday, many <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> schools and stores stayed closed in case of attack, but people came up to the streets from underground shelters. There were few of the traffic jams for which <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was notorious before the missiles. The missiles that have been rained on the city since Feb. 29, when the Iraqis began firing such weapons into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for the first time in the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it has launched more than 100 surface-to-surface rockets at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in that period. Others have have hit the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, 100 miles to the south, and <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which was the capital of <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION> during the 17th century. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has fired about half as many missiles into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, a city of 5 million. A statement by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> exhorted his people to ignore <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles and turn out for the April 8 parliamentary elections. `` Even if the nation is subjected to missile and bombing attacks, it will go to the ballot box,'' said the statement, read on the radio by an announcer. `` I personally will participate in the elections under any conditions.'' By Thursday, no Iraqi missiles had exploded in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for three days, although other cities were hit. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> declared Thursday that it was suspending attacks for three days because of a visit to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, prime minister of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said they believe the reason is the scheduled arrival Monday of two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holger </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, to investigate the alleged <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> gas attacks in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>. A 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement outlaws the use of chemical weapons. Civilians usually have about four minutes notice of incoming rockets after they are detected by radar installations at the border, about 290 miles to the west. The radio and street loudspeakers blare warnings. People scurry to bomb shelters, basements and underground parking lots. Yellow signs on walls show where shelters are located. State television broadcasts film of Londoners sheltering in subway stations during the German blitz of 1940. The message seems to be that, like <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its Allies, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will win the war. But it is poison gas that residents of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> fear most, according to those questioned randomly on the streets Thursday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Iraqi warplanes dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs on three Kurdish towns in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on March 16-17 after Iranian troops have captured them. The Iranians, at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since September 1980, said 5,000 civilians and some Iranian soldiers were killed, and another 5,000 people were wounded. They claimed the Iraqis dropped chemical bombs because the Kurds, long in rebellion against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, welcomed their `` liberators.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also said Thursday that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped chemical bombs on villages in the <LOCATION> Marivan </LOCATION> border region of northwest <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> earlier in the day, killing several people. After months of international criticism for failing to comply with a cease-fire resolution the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed last summer, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is making all the mileage possible from the claims of chemical warfare. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official press has likened the alleged Iraqi use of gas bombs in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> to the Americans dropping atomic bombs on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> in 1945, and demanded international condemnation of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied the claims.

 An Iranian gunboat was seized last weekend by <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> after an incident at sea during which the boat's skipper was killed in an apparent mutiny, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday. The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, said a lone surviving Iranian crewman remained in Omani custody and that the body of the gunboat's skipper had been recovered. The sources stressed that details of the incident were still sketchy, primarily because the <LOCATION> Omani </LOCATION> government had yet to share much information. But the officials said it appeared the captain was shot and killed by the surviving crewman after tossing a second crewman overboard to his death. A preliminary intelligence report suggests the altercation began when the two crewmen refused the captain's order to mount an attack on a nearby commercial ship, one source added. The officials said it remained unclear whether the Iranian survivor had purposely motored toward <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> after the incident or simply had become disoriented. In either event, he was intercepted by an Omani patrol vessel and taken into custody sometime over the weekend, the sources said. The officials stressed the Pentagon was not attaching any particular significance to the mutiny by suggesting, for example, it demonstrated widespread discord within <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military. `` We think it's an isolated incident,'' said one source. `` But we think it's an interesting isolated incident.'' As recounted by the sources, the affair occurred aboard a Swedish-built Boghammer patrol boat. Those vessels are about 43 feet long and have been modified by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to carry machine guns and other weapons, and used extensively for attacks on Persian Gulf shipping. `` As best we can piece together, the two crewmen refused an order to mount an attack,'' said one source. `` So the skipper threw one of them overboard. At that point, the second crewman shot the skipper. Then he either took the boat to <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> or else got lost.''

 A Canadian military jet having problems with its oxygen system made an emergency landing Thursday at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s Yeager Airport after the pilot became dizzy, officials said. The airport director said the single-seat F-A-18 and another traveling with it landed safely at 4 p.m. The pilot, who was not immediately identified, was treated at the scene and was reported to be OK. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubar </PERSON>, the airport manager, said one jet experienced problems with its liquid oxygen supply and the pilot was forced to seek the nearest airport with military facilities `` The pilot was having problems with his oxygen system and was feeling lght-headed and having problems breathing and decided to put it down,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greter </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Greter </PERSON> said the jets carry liquid oxygen that is coverted into gas. `` He did n't faint. He just felt slightly ill,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jerill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavender </PERSON>, who treated the pilot. <PERSON> Cavender </PERSON> said the pilot was flying at 33,000 feet when the system apparently had problems converting the liquid into gas. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, air traffic control supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the planes were en route from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on a training flight. The <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains facilities at <LOCATION> Yeager </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, refused to comment. Firefighters late Thursday afternoon still were keeping an eye on the slate-gray, 75-foot-long planes parked on a corner of the tarmac. The twin-engine attack jet, known as the Hornet, was built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The planes that landed in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> appeared to have missiles beneath each wing, but it was not clear whether they were live. The plane is designed primarily for air-to-air combat and for air-to-ground bombings. One plane was decorated with an Indian and crossed tomahawks on one of its two tailfins, and the other was decorated with a saber-tooth tiger.

<HEAD>Mulroney Shuffles Cabinet In Pre-Election Buildup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> announced a major Cabinet shuffle Thursday, bringing in an old school friend and changing the key trade and immigration portfolios. `` This puts us in fighting trim for an election, when it comes,'' the prime minister said. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is expected to call an election this fall or early in 1989, well before the August 1989 end of his <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s five-year term. Canadian governments traditionally call early elections when their popularity ratings are high. The most important change was the post of minister for international trade. The combative incumbent, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, was transferred to presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which had been held by Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazankowski </PERSON>. Transport Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON>, an affable Newfoundlander noted for his witty ripostes in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, took over at trade. He will have the task of winning <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of the free-trade agreement reached with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year and selling the country on the 10-year deal. At least two of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 10 provinces, including powerful <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, oppose the treaty, which would dismantle tariffs and loosen other barriers in the world's largest trading partnership. Once a contender for the Conservative leadership, <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> favored free trade long before <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was converted to the concept. Referring to his reputation as a somewhat of a renegade, <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> told reporters: `` I certainly want to be a cannon -LRB- but -RRB- not a loose one.'' The biggest surprise in the reshaping of the 38-member Cabinet was <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s decision to bring in an old friend from his student days at <ORGANIZATION> Laval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since 1985, was named secretary of state and a member of the inner <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> attempted to shore up support in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> province following a series of scandals involving provincial ministers. <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> is a former supporter of the separatist Parti Quebecois and voted in favor of autonomy for the province, dominated by French-speakers, in a 1980 referendum. The referendum was defeated, and <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> eventually joined the Conservative camp. `` I have to prove it is possible to be both a Canadian and a Quebecer,'' <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said Thursday after new Cabinet members were sworn in by Governor General <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauve </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. A lawyer from <LOCATION> Chicoutimi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> is not a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but can serve in the Cabinet pending the next by-election for an empty seat from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. He replaces <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crombie </PERSON> who resigned Wednesday to head a commission on the development of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> waterfront. Employment and Immigration Minister <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> and his deputy, <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, were both shifted from a department that has been criticized by the opposition for the influx of illegal aliens into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, estimated at 2,000 per month. <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> takes over as transport minister, while <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> becomes minister of state for multiculturalism. The Bouchards are not related. The new immigration minister is <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>, formerly in charge of privatization. Her deputy is <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezina </PERSON>, who moves from supply and services. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> kept their jobs. The latest polls show the Conservatives have rebounded this year from their third-place standing over the last two years. Thanks to strong economic growth and a drop in unemployment to 7.8 percent _ a seven-year low _ the Conservatives are neck-and-neck with the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Hog Production Continues To Climb Despite Slimmer Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hog farmers continue to expand production, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed Thursday. As of March 1, the inventory of hogs and pigs in the 10 major pork states totaled an estimated 40.5 million head, up 6 percent from both a year ago and two years ago, the report said. The number of breeding hogs was up 4 percent and 10 percent from March 1 of 1987 and 1986, respectively, to 5.42 million head. That indicated further production increases in the months ahead. Officials said the March 1 inventory of market hogs _ animals headed for slaughter and the consumer market _ totaled 35.1 million head, up 6 percent and 5 percent from the previous two years. The pig crop during the winter months of December, January and February was 15.8 million head, up 6 percent from the same period of 1986-87, the report said, and 11 percent more than in the winter of two years ago. Looking a future prospects, the report said hog farmers surveyed intend to have 2.4 million sows give birth in the March-May period, 2 percent more than a year ago and 11 percent more than the actual farrowings of two years ago. The 10 leading hog states account for about 79 percent of the nation's pork. The following list shows the March 1 inventory. The first number, in thousands, is the total number of hogs in the state, the second is the March 1 figure's percentage of a year earlier.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Sovet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 101,600 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 101,600 tons of corn would be about 4 million bushels. Corn prices recently have been averaging about $ 1.90 per bushel at the farm level, meaning the sale could have a farm value of around $ 7.6 million. The corn is part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 4.1 million tons of corn, plus more than 7.48 million tons of wheat; 818,400 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

 The Assemblies of God state council that wanted <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> barred from preaching for three months will meet Friday and may endorse the harsher penalty demanded by the church's national leaders, a member said Thursday. The TV evangelist had cited the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendation for a three-month ban when he said through his lawyer Wednesday that he would defy the Assemblies national leadership's order that he step down for a year <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21 after tearfully confessing to an undisclosed sin. A prostitute has said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to pose nude for him. Risking dismissal by national church leaders, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> plans to return to preaching May 22, three months after he stepped down, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, national Assemblies of God spokeswoman at the church's headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district presbytery would meet in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s case. She said she had no other details and the national office did not plan to send a representative. The Rev. <PERSON> Ansley </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, one of 19 members of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> council, said there was little the council could do to challenge the penalty imposed by the national body. He said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> probably will leave the denomination. Referring to the church's national leaders, <PERSON> Orfila </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> -LRB- Mo. -RRB- News-Leader: `` The executive presbytery may not have the right to discipline him, but they have the power. I do n't think we'll meet to defy them Maybe it will be just to decide how to handle things.'' Contacted Thursday, <PERSON> Orfila </PERSON> confirmed what he told the newspaper but declined to comment further. State church officials decided to meet Friday after discussing the case in a telephone conference call, the newspaper said. The call was made shortly after the church's national officials announced Tuesday that they had rejected the three-month ban as too lenient. The Rev. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the state church will probably wind up supporting the national recommendation. `` But the men of the district are independent-minded,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> News-Leader </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, said Thursday he was unaware of any meeting by the district council. Meanwhile, one of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s fellow ministers said that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> claimed evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had cast demons out of him and that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s feeling of being released from sin might have played a role in his decision to return to the pulpit this spring. But a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based evangelist said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> did not recommend <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s immediate return to the pulpit. `` If anyone is to report that <PERSON> Oral </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is recommending that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> defy the Assembly of God ruling from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, that is not accurate,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. `` My dad had nothing to do with his decision. We believe that that is a matter that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> must make his own decision and follow the leading of God.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, pastor of the Church on the Move in <LOCATION> Euless </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that while he was visiting <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> in February, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> told him of <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' prayer. `` Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> called him up and told him that he saw demons with long fingernails digging the flesh into <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s body and he cast those demons out of his body,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` I think this explains some of the rationale behind <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>'s decision to return to television after three months.''

 <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> felt `` kind of a redemption'' when she won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her spellbinding and searing song of slavery, `` Beloved.'' `` I thought it was quite possible that the value of the book would not be allowed to be the only consideration that the -LRB- Pulitzer -RRB- committee would have to consider, and that saddened me,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said Thursday. The editor, playwright and author had been the epicenter of a literary earthquake and controversy. After `` Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's lack of recognition <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s `` Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book Critics Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are considered more prestigious. The statement, published as an open letter in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> in January, was signed by such literary figures as the writers <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelou </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wideman </PERSON>, the poet <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and critic <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Beloved,'' they said, was `` a gift to our community, our country, our conscience.'' The statement said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> `` has yet to receive the national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve.'' Although <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said she did n't know a campaign was being mounted on her behalf, when she read the letter, she felt wonderful. `` It says you're valuable to us. It does n't say you're flawless; it just says we esteem you. It's kind of obit information _ the kind of thing you never expect.'' However, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said she was hurt by charges that she had manipulated other writers. `` The only manipulations are between the covers of the book,'' she said. `` There was an article some one read to me on the phone about ` affirmative - action prizes. That's depressing. `` Somebody told me that I should simply come out and declare that I did not want the Pulitzer,'' she continued. `` So I dismissed all of it very happily from my mind until today. And I had genuine astonishment that the committee made a decision on the merits of the book.'' The fiction committee consisted of <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynahan </PERSON>, critic and professor of English at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; critic <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eder </PERSON>, a former Pulitzer winner; and the writer <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moynahan </PERSON> said the jurors made their recommendations six weeks before the letter was published and felt no pressure to recommend <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s book. `` I think her book is one of the greatest American novels I've ever read in my life,'' he said The best-selling `` Beloved,'' published by <PERSON> Knopf </PERSON>, is partly based on a true account of an escaped slaved named <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> who decided to kill her child rather than see her returned to bondage. It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors of slavery; many Africans chose suicide in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> during the crossing on slave ships, and others killed their children or wives before leaving the continent. In language rich and riveting, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> tells the tale of <LOCATION> Sethe </LOCATION>, who escapes from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and struggles to survive in post-bellum <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in a house haunted by her dead baby. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, had heard the Garner story and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman herself. `` In spite of all the political furor about her, the woman was elusive,'' the writer said. `` She was described always as being so serene, so calm. But she said very little. The mystery was not the situation but what goes on inside a woman like that; what was she feeling?'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> editor whose other works include the novels `` Tar Baby'' and `` Song of <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>,'' and the play `` Dreaming <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON>,'' said `` Beloved'' is the best writing she's ever done

 Democratic front-runners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sharply attacked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday as they pointed toward next week's primary showdown in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, criticized for campaigning in an aloof manner, served lunch at a senior citizen center and then served up a stinging up attack on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in an evening speech. `` This administration has walked away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' he said. `` I'm running for president because during the past seven years I've seen too many people thrown out into the streets after decades on the job ... and I've talked to too many local leaders who've seen their communities become ghost towns of boarded up hopes and foreclosed dreams.''

 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called on embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to resign. `` It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simple can not fulfill the requirements of the job,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> deserves due process. We deserve an attorney general,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s troubled legal situation and recent resignations by high <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides were looking ahead to general election strategy, and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> sources said one serious possibility was for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to resign and oversee the campaign. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager in his unsuccessful 1980 run. In contrast, Democrats were still trying to clear up their muddy nomination picture. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> defended his own criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and characterized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as timid on the same score as the Democratic field pointed toward <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, next way station on the campaign marathon. <PERSON> Suellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, the state party chairwoman, said either <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> figures to win in her state. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> began running a television commercial attacking <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> for closing a plant in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was campaigning in what could be his last stand <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were in a close race for the lead in national convention delegates, although neither man had even a third of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s victory in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses last week elevated him to the front rank of the race, to the dismay of some party officials who fear his race and liberal positions would lead to a massive Democratic defeat in the fall if he should be nominated. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, told a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference that there is evidence of a `` Stop Jesse Movement'' forming among Southern Democrats _ and he saw a certain irony in that. `` I would suggest to you that the people involved in this effort are probably people who did not want to see a <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in this race. ... They're now coalescing behind a <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy,'' he said. There is no question that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been the talk of the race since his stunning <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> landslide last Saturday. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who picked up the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, has criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in recent days for lacking experience and for associating in the past with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. He said he was holding <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to the same standard as he would any other politician, and added that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is afraid to say a single word about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the day foraging for votes in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and he told an audience of high school students that it is not always the elected officials who lead the drive for change. `` The reality is that this drive for social justice, this drive for equal protection under the law was led by young <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I was part of the generation, of that leadership. I learned to lead by heading a student body as a college student,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up an endorsemnent from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Congdon </PERSON>, an attorney who headed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s now-defunct campaign in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. And he got some kind words from withdrawn candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. The one-time front-runner in the race said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign has been sending a message to the party's leaders that the voters are dissatisfied with politics as usual. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is as much a messenger to the party leaders as a bearer of his own message,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator also said he has advised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to deliver a series of speeches on the budget deficit, education, military reform and other issues _ and added that he was `` more than prepared'' to help himn write them. Among the Republicans, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not say when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would begin campaigning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he said the situation that once led the president to declare his neutrality in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race had changed following Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s withdrawal from the campaign <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only active challenger, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that the former television evangelist `` recognizes the realities of the situation.''

 Former presidential aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> should be imprisoned for illegally lobbying the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because he flouted the law and compared his offense to `` running a stop sign,'' a prosecutor said Thursday in court papers. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said in a sentencing memo that remarks <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> made following his conviction Feb. 11 showed `` a total lack of remorse or contrition'' about violating the Ethics in Government Act's ban on lobbying former colleagues less than a year afte leaving government service. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 63, should be fined and imprisoned to `` impress present and former government employees, as well as the general public, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended those restrictions to be taken seriously and that they will be enforced with meaningful penalties,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said in the memo filed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>. Minutes after the verdict, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> stood outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse and called the ethics statute `` a lousy law.'' He also said, `` I do n't think I did anything wrong'' and compared the offense to `` running a stop sign.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former political director, repeated his profession of innocence in a Feb. 18 letter to the court that was quoted in the prosecution brief. `` I have never thought, and I do not think today, that I am guilty morally, ethically or legally of the crimes of which I am convicted,'' he wrote. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said `` that intransigent attitude is a consideration arguing in favor of a sentence that includes a period of incarceration.'' The sentencing is scheduled for April 8. `` To request jail time for a 63-year-old man with a spotless record of public service who did not intend to violate the law is ridiculous, unnecessary and totally lacking in compassion,'' said defense lawyer <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> also ignored the advice of lawyers he consulted about the ethics law when he left <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff in early 1982 to form a consulting business with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>. The prosecution brief recounted an incident in which <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> uttered a profanity when one of the attorneys, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Artiano </PERSON>, advised him not to make any White House contacts without first contacting the law firm. During the trial, associate independent counsel <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> related the episode to the judge during a bench conference out of hearing of the jury and the public, according to the trial transcript. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> told the judge that after responding with the profanity, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said, `` These are my friends and I am going back to them if I want to.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> noted in the sentencing memo that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s defense lawyers have `` attempted to minimize the significance of this episode by asserting that defendant <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s profanity ... was characteristic of their client's jocularity.'' `` Perhaps so,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> wrote, `` but his lawyers at the time took the incident seriously. They have told staff members of the independent counsel that this episode caused concern'' within the law firm. `` Whatever his choice of words, however, it is evident that defendant <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was alerted to and deliberately chose to ignore written and oral advice that Section 207 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- of the ethics law -RRB- applied to him,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> does n't recall ever having such a conversation,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. Artiano only recalled it after `` a lot of prompting'' during `` repeated interviews with the independent counsel and numerous sessions with the grand jury,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. `` Even <PERSON> Artiano </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> was joking when he said it and thereafter <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> came and asked for their advice about Ethics in Government Act matters,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> did not allow the defense to argue during the trial that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> acted with advice of legal counsel when he lobbied the White House. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined up to $ 10,000 on each of three counts of illegally lobbying the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maritime engineers' union and the manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s A-10 anti-tank plane <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> did not make a specific recommendation about the length of the prison term but said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> should be fined cumulatively for each of the three convictions. `` <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s special entree to the most powerful officials in government, including the president himself, epitomized the very danger to public perception about the integrity of governmental decision-making that motivated <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact the one-year no-contact prohibition,'' the prosecutor said.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called Thursday for the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and said, `` It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simply can not fulfill the requirements of the job.'' The presidential hopeful, a longtime critic of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he is `` appalled at the state of emergency'' there. He blamed the problems on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tolerance of what he called a low moral tone in the administration. `` Justice is the jugular vien of democracy. With justice, almost everything is possible,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told at rally of about 2,000 at the <ORGANIZATION> Sheboygan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION>. `` Without justice, almost nothing is possible.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> must go because he is being consumed defending himself against allegations of wrongdoing. The candidate called the recent resignations of top Justice officials `` a national disgrace'' because, he said, they left `` rather than have their reputations sullied in association with the attorney general.'' To an enthusiastic, mostly white crowd which cheered his attacks on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` Increasingly, the administration of justice is being sacrificed to the defense of the attorney general. ... This is not a question of the shameful prospect of an attorney general who spends more time in court as a defendant than as a prosecutor.'' The attorney general must take the lead in shaping national policies to cut drug traffic and reduce crime, activities that simply take a great deal of time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> argued. `` It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simply can not fulfill the requirements of the job. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> deserves due process. We deserve an attorney general,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> will probably not resign, so <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> must ask him to leave. `` Today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, once again there is a leadership vacuum in this collapsing administration,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> does not have the judgment to submit his resignation. The president does not exercise leadership to ask for it. The vice president _ now leader of his party _ does not have the strength to get the president to act,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` So the nation must depend _ once again _ on Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' Then, taking the line from Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s drug campaign, the Democrat added: `` When Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> asks Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> whether he should stay on, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should advise him, ` Just say no.''' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not respond directly to attacks from fellow Democratic candidate Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on his lack of govermental experience. But the civil rights activist did so by implication. `` Some officeholders are not leaders,'' he said in <LOCATION> Sheboygan </LOCATION>. `` All leaders are not officeholders.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Southside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked to 2,000 students about the nature of leadership. He detailed major civil rights achievements _ the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION>, voting rights, open housing _ and then talked about who was responsible. `` These rich achievments are in some elected officials' resumes, but the reality is that this drive for social justice, this drive for equal protection under the law was led by young <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I was part of the generation, of that leadership,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Southside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> was the site of sometimes violent confrontations during the 1960s as activists marched into all-white neighborhoods to support open housing laws. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received a warm welcome from the mostly white crowd. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who said Wednesday he believes a `` stop <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'' movement is afoot, told a news conference that `` while there is evidence that a movement aimed at stopping <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has been mounted by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> detractors, we have not yet identified exactly who they are.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> speculated that `` the architects of Super Tuesday are behind this.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up the endorsement of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Congdon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Waukesha </LOCATION> lawyer who headed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign in the state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is on the air in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> with a $ 40,000 television buy, said campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>.

 The Charlotte Observer on Thursday won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for public service for its coverage of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> financial scandal that brought down <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and created turmoil in televangelism. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> paper, the Wall Street Journal and The Miami Herald each took two of the awards. In its citation for the public service award, one of six Pulitzers awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> papers, the prize board said the Observer revealed misuse of funds by the ministry `` through persistent coverage conducted in the face of a massive campaign by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to discredit the newspaper.'' The other prize-winning <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> papers are The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. In the arts, novelist <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> _ whose failure to win other writing awards over the past year caused a literary controversy _ received the Pulitzer for fiction for her novel `` Beloved.'' `` Driving Miss Daisy'' by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhry </PERSON> and `` The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> won the prizes for drama and general non-fiction, respectively. Winners reacted gleefully to the news. `` I'm in a state of slack-jawed dumbfoundedness,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shales </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, who won the criticism award for his writings on television. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> of the Inquirer celebrated his national reporting award _ for a series of reports on a secret Pentagon budget used to sponsor defense research and an arms buildup _ by climbing on a desk and lighting up a stogie, while listening to his colleagues' applause <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said he felt as if he had just received a `` $ 10 million check from <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. I'm just a very happy guy and very lucky.'' Pulitzers for general news reporting went to the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> for an investigation of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate, and to the Lawrence -LRB- Mass. -RRB- Eagle-Tribune for stories that showed flaws in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough system. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Baquet </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipinski </PERSON> won the Pulitzer for investigative reporting for stories on `` the self-interest and waste that plagued <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> won the Pulitzer for explanatory journalism for stories about an investment banker charged with insider trading and about the day after the October stock market crash. The Journal's other Pulitzer _ for specialized reporting _ went to <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanich </PERSON> for a series on faulty testing by medical laboratories. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> won the Pulitzer for international reporting for what the Pulitzer board termed `` balanced and informed coverage of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> also won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s two awards came in commentary and feature photography. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> won the former for what the board called `` consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns''; <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> duCille </PERSON> won the latter for photographs of the decay and rehabilitation of a housing project with a cocaine problem.

<TEXT>
 A sophisticated, ultralight aircraft run by human power made six successful test flights Thursday preparing for a record distance attempt inspired by the 3,500-year-old Greek myth of <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>. The record attempt was to be made Friday, but organizers of the 3-year-old, $ 1 million project postponed the flight until the weekend because gusts of up to 30 mph are expected Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> project is aimed at breaking the world record for human-powered flight over the 74-mile distance from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> to the island of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>, also known as Thira. Thursday's test flights each lasted less than three minutes in calm dawn weather above a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> air force base next to <LOCATION> Iraklion </LOCATION> airport. Flight Director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussulari </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> aerospace expert, told reporters the 68-pound <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 `` is in good shape ... and we may see favorable conditions'' for a flight Saturday or Sunday. Five pilots _ four Americans and a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> _ took turns pedaling the pink-and-silver ultralight at speeds of about 14 mph, flying about 15 feet above the tarmac. The craft is named in honor of the mythical inventor <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>, who tried with his son <PERSON> Icarus </PERSON> to escape from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> on wings made of feathers and wax. <PERSON> Daedalus </PERSON> succeeded, but <PERSON> Icarus </PERSON> flew too near the sun, the wax melted and he fell into the sea. The record flight requires temperatures below 70 degrees and almost dead calm. Conditions appeared perfect Thursday following nine days of blustery weather. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Scioscia </PERSON>, 27, a professional cyclist from <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, reported, `` It feels like a day for the record, pretty calm. I was flying the plane with no hands.'' But <PERSON> Bussulari </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 would have run into strong headwinds about five miles off <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> and that in any case, `` We felt we needed a test flight to shake down the airplane.'' The pilots are taking turns standing by in readiness for the flight. The pilot who had been scheduled to fly Friday was <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, whose father was born in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The pilot pumps bicycle pedals that turn the ultralight's propeller He uses a joystick to steer the plane, coordinating with ground-based radio instructions. `` For the record the pilot must keep pedaling a steady 15 mph but the effort is equivalent to riding 23 miles an hour on land,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremml </PERSON>, a medical student from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Tremml set the 37.2-mile world record for human-powered flight in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1987, flying a <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> prototype Two backup flying machines are ready if needed. All the craft are made of lightweight composite material _ graphite epoxy, plastic fiber and mylar, an extra-thin plastic skin that covers the 112-foot wingspan. Its organizers said the Daedalus project has produced new information on endurance and low altitude flying aerodynamics and meteorology during its three years of development. Project director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> explained, `` The project does have a research and educational application, particularly in human physiology and aeronautics. The plane itself does n't have any practical application. It should be seen as a work of art.''

<TEXT>
 Israeli forces left their self-proclaimed `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Thursday afternoon in pursuit of <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> communist guerrillas who tried to infiltrate, police reported. They said three guerrillas were wounded in a 30-minute firefight four miles into the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>, north of the security zone. A guerrilla who escaped told reporters in the Syrian-policed town of <LOCATION> Hasbaya </LOCATION> there were at least four Israeli casualties. Israeli authorities did not comment on the claim and it could not be verified independently. Police said the eight-man guerrilla squad was caught trying to infiltrate into the zone, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established north of its border in 1985 after withdrawing most of its occupation army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Two helicopter gunships strafed olive groves on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>'s slopes as about 40 soldiers chased the fleeing guerrillas, police said Militiamen of the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> left the zone on Wednesday to attack Shiite Moslem guerrillas in the village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roumman </LOCATION>, with the aid of Israeli gunships. Police said seven people, including two <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, were killed and 15 wounded in and around <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roumman </LOCATION>.

 The White House announced steps Thursday to encourage American companies to withhold payments from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and warned that mandatory action will be considered if the voluntary measures are not sufficient. The action follows the disclosure that some American firms are paying taxes and fees to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for doing business there, undercutting the economic sanctions imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to force the ouster of strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Announcing the new action, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` we are giving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and persons an incentive and opportunity not to provide financial support to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. `` Should these measures prove insufficient, we will review additional legal steps that may be necessary to deny transfer of funds to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and persons,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government payments owed the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be deposited in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already is withholding canal fees, toll payments and other funds. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said withholding taxes for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employes in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and rental payments also will go in the new account. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will take part in legal cases by private parties who owe debts to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, declaring President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is the legitimate leader of the country. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will help establish an account for payment of funds in these cases. Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will issue guidance explaining how tax credits can be claimed for Panamanian income taxes paid into an account at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, instead of to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did know how much money would be involved by the action, but estimated it could deprive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of `` millions and millions.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 92-1 to approve a resolution urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to act at once to cut off the flow of dollars from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has received an infusion of an estimated $ 19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $ 5.5 million of that money reportedly came from taxes and fees paid by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> confirmed they had made payments to the Panamanian government and said they were a routine part of their business there. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration understands the legal concerns of the companies involved. `` I'm not trying to cast any blame or concern upon them. That was the system. They've got their laws. They've got things they've got to comply with and we're trying to help them through changes in <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> regulation.'' He played down the amount of money involved, saying it was not significant. Asked if it was not a setback for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` It's a minor setback in the sense that one day there's zero -LRB- money -RRB- and the next day there's something, but these are fairly small payments in the total picture and are not going to solve Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s very serious and long-term problem.'' He said the administration was studying a plan by which the companies would make tax payments into an account in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> controlled by President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who has been in hiding since demanding <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution was introduced by Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` The use of these monies -LRB- paid by American companies -RRB- has enabled Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to buy himself time and prolong himself in power as he ruthlessly continues in his efforts to thwart the democratic will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and crush the general strike,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. The resolution urges <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use his authority under the Emergency Economic Powers Act `` to prevent future transfers to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime of currency and credit subject to the jurisdiction of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' It also urges <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to consider placing such funds into an escrow account until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is ousted and democratic rule restored in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Only Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., voted against the resolution He did not explain the reasons for his vote. In another legislative move, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenburger </PERSON>, R-Minn., introduced legislation to deny <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign tax credits to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies which have made tax payments to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime `` In effect, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer is not going to subsidize the illegal <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government,'' <PERSON> Durenburger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said its payments covered corporate income, sales and excise taxes due for March. He said the company does not see any conflict with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions. `` We continue our operations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> based on normal commercial considerations,'' <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said. `` We do not become involved in any political activity in a host nation; we're just doing business down there.'' Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said the airline paid about $ 178,000 in cash for monthly operating fees, including navigational aids, communications, airport rentals and landing fees. `` There is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary about these payments,'' she said. Meanwhile, a group of 13 senators urged the administration to make arrangements to help <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banking system resume normal operations after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the senators suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> use the resources of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to provide the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> with a line of credit for the Panamanian banking system. The senators said the funds should be made available only after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is satisfied that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> acted to eliminate the use of Panamanian banks `` by drug traffickers to shield illegal activities.'' The letter was signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass; <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt.; <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn.; <PERSON> John </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senators Says They Will Suspend Arms to Saudis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bipartisan group of 31 senators urged the administration Thursday to suspend all arms sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> until the Arab kingdom withdraws the Chinese-made missiles deployed in its desert. In a letter to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the senators asked the administration to reconsider its planned notification to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of a $ 450 million support package for AWACS radar surveillance planes. The money is for training and maintenance of the sophisticated intelligence planes which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sold the Saudis. In light of recent revelations that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is deploying Chinese-made intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range of about 1,850 miles, `` we strongly believe that our current policy toward arms sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> must be re-examined,'' the letter said. `` In light of the tremendous threat to regional security, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should reconsider any new arms sales to the kingdom until this matter is fully resolved and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles are withdrawn,'' the senators wrote. They also urged the administration to `` make unequivocable its absolute opposition to the presence of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles, which represent a new and grave threat to the peace of the region.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will be meeting with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> next week during a shuttle mission to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> which begins Sunday. He will be lobbying for Israeli-Arab peace talks, but is also expected to bring up the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> already expressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern about the sale of the CSS-2 rockets to the Saudis when he spoke in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this month with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it views the missiles as part of a disturbing trend of missile proliferation in the gulf region and in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbia </LOCATION>, an ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s, says it needed the missiles to protect itself in case of a further escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, especially in view of Iranian threats. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the Saudis bought the missiles in frustration over repeated attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to block <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> arms sales. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> began negotiating the deal with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> in 1985, after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late last year agreed to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Saudis </ORGANIZATION> 24 F-15s in order to maintain Saudi air strength at its current levels. The CSS-2 rockets, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say are not yet operational, also have a nuclear capability. But both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have assured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> they do not intend to arm the rockets with nuclear warheads. `` We are also deeply concerned that the Saudis hid the fact that they possess these weapons,'' the letter said. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> reportedly concealed from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the deal with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for two years, before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerial intelligence photos exposed the deal. `` I am most concerned that our intelligence services were unable to detect the acquisition of these missiles,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> called on Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, to hold hearings about the missiles when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from Easter recess next month. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said the committee must discuss, among other things, `` what this -LRB- intelligence -RRB- failure suggests about our government's ability to detect'' intermediate-range nuclear missiles in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> is strongly opposed to the U.S.-Soviet treaty which eliminates such missiles from both countries' arsenals.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Group Offers Direct Talks With Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s main rebel movement called Thursday for peace talks with the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> to end a 13-year bush war. In a statement released in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, the rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` ready now to start talks with the -LRB- governing party -RRB- without preconditions.'' The note was signed by <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, leader of the guerrillas, who receive aid from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It said the future of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` depends on the will of all Angolans to free themselves from foreign tutelage.'' The note also said `` peace will come necessarily from direct contact'' between the guerrilla group and the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>. The guerrillas have fought the government since losing a civil war to the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> following <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. The insurgents have demanded a power-sharing accord. Angolan government officials estimate more than 9,000 South African troops are in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> aiding the guerrillas. Soviet advisers and approximately 40,000 Cuban troops aid the government forces. The note said the guerrilla group `` categorically rejects all fictitious interpretation of reconciliation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by way of amnesty, clemency or any so-called program of harmony.'' The point was an apparent reference to reports Wednesday that the government was willing to offer amnesty to the guerrillas if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halt all support for the insurgents. The guerrilla proposal comes on the heels of discussions among the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on an end to foreign aid to both sides.

 Church leaders said Thursday they are working with the authorities to ease restrictions on religion in a society dominated by atheists, but may fail unless clerical dissidents stop causing trouble. Metropolitan Filaret of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galitsky </PERSON> said the Rev. <PERSON> Gleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, and the Rev. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainov </PERSON> were two of those in the Russian Orthodox church who seek `` to press on us methods of solving our problems that would lead to confrontation between church and state.'' He described the dissidents as a small group of priests and lay people. The church always has cooperated with the government, which is dominated by the officially atheist <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but its leaders say they want to moderate a 1929 law that requires registration of religious groups and prevents charitable activities and religious education of the young. Although they did not directly attack the law during a news conference, their veiled criticisms appeared to be among the strongest in years. <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON> stressed, however, that the church `` will continue to use the same method of solving problems it has used in the whole post-revolutionary period.'' Last week, <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> called for the resignation of Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>, 78, as head of the Russian Orthodox church on grounds he is ill and senile. The priest also has criticized the willingness of church leaders to subordinate themselves to the government, demanding greater freedom to practice religion and publication of more religious books. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> was excluded from the ministry for 20 years, but reinstated last year and assigned to a small parish outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Contacted by telephone Thursday night, <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON>'s comments were moderate `` Earlier they -LRB- church leaders -RRB- would have taken our work away and imprisoned us. It's a sign of perestroika that they are willing to listen to us,'' <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said, referring to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s word for restructuring of society. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said he and Gainov are not seeking confrontation between church and state but simply want to `` help the church improve its situation.'' `` We think church leaders are falling behind matters of perestroika and want them to work more actively,'' he said. <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON> said the church has the right to discipline dissidents, but `` we are urging them to use common sense and join with us to solve the problems.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Kiril </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> said the government is rewriting the 1929 law and consulting Russian Orthodox officials, but described the consultations as a `` discussion of principle'' not involving the text. <PERSON> Kiril </PERSON> said the law, adopted at the height of anti-religious fervor after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, was no longer appropriate for Soviet society. He said the replacement statute should be ready soon, but the text was not complete and he could not provide details. The archbishop said church officials were optimistic that it `` will open the possibility for a fuller church life for all believers.'' A list was revealed of nine people who will be made saints during celebrations in June of the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Metropolitan Yuvenali of <PERSON> Krutitsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolomensky </PERSON> granted that the list did not include anyone killed during the repression after the revolution, as critics have demanded. He said study of the issue would continue. Yuvenali accused the Russian Orthodox church that split away after the revolution and now is based abroad of canonizing such people for political purposes. Church officials said Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> participated in opening and closing ceremonies and fulfilled his other obligations during a three-day conference completed Thursday.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet fighter slammed into the middle of this small town and exploded Thursday, killing the American pilot and at least one resident, injuring 16 people and forcing scores to evacuate. `` The neighborhood looks like the bombed-out houses of World War II,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loef </PERSON>, a 52-year-old baker who lives down the street from where the F-16 crashed into at least five homes. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> identified the pilot as Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Oroville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He entered active duty in May 1985 and had been at Hahn Air Base since September 1987. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. Wreckage was scattered over a wide area, and several hours after the flames had been doused, black smoke still billowed from <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, a town of 6,000 people. Emergency crews evacuated more than 70 residents because the plane was carrying a canister of hydrazine, which is used to restart engines and which produces toxic gas when mixed with water. Officials said there was no evidence of a gas leak. The plane crashed eight miles from a nuclear power plant, one day after a French jet fighter crashed and exploded just a mile from a nuclear plant in the West German state of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. The pilot in that accident also was killed. The crashes sparked calls from members of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the environmentalist Greens party for more restrictions on military training flights Witnesses reported seeing smoke and flames pouring from the F-16 as it plunged toward <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. It struck the roof of one house, tore off the front of another and set several on fire, they said. <PERSON> Hilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Loef </PERSON> said her first thought when she saw the jet was, `` My God, the planes are coming awfully low today.'' `` Then I saw smoke and flames streaming out of the jet,'' she said. The body of <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, 60, was found in the wreckage of his home, officials said. Rescuers were searching for any other victims. Twelve firefighters were hospitalized for smoke inhalation, two residents were treated for shock, and two more were being held for observation in a hospital after apparently suffering smoke inhalation, officials said. Authorities said the 10 a.m. disaster could have been far worse had the plane crashed a couple of hours earlier, before residents left for work. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told reporters at the scene that an investigation into the cause of the crash was under way. He said there was no live ammunition on the jet. The F-16 was part of the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing based at the <ORGANIZATION> Hahn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the nearby <LOCATION> Eifel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Neunherz </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The crash occurred 185 miles west of Wednesday's crash of the French jet fighter, which went down in the Bavarian village of <LOCATION> Ohu </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Isar </LOCATION> nuclear plant. Environmentalists maintained the country had escaped disaster by a `` split second,'' and the accident raised concerns about military flights over nuclear power plants. But officials said the concrete domes built over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> nuclear plants are designed to withstand the force of a plane crash, so there was no danger of a nuclear accident.

<TEXT>
 After hours of backroom negotiations Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> let stand its dismissal of the third and strongest impeachment charge against Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The decision not to reinstate the charge cleared the way for final arguments Monday on two other counts against the first-term Republican. Senators could vote Monday or Tuesday on whether he should be removed from office. `` Is there any other matter to be taken up?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> as the senators convened in the late afternoon after a day of caucuses and private meetings. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s question was answered with silence <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> then wished the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> luck in reading and understanding a thick stack of legal instructions given to them as they left for the weekend. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> 63, is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in six decades to face an impeachment trial. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided 16-12 to dismiss a charge that he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan and to vote to convict or acquit on two other charges _ that he tried to obstruct an investigation of an alleged death threat by a staff member and that he misused $ 80,000 from a protocol fund. The campaign loan charge was considered the strongest of the three because there is more extensive documentation of what occurred and because it is the only one that also has led to a criminal indictment against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. In contrast, the obstruction charge boils down in part to which of two people to believe, and the other in part to technical definitions of whether the $ 80,000 was public or private money. Several senators, in voting for dismissal, had said they feared they would prejudice <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial April 21 if they took evidence on the last charge. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, Democratic minority leader, said Thursday neither he nor the 10 other Democrats who voted for dismissal were willing to reconsider. One of those who voted on the prevailing side would have had to seek reconsideration for the matter to be reopened. `` There was a lot of backroom manipulating today,'' said <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. `` People apparently made their decisions on the merits of the arguments and that did n't change in 24 hours.'' Only five of the 19 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans supported the dismissal of the last charge. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules gave members 24 hours to rescind any action. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said his main concern was not letting the trial drag on past <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s scheduled May 17 recall election. But some Republicans argued that they were duty-bound to hear all the evidence on all the charges. Republican <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> complained angrily that the Democrats had divided the impeachment proceeding along partisan lines for the first time since it began Feb. 29. `` That action yesterday was political roulette,'' he said. `` If there are not the votes to convict, and Gov. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is back on the ninth floor -LRB- in the governor's office -RRB- on Wednesday ... they have dealt themselves a losing hand,'' West said. It would require a two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. If he is convict, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may then take a vote to disqualify him from ever holding office again.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer sent to prison on state charges in an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> crash that killed 16 people was indicted Thursday on federal charges including lying to investigators about his drug use the day of the accident. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, was charged with conspiracy, obstruction of an agency investigation and making false statements, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Breckinridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>. The collision of the passenger train and three locomotives operated by <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was the worst accident in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> history. The indictment alleges <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> lied under oath to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators after the Jan. 4, 1987, crash near <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, saying he had not consumed any drugs that day. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, however, shared a marijuana cigarette with brakeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> that day, according to the statement of facts read into the record when he pleaded guilty in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 17. The indictment also alleges <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> falsely testified about the status of the signals he saw in the three <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives and along the tracks that day and about what pre-departure tests he conducted. The conspiracy count alleges he joined with <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> to develop a false story about what happened. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was the only person named in the indictment. If convicted, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $ 1,000 on a misdemeanor charge of manslaughter by locomotive. Sixteen people were killed and more than 170 others were injured in the crash. Gates originally was charged with 16 counts, but <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> agreed to a plea bargain, merging the names of all 16 victims into a single count. <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said he had deferred any federal action against <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> until the state prosecution had ended. `` Now that those charges have been resolved, it is appropriate to vindicate the strong federal interest in ensuring that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearings are not obstructed by those with the most direct and relevant information,'' the prosecutor said.

 Supporters of slain judicial candidate <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> asked Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> on Thursday to convene a special legislative session to allow another minority candidate to seek the post. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was noncommittal after the closed meeting in his office. He said he would consult with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s former opponent, party and legislative leaders and others, and expected to reach a decision next week. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 42, a Lumbee Indian attorney, was shot to death Saturday at his rural home in racially troubled <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where he was running for a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeship. At first, authorities said the killing looked like a political assassination. But Tuesday they arrested a young Indian man and said a second suspect committed suicide, and attributed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s killing to a romantic dispute <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who is white, were slated to meet in the May 3 Democratic primary. Under law, if a candidate dies more than 30 days after filing for a primary has closed, his opponent wins the nomination. In this case, there is no Republican in the race, so <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> would also automatically win the general election in November. Supporters of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> asked for a special session to amend the law to let another candidate enter the race. The governor, who planned to meet with <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> on Friday, told reporters: `` I'm going to do my best to try to get input that I need and then take a brief time to think about it very prayfully and come up with the best answer that I can.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeship was created under a law intended to help a non-white candidate get elected in a county where blacks and Indians make up 58 percent of the registered voters. Two months ago, the Robesonian newspaper office was seized for several hours by two <ORGANIZATION> Lumbees </ORGANIZATION> who said they wanted to call attention to racial injustice and official corruption. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, who was manager of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s campaign, said that was pleased with the discussion with the governor and that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` listened to every word. ... I was impressed with him.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> supporters have decided on a replacement candidate, <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said, but he declined to identify the person. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> has not commented on the special session question. Earlier, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said there was no reason to doubt that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s slaying resulted from a romantic dispute He chided those who continue to suggest otherwise, saying some want to stir up more racial strife in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` There are people who want to take advantage of the problems ... and they're going to make up all kinds of theories,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Sheriff <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goins </PERSON>, 24, killed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and later took his own life. <PERSON> Goins </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for disrupting <PERSON> Goins </PERSON>' relationship with the daughter of a woman <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was dating, according to Stone The other suspect, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>, is described as a longtime friend of <PERSON> Goins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Goins </PERSON> had left suicide notes and that there was solid evidence linking him to the slaying. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellecourt </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Goins </PERSON>' personal feelings `` could have been manipulated by those that would have motives to see that <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was out of the way.''

 A bikini contest planned for Thursday night by a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> fraternity to raise money for charity was canceled hours before it was to begin after women students threatened to picket. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Giarusso </PERSON>, assistant general manager of the off-campus <ORGANIZATION> Pink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> bar where the contest was to have been held, said the makers of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> beer withdrew as sponsors. `` There are no prizes and the event has been canceled,'' he said. He refused further comment. Women had earlier vowed to picket the bar, and 34 students had signed a petition denouncing the contest organized by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> as sanctioning `` ogling and girl watching.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, chairman of the fund-raising committee of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION>, said the contest was canceled `` because of a small, vocal minority. We did not back down. It is our legal right to have the contest.'' <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, a UMass graduate student and an organizer of the protest, was making placards for the demonstration when she learned the contest was off. `` We're all stunned,'' she said. `` We're pleased that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> was sensitive to this issue to help us achieve our cause.'' `` Often women are reduced to their body parts in this society and we do n't think men have a right to judge us for our bodies,'' protester <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> said earlier. `` This is objectifying women to make money off us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity brothers said they did n't understand the furor. `` It's ridiculous,'' said fraternity president <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>. `` Why should they be upset if it's a fund-raiser? They do it everywhere else.'' He added: `` If they go to the beach, are they going to call that sexist too?'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> had said proceeds of the contest would be used by the fraternity, which has $ 10 in its account, for its yearly beer keg roll, a charity event that benefits the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fund </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> blushed happily and climbed on top of a desk Thursday as his colleagues at The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer applauded after he captured the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shales </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> was in shock. `` I'm in a state of slack-jawed dumbfoundedness,'' said <PERSON> Shales </PERSON>, the winner for criticism for his writing on television. `` I'm shocked and delighted and very proud of the paper It's an award that really comes to the paper _ not to me; it's a nice feeling to have brought it to the paper.'' Reporters at the Inquirer, which claimed its 14th prize in 13 years, crowded around the newsroom and applauded when word of <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s prize moved on The Associated Press wire. The recipient, who won for his series on a secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget used to sponsor defense research and an arms buildup, climbed onto a desk to say, `` I thank you very much.'' He then puffed on a cigar. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, 31, who came to the Inquirer in 1982 from the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said he feels like he just received a `` $ 10 million check from <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. I'm just a very happy guy and very lucky.'' <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, winner of the fiction award for `` Beloved,'' said joy was uppermost in her feelings because `` I really was thinking dark and difficult thoughts about what was available to this book in terms of recognition.'' The book became a center of controversy when it did not win two other major literary prizes, and <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said she respected the Pulitzer committee for ignoring `` outside matters of speculation and gossip and some slander.'' <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers won six awards, including two each at The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer and one each at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> and the Inquirer. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> president, said the group has `` worked hard over the years to attract some of the best people in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspaper business and create a climate that encourages people to do their best work.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, the 40-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> humorist who won for commentary, said he hopes winning the Pulitzer `` will make me taller.'' `` It's fun to win a Pulitzer; everybody should do it,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. His fellow <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> staff member, photographer <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> duCille </PERSON>, garnered his second Pulitzer for photos of apartments inundated by the drug crack. `` I do n't want to lessen the Pulitzers, but I feel more proud that the photos ... made changes in the community,'' duCille said. Cartoonist <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON>, 37, who moved from The Charlotte Observer to The Atlanta Constitution during the year, was honored for work done at both papers. He said his biting approach can be traced in part to `` a grandmother bayoneted by a guardsman during a mill strike in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. There are some rebellious genes floating around in me.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, `` There was a lot of dancing and yelling and singing when the announcement came over the wire _ but that's not unusual for the Journal newsroom,'' quipped <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharpe </PERSON>, managing editor. The Journal and the Lawrence -LRB- Mass. -RRB- Eagle-Tribune each won an award for general news reporting; the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> paper's series dealt with infant mortality. `` The Journal decided it was time to commit some resources to the problem,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive editor of the Journal and its sister daily, The Montgomery Advertiser. `` A Pulitzer Prize is nice,'' said <PERSON> Tharpe </PERSON>, `` but it's a plaque on the wall. If we hope something will come of our work as journalists, it's that the state will deal with the problem of infant mortality.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, the winners were <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Baquet </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipinski </PERSON> for investigative reporting on `` on the self-interest and waste that plague <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We're thrilled. It's been quite a few years since we've won one here for local news coverage,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Soeteber </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> managing editor for metropolitan news. `` I think the team of reporters deserved this so much. ... It was their idea, and they brought it off beautifully,'' she said. `` I'm so glad some of the leaders in our profession recognized it.'' The Wall Street Journal captured two prizes: <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanich </PERSON> for specialized reporting and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> for explanatory journalism. `` I know many great people who have only been recognized after they died, but all else being equal, it's wonderful to get recognition,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 36. `` If I can win the Pulitzer Prize, the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> can win the pennant this summer,'' said <PERSON> Bogdanich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a photographer for the <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- American, said he had not been expecting to win the spot news award for his coverage of the 58-hour operation that rescued little <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> and fascinated a nation. `` I am pretty young. I am just pretty surprised,'' said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 24. `` Ever since I took the photo that night, the editors said I was going to win. They were sure of it that night. And so it happened.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday of looking for a pretext to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and said it ordered its military not to harm Americans in the country. Government offices closed Thursday for a long Easter weekend that looks bleak for 130,000 public employees, who were left without paychecks for the second time this month. An eerie quiet gripped the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which had been filled in recent days with demonstrations against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander who controls the civilian government. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, the president installed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and its waters constituted a threat to the country. `` In spite of the situation created by the mobilization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces ... the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have orders to refrain from using lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilians,'' said the letter, released by the presidency. The `` mobilization'' of forces apparently referred to the passage this week of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter carrier <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that began in early March. `` Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of acts of war against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the letter said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has raised the possibility that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military might be used to protect the estimated 50,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> against possible harrassment by that country's security forces. It made the suggestion after Panamanian soldiers arrested and beat several journalists, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporters, during a raid Monday on a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel. With most businesses and industries observing an 11-day-old general strike against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Thursday, the largest congregations of people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were found in the food lines of welfare agencies. Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan new strategies in their frustrated effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go from here,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON>, a director of the Crusade, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor, political and other groups. In <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, former President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> said he understood <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had promised to resign in May, the unofficial start of a presidential campaign leading to elections in May 1989. The general is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. Major supermarkets and drug stores, and a few small shops, were open Thursday in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but most merchants observed the strike. The groceries and pharmacies reopened Wednesday _ under heavy government pressure, according to reports. The government closed its doors without meeting another $ 33 million payday for most ot its 130,000 employees despite the collection this week of $ 19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $ 5.5 million was said to be taxes and fees from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and a banana-growing subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the White House announced tax incentives and other measures Thursday to encourage American companies to withhold payments from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said mandatory action would be considered if the voluntary measures are not sufficient. Most Panamanians were short of cash and food as a result of the strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in part by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> freeze on Panamanian assets in American banks. The sanctions were imposed in February after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted to oust <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian president, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, in retaliation for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s attempt to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Banks have been closed since March 3. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had promised Monsignor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, that he would step aside upon completion of his term of service in May. But by law, military officers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are supposed to resign after 25 years of active service, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s official biography shows that he entered the service in 1962, or 26 years ago. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> asked <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> to serve as a mediator between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his opponents.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday appeared to be just days away from the moment of truth in Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial after dismissing the third and most serious charge against him Senators declined to predict the outcome of next week's vote on the two remaining charges. A two-thirds majority of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be needed to remove the first-term Republican from office. `` I'm prepared to vote,'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON> said one day after testimony was completed on the second impeachment count. Like other senators, she declined to say what she had decided. Many senators said they will wait until Monday's closing arguments by prosecution and defense lawyers before deciding whether to remove <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office. The vote is likely to be taken Monday or Tuesday on impeachment charges that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official and that he misused $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. But before the vote could be taken, senators had to resolve a last-minute political imbroglio Thursday over the dismissal of the third charge, that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan. Wednesday's surprise vote to dismiss that article and vote on the first two led to charges and counter-charges by Republicans and Democrats that each side was playing politics. After a day of backroom negotiations Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided against reinstating the third charge. Wednesday's action was approved by all 11 Democrats but only five of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 19 Republicans. Attorneys had indicated Wednesday it would take at least five weeks to present the case on the third charge. Republican Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, who opposed throwing out the article, said the dismissal was a `` serious error'' and added, `` Frankly, I'm resentful, at this late stage in these proceedings, that we're cutting deals as if this were an amendment to another piece of legislation in order to get us out before adjournment. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> was more philosophical, saying, `` It's a political trial. It's just a matter of the way we work.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> wanted the $ 350,000 loan count dismissed on grounds that having it tried first in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would taint his April 21 criminal trial on similar charges. The 16-12 vote to grant the governor's wish resulted from a combination of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s five staunchest <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> backers _ who want all the charges dismissed _ and all 11 Democrats, who have been trying for weeks to force the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to vote on each impeachment article as evidence is completed. The Democrats contended their strategy was aimed at ensuring a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on whether to remove <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office well before he is to face a May 17 recall election. Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a Democrat, said Republicans possibly `` saw the potential for some to take advantage of this ... and create a situation where they would never, never have to cast a vote on this'' because <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could be removed from office by the recall before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> got a chance to vote. Because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can make its own rules, lawmakers will not have to reach their conclusions `` beyond a reasonable doubt,'' as in a criminal trial. Instead, they are to decide if there is `` clear and convincing evidence'' to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, and it's up to each of them to decide what that means. Also, GOP Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> noted, the governor does not have to be guilty of a crime to be convicted in an impeachment trial; <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> can be removed for malfeasance in office. `` There's more than just the guilt or innocence on the charges,'' <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said, adding that he expected senators to be told by the presiding officer that they must `` take action which is in the best interest of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ... based on -LRB- <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s -RRB- ability to continue in office.''

 Leaders of the Palestinian rebellion called Thursday for riots during the visit of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> next week, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prime minister vowed to crush the uprising. Soldiers shot one Palestinian dead, bringing the Arab death toll to at least 124 since violence began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 1.5 million Palestinians live. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier also has been killed. Israeli officials lifted a three-day closure of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as scheduled at 3 a.m. Friday -LRB- 8 p.m. EST Thursday -RRB-, allowing residents to travel out of their towns and villages. A curfew that confined people in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to their homes was also ended at that time. Five-hour nightly curfews imposed before the shutdown were scheduled to continue in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The end of the three-day confinement meant that journalists could travel freely in the territories. Issuance of Leaflet No. 12 from leaders of the rebellion indicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had not removed its leadership despite mass arrests last week of more than 1,000 people, including those <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said were responsible for publishing the leaflets. Arabs known to be involved have said that, if the Israelis caught some of them, other people would be ready to take their places. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told hundreds of cheering Jewish settlers <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would crush the rebellion in the lands it has controlled since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` Some Arabs are going crazy down there. They are trying to harm what we have built,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said at Herodion, site of the biblical King <PERSON> Herod </PERSON>'s palace. `` They say ... this land belongs to the rioters, the killers, the terrorists. But if somebody tries to harm this ... we will break his hand on these rocks.'' Authorities put new restrictions on the 130,000 Arabs of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> but Greek Orthodox Christians, fearing for their safety, decided nonetheless to cancel pre-Easter processions. Soldiers allowed the 650,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to leave their homes for the first time in three days when the army lifted a curfew for five hours. Street clashes between young Arabs and soldiers soon began in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp, and the army restored the curfew at <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. One Palestinian was wounded in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, the radio said. <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said another Arab from <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> was shot in the neck and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said a Palestinian was wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>, soldiers shot an 18-year-old Palestinian dead during several hours of clashes with protesters hurling rocks and bottles, the army said. Mayor <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemaid </PERSON> said <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jundi </PERSON> died of a stomach wound. The latest leaflet, signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, urged `` all the Arab world to block <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' plan and to stop him from killing the uprising.'' It ordered riots Monday through Wednesday of next week to protest the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit and a proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. The secretary of state is to begin a shuttle through the region Sunday. `` We are telling the Arab world, we do n't need money. We are ready to starve. We will never kneel. We are going to die as martyrs,'' the leaflet said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s equally tough declaration at Herodion: `` We will continue to act against the violence until we stamp it out.'' Military jeeps escorted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s car and a busload of journalists through an army roadblock sealing off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Reporters saw six <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, which are outlawed, hanging from power lines. Patriarch <PERSON> Diodorus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> canceled three pre-Easter processions of the Greek Orthodox church because of the violence, said the Rev. <PERSON> Thimoteus </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaritis </PERSON>, church spokesman. He said it was the first cancellation since the 1967 war. <PERSON> Margaritis </PERSON> said only 1,500 pilgrims were expected for the Orthodox Easter on April 10, compared with 10,000 last year. Tourism to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> declined 13 percent in the first week of March compared with the same period of 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> announced his resignation as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador to protest a meeting between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and two Arab-Americans linked to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It was the strongest indication yet of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> displeasure over the meeting last Saturday with the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. In remarks broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said it was `` beyond the pale'' to suggest he could not meet with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> imposed new travel restrictions on Arabs in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, requiring Palestinians aged 16-35 to have special permits for trips to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, ministry spokeswoman <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> <PERSON> Elinson </PERSON> said. She said permits would be issued only for stays of nine months or longer. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the limitations were designed to stop the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from sending couriers into the occupied territories.

 Despite an uncertain outlook, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was set Thursday to try again to persuade <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and Israelis to open negotiations May 1. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made no prediction on how much progress the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan would make in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> during his shuttle diplomacy there next week, but he was cautiously upbeat, particularly about King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` The Jordanians are quite intrigued with this,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` and I look forward to intensive discussions with the king.'' He described the Israelis, meanwhile, as having `` varying views.'' Clearly referring to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would point out that the peace conference he is proposing is not the active authority that is causing objections in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. It simply would set up direct negotiations between the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and Israelis, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> all have neither accepted nor rejected <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal. `` When they are reluctant to say no, it means everybody understands the importance of trying to find a way to peace and security,'' he told reporters aboard his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet. After refueling here, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for Easter observances and meetings with Italian officials. He is shopping for a new home for 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jet fighters that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will expel from the <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> air base near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in 1991. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is a prime candidate, along with <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Then <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Sunday to begin a five-day <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> venture that also will take him to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. It will be <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s second intensive tour of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in a month. During his trip, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also hoped to make headway on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in discussions with Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s director of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> affairs, April <PERSON> Glaspie </PERSON>, already is in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will see <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> next week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and diplomatic sources said the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> leader may be interested in arrangements for a new distribution of power among vying sects in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 12-year-old civil war. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of 21 senators urged <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to refrain from meeting with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, saying his meeting last week with two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> `` sets a dangerous precedent.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met last Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with two university professors who are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliamentary arm. He denied that his meeting violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law which forbids negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying that not all <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> members are also members in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But the senators said they see `` no distinction between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION>.'' The senators said they wished <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> success on his mission and hoped he would be able to meet with Palestinians who are not <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members. An attempt by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to meet with 15 Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied territories during his last trip to the region several weeks ago failed when the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> refused to endorse the meeting and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> did not show up. The mid-March deadline he set for a reply to his plan for negotiations has passed. But impelled by violence on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> _ 123 Palestinian Arabs and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed in less than three months _ <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is determined to keep trying. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials find some hope in the fact that while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have not accepted the plan they also have not rejected it. Only <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has given its endorsement. The plan calls for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conference in April to launch the negotiations. They would open on May 1 and deal with providing some form of self-rule to Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would deal with a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinian Arabs to work an interim arrangement to last three years. Meanwhile, negotiations on an overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute that also would involve <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would begin in December. Primarily because of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s key role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had drawn <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> into the discussions after several years of icy relations, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. But they said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also was taking up with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> the possibility of new arrangements in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where the Syrians have dominated politics. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, meanwhile, may be interested in reducing <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s involvement in the country, said the officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could keep arming Marxist forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as part of a peace agreement, provided the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could maintain supplies to the rebels. `` It would be better to have a moratorium,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said as he launched another overseas trip to pursue peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But, he told reporters aboard a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet en route to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, `` To date, the Soviets have not wanted to do that.'' The issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet military aid to rival forces is the main roadblock to an agreement to end the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after more than eight years. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposed in March to Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that both sides declare a moratorium. It would be in effect while the Soviets withdrew their estimated 120,000 trroops and for three months afterward. The Soviets accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of posing a last-minute obstacle to an agreement. Negotiations between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which were held under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, stalled. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who will go on to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Sunday to begin a five-day <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> shuttle, made it clear he preferred a suspension of Soviet aid to the Marxists and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the resistance group. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has included Stinger missiles that were effective against Soviet aircraft and helicopters. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the overall goal was `` a balanced outcome.'' He said there was nothing in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` that tells us we can not support our friends.'' He said, `` If the Soviets exercise restraint, we are prepared to exercise restraint.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he did not know whether the Soviets would go along with providing equal levels of aid to the two sides. But he stressed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was prepared to guarantee a settlement even while aid kept flowing to the combatants. `` If we have signed the accords and see a need to support our friends, we will be able to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he discussed the idea on the telephone Wednesday with Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and that President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> then called President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` So these things are in place,'' <PERSON> Shnultz </PERSON> said. `` Where we will all come out remains to be seen.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said earlier that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was seeking <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s approval for continued outside aid to the Afghan combatants after Soviet troops are withdrawn. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there has been no indication of approval from the Soviets. Other officials sought to dispel the notion that the Soviets had even indicated a willingness to consider the proposal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, their clients in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the government of neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have been involved for months in U.N.-sponsored efforts to bring about a withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets have agreed in principle to begin the troop withdrawal two months after a settlement is reached and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is eager for such a deal so that millions of Afghan refugees on Pakistani territory can go home. Preventing a final agreement, however, has been a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> stop aiding the Afghan government after Soviet troops depart. Until such aid ceases, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue backing the Afghan rebels, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said. During talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> renewed a plea for what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been calling a `` symmetrical cessation'' of superpower aid to the Afghan combatants. The new proposal, rather than calling for symmetrical cessation of aid, envisions parallel continuation of assistance. `` We now express the policy in terms of ` we will continue aid to the Mujahadeen as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues aid to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government,''' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The basic point to make is that our policy has not changed in the sense that we will not desert the Afghan rebels,'' the spokesman said. `` We will not cut off money to them as long as the Soviets are providing aid.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not explain how the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> language might be more palatable to the Soviets except to say `` there are some negotiating reasons why it could hopefully allow the agreement to be signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and clear the way for a pullout.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` it would go too far,'' to say <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signaled an interest in the proposal last week, although he did not specifically reject the idea. The source said that before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was devised, some administration officials warned against making an agreement to continue aid to the Afghan combatants part of a secret understanding with the Soviets. It would be against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law to sign an Afghan peace accord that required a cutoff of aid to the resistance forces while agreeing privately with the Soviets to continue such assistance, the official said. Asked on Thursday if a decision to continue aid would be part of an open agreement, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` that's always been our stance.''

<HEAD>President Says Troops Fighting ``Grim Battles'' With Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>, in a rare mention of northern Ethopian insurgents, said Thursday his troops are fighting `` grim battles'' against secessionist rebels, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopia </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the first government comment on reports of a new rebel offensive, which resulted in the capture last week of a strategic town and three Soviet officers advising the Ethiopian army. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Tigray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed Thursday it had also captured <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adowa </PERSON>, two historic towns in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Assesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said rebels took the towns Thursday after a three-day battle. <PERSON> Mamo </PERSON> spoke from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. State-owned Radio <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> as saying rebels in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> had launched a `` systematic and highly destructive campaign,'' disrupting transport and communications networks in their regions. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s statement indicated the fighting must be serious. They said there were reports the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leader is preparing a huge counteroffensive against rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> rebel group. It is believed to be the first time <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> has conceded publicly that the rebels, whom the government normally calls `` bandits,'' are in any way effective. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the insurgencies 13 years ago when, with a group of army officers, he dethroned Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> and helped set up a Marxist government. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> made the comments about the rebels in a report to the eighth regular meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> his </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' Party of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. He appealed to Ethiopians to `` rise in unity in the face of this new challenge,'' according to Radio <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The radio gave no further details of <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s speech and it was not clear whether his comments concerned the rebels' claims on <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> and Adowa. <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> is 110 miles south of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s provincial capital, and <LOCATION> Adowa </LOCATION> is 30 miles from <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION>. Eritrean rebels said Sunday they captured the town of <LOCATION> Afabet </LOCATION>, killing or capturing 18,000 Ethiopian troops. The rebels said one Soviet officer was killed and three taken prisoner. Afabet is 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. The rebels claimed to have wiped out three government divisions and captured tanks, weapons and other military equipment worth millions of dollars. There was no way to verify the rebels' claims. But Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> said the figure of 18,000 troops, a third of troops stationed in the north, sounded preposterous. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> confirmed three of its advisers were captured, but said nothing of a fourth officer being killed. Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war Rebels in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> claimed they captured three towns and more than 3,500 government soldiers in March. There is no way to confirm independently such rebel reports, on which the government refuses to comment. The fighting has aggravated relief efforts in the north, the worst-hit drought region of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Most of the 6 to 7 million Ethiopians threatened with starvation this year live in the north. Because of rebel activities, the government often closes roads in the region, cutting off truck convoys. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that a relief convoy reached the town of <LOCATION> Wukro </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, bringing the first major food delivery to the drought-stricken area since January. The emergency shipment of 1,500 metric tons, enough to feed 100,000 people for a month, arrived Sunday, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

 House approval of $ 48 million in humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels and for children injured in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civil war marks the first time in more than five years that lawmakers have been able to set aside partisan divisions on the issue The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 345 to 70 late Wednesday to approve the aid package and send what the chamber's leaders said was a strong signal of support to the rebels and the leftist Sandinista government, which are trying to forge a long-term cease-fire.

<HEAD>Comedy Makes a Rare Appearance Among Best Actor Nominees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Comedy makes a rare appearance in this year's Academy Awards, with stand-up comic <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> vying with four dramatic performers for the prize as best actor Some critics of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>'s seriousness argue that <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> should have been nominated for best actor because of his modern-day <PERSON> Cyrano </PERSON> in `` Roxanne.'' But in a year that saw a number of impressive performances by comedians, only <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> drew the nod for his manic disc jockey in `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON>, the real-life announcer who regaled American troops with jokes and rock' n' roll over the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> service </ORGANIZATION>. The funny side of the role was a breeze for <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and director <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> allowed him free rein. `` Obviously, the radio part offered me a chance to do some open-field running,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had been a comic himself, and he would spark to some of my suggestions and let me go with them. Many of the things in the movie, like the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> impression and playing records at different speeds, happened spontaneously.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' depth of feeling in the later, dramatic scenes of `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' surprised some reviewers. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> studied drama under <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> at the famed <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but even then his comedic side was emerging. One of his teachers chided him: `` You're mimicking people. Where is YOUR voice?'' He soon found it. After a broken romance, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> dropped out of Juilliard and began playing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> comedy clubs. The comic's contenders in the best actor race are thought of as being more dramatic thespians. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was considered for two powerful roles: as the venomous inside trader of `` Wall Street'' and the erring husband of `` Fatal Attraction.'' The actors branch of the Academy decided to nominate him for `` Wall Street.'' `` It was a marvelous role that <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> wrote,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> says. `` I do n't know why he chose me for the part, but he must have seen something in me that even I did n't even know about. `` Playing a heavy is just fantastic; it's so much more fun than being the good guy. I can understand the attraction that -LRB- villains -RRB- have for actors. `` All of us try to be civilized human beings, but deep down inside we have this feeling to tell everything like it is. The part of <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gecco </PERSON> was a wonderful opportunity for this release. After playing moral redeeeming characters and goodie guys, it was a ball.'' Can an actor win an Oscar for a performance in a foreign language? <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> did it in 1961 with `` Two Women.'' Now <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON> stands a chance for his role as the vain Italian aristocrat who pursues a new love to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in `` Dark Eyes.'' <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON> has acted in 116 films, and he still averages three a year. Why does he work so hard at 64? `` Basically, I am an empty person,'' he said. `` When I act I feel complete because I use the personalities of these characters to fill this emptiness. I am also a childish person, and what better way to live life than by traveling to all these countries and getting paid to have fun and act like a fool, no?'' What <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> feels about acting is not publicly known, since he is one of the least interviewed of film stars. Obviously, he is doing something right, since he has been nominated three times in seven films and won the Oscar for `` Kiss of the Spider Woman'' two years ago. His latest nomination came for his portrayal of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Grunick </PERSON>, the handsome but not-too-bright network anchor man in `` Broadcast News.'' Hurt's few interviews have produced somewhat turgid quotes. As he himself explains: `` I have, fortunately or unforunately, skill at going down paths of endless non sequiturs. In a recent Premiere magazine interview, <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> expounded on what he considered the major question of `` Broadcast News.'' `` What is the nature, to put it simply, of romance in our time? What are our motives in wanting to be together? How do we pair up? Who do we mate with, and why do we do it? A lot of us do n't know the answer, a lot of us feel in flux,'' he said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> has also been recently scarce in the media, apparently content to do his work without theorizing about it in public. In 1987, he shone in three roles: as the devil in `` The Witches of Eastwick''; as the Depression bum in `` Ironweed''; as star network anchor in `` Broadcast News.'' He won his ninth nomination for his role as the former big-league ballplayer in `` Ironweed.'' Despite the cynical roles he has played, <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> has maintained that he remains an optimist. In a 1986 interview he remarked: `` I do n't want to do what I accuse other people of doing: not taking the time to smell the roses. Something very wonderful has happened to me. I do n't want the fact that I see this endless din and gloom in the world to make me incapable of expressing something that's quite frankly wonderful. I'm a very fortunate person to be where I am and do what I do.''

 <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> found out that she had been nominated for an Academy Award as supporting actress when a friend called her at 5 a.m. `` Within 15 minutes a television crew was at the house,'' she said. `` I had time to wash my face, and that was about all. I was absolutely flabbergasted.'' The nomination of <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>'s horrendous mother in `` Throw Momma From the Train,'' provided one of the highlights of a race that includes a 60-year veteran of films, the cousin of a presidential candidate, a classic Argentine actress and a young actress who stood her own against a galvanizing performance by <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>. Here is a look at the nominees: <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON> played the Mexican Indian who devoted her life to be the constant companion of a severely handicapped girl in `` Gaby.'' A distinguished theater actress in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, she was forced into exile by the military government of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. After the junta was overthrown, she returned home to star in the Oscar-winning `` The Official Story,'' which dealt with the atrocities of the regime. `` Gaby'' was Miss <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON>'s first film in English. She regrets that the movie has found a limited audience, apparently because people were scared away by its theme. `` It's not a sad movie,'' she says. `` We are not speaking about sadness. We are speaking about people, about seeking freedom. Sometimes people forget that freedom is in the mind.'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> was nominated for the part of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' wife in `` Fatal Attraction.'' Considering the galvanic role afforded <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> as the vengeful other woman, you might think that <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> would have had reservations about her role. `` Not at all,'' she says. `` I always thought that -LRB- the wife -RRB- was a strong and interesting character, and she got to go through an interesting change. That is something you always look for: It's important that a character be different at the end of a script than in the beginning `` She was sexy and vulnerable and strong. An interesting lady. I never felt even remotely that she would be overshadowed.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sothern </PERSON> made her first movie in 1929, according to the record books. After a long and diverse career in films and television, mostly in comedy, she won her first Academy recognition for a serious role in `` The Whales of August.'' Along with co-stars <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gish </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sothern </PERSON> filmed `` The Whales of August'' on a remote <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> island. `` There was no hotel, only a tiny store,'' she recalls. `` We all stayed in private homes; mine was a lobster fisherman's. The weather was murder: beautiful and sunny in the morning, and stormy in the afternoon. `` There was absolutely nothing to do at night. Fortunately, I brought my cook and my poker chips.'' <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has long been a working actress in theater, films and television, but she did n't impress a national audience until `` Moonstruck.'' Her success came at the same time her first cousin, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, sought the Democratic nomination for president. She grew up in a Greek family in which everybody argued politics. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, she worked as a physical therapist to earn enough money to return and study theater arts. Despite her newfound fame, she intends to remain in the theater; she is the artistic director of the Whole Theater in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` I'm not convinced this being a celebrity is going to be long-lived,'' she says cautiously. Fame was also a long time coming for <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>: `` Thirty-nine years later, after everything I've tried to do and everything I've wanted, this has happened What a curious moment. Thank God, thank <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, who directed ` Momma' -RRB-, thank everybody.'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> has more to be thankful for than an Academy nomination. A year and a half ago, she underwent surgery for cancer of the tongue. She apparently has recovered, but reconstruction of her tongue gave her slurred speech. Happily, it fit perfectly into the character of the fierce Momma. The actress admits that she dreamed of an Oscar as a child growing up in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I have a diary in which I wrote about it,'' she said. `` I was a real movie buff when I was a little girl. I read all the fan magazines, and I wrote for autographs and pictures from the stars. I wanted to be an actress from the time my father took me to see ` The Petrified Forest' at the age of 4. `` I fell in love with actors, especially in the romantic films _ <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> <PERSON> Garson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pidgeon </PERSON>. I just loved movies. And now this -LRB- nomination -RRB- has happened. It's unbelievable.

 ORADOUR-SUR-GLANE, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Just after lunch on the warm afternoon of June 10, 1944, the Nazi SS began rounding up people in this prosperous country town and dividing them into groups. Then they tortured, shot and burned them. Historians have long pondered the reasons for the slaughter of 642 children, women and men and the destruction of Oradour-sur-Glane, carried out four days after the Allied invasion of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> in a village with no history of ties to the French Resistance. A new book by a British businessman, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackness </PERSON>, claims to solve the mystery, suggesting that the massacre was a desperate attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to find a lost fortune in gold. Survivors of the massacre and the families of those who died have vowed to stop publication in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of `` <LOCATION> Oradour </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION> and Aftermath,'' already No. 5 on the British bestseller list and scheduled for publication by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this fall. They claim the book warps history and insults the memory of <LOCATION> Oradour </LOCATION>'s `` martyrs.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebras </PERSON>, 62, who says he hid under the bodies of his neighbors to escape Nazi bullets, put it more bluntly. `` Everyone makes money from the name of Oradour-sur-Glane. This must cease.'' <LOCATION> Oradour </LOCATION> has been preserved _ in ruins _ exactly as it was the day the Germans marched off after the slaughter. In 1945 the French government declared the centuries-old village near <LOCATION> Limoges </LOCATION> a national historic site and it has been visited by more than 500,000 people each year. Plaques mark the sheds, cellars and barns where men were shot in the knees, interrogated, then machine gunned and their bodies burned. A cross stands outside the church where women and children huddled in terror for hours listening to gunfire kill their menfolk before the SS came to gun them down and set the sanctuary ablaze. A piece of twisted metal in the corner of the altar was once a baby carriage. A car on the village green rusts where it was parked by the mayor's son. Only 13 people survived. `` My wife lost all her family, her mother, sister, uncle, aunt,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Montaigne </PERSON>, a spokesman for the survivors' association `` She still goes to the ruins because she feels at home there. She sees them all, even though they are dead.'' The new Oradour-sur-Glane, built adjacent to the ruins, has taken decades to recover. `` No one got married here for 20 years and it was only a couple of years ago that we had a wedding in June,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapuelle </PERSON>, mayor of the town since 1959. `` It was 1963 before we had enough youngsters to make a soccer team. `` No wonder people here are upset about this book.'' Mackness' story is full of intrigue and personal adventure involving smuggled gold ingots and a shadowy figure named <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mackness </PERSON> writes that <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> told him that the ingots were a part of more than half a ton of gold that he and a few French Resistance companions seized during a midnight ambush of an SS convoy. According to the book, the only survivors of the ambush were <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>, who buried the treasure by the side of the road, and a German soldier who reported the event. The gold apparently was a sort of floating pension fund for some officers of the 2nd SS Panzer Division, planning to stash it in <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks for after the war, <PERSON> Mackness </PERSON> writes. It goes on to say that following the ambush, SS Maj. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickmann </PERSON> rushed to the scene and, finding nothing and panicking, dashed to <LOCATION> Oradour </LOCATION>, the nearest village. About 10 books have offered different explanations for the slaughter. But all have left questions dangling. Mackness claims to answer many of these, but he seems to be having trouble getting anyone to accept his story because his sources are concealed. <PERSON> Dickmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> are dead. <PERSON> Mackness </PERSON> refuses to divulge the names of his living sources, many of whom, he says, fear prosecution for the massacre. For many historians, <PERSON> Mackness </PERSON>' word is n't enough. `` No historic fact allows me to give this business the least credibility,'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delarue </PERSON>, a French historian, was quoted by the French newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> as saying. But Mackness stands by his story. `` It fits the known historical facts,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` The people in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> who object to my book have n't read it because it has n't been, and may not be, published there.'' In <LOCATION> Oradour </LOCATION>, Mackness is accused of dancing on the graves of the dead. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mackness </PERSON>' ambush never happened, at least not near <LOCATION> Oradour </LOCATION>,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Lapuelle </PERSON>, who added that the villagers want to preserve the simple, brutal truth of the event, so `` this will never happen again.''

 `` I had a brother at Khe Sahn, `` Fightin' off them Viet Cong. `` They're still there. `` He's all gone.'' _ <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> has turned down untold amounts of money for commercial use of his song, `` Born in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'' He gave it to the makers of <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear America: Letters Home from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' for free. Filmmaker <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> edited thousands of feet of archival footage into a backdrop for the letters in this devastating 90-minute documentary, premiering Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>. Besides <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, the soundtrack includes vintage'60s rock from such artists as the Rolling Stones, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON>. The letters are read off-camera by a star-studded cast of voices, including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who all donated their time. At a recent screening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, some members of the audience were so moved by the film they were unable to get out of their seats when it was over. The documentary is based on the book of the same name and plays on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> throughout April. `` Dear America'' is different from other <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> movies in that it is told in the words of the vets themselves in the often strikingly eloquent letters they wrote to loved ones back home: _ A lieutenant who had just seen a soldier lose his leg writes to his brother, `` I've never seen such bravery and guts before and I'm stunned by it. You shoulda seen my men fight. They were going after wounded men no one else would go after. You shoulda seen my brave men.'' _ Writes Army nurse <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Devanter </PERSON>, `` I'm sick of facing, every day, a new bunch of children ripped to pieces. They're just kids _ eighteen, nineteen years old! It stinks! Whole lives ahead of them _ cut off. I'm sick to death of it. I've got to get out of here ...'' Almost all the footage came from the heretofore untapped NBC News archives. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> footage had already been used in several movies, and CBS does not allow outside producers to use its archives. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s library had been closed to filmmakers until <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> bought the network and changed the policy. `` I happened to be at the right place at the right time,'' said <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> said that because <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> shot none of the film, the Academy Awards committee turned down the documentary for Oscar consideration, but <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> plans to put it up for an Emmy. <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> said his interviews with vets from an earlier project convinced him of the importance of the letters, virtually the only link between those in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and `` the world.'' The other link was rock' n' roll. The soundtrack is an'60s treasury. But <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Born in the U.S.A.'' became the anthem of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans' disillusionment and courage in the'80s. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> had allowed the song to be used once before, in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> play `` Tracers,'' produced by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, co-producer of the <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> film. <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> just had to have the song for the ending of `` Dear America.'' `` We went to <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and asked him if we could use it, and he immediately said yes. It did n't take one second for him to say yes. In fact, his comment was, ` It's the vets' song. Of course, you can use it,''' <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> donated the song on the condition that all the music be donated, giving the producers leverage to obtain the other music without cost. The film is structured chronologically and punctuated by stark graphics describing the escalation of the conflict. The combination of music and pictures evokes the era, not just the war. But above it all are the words. <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> knew what he wanted in the reading of the letters _ a delicate balance of emotion that did n't go over the edge into melodrama. He found himself giving direction to the biggest names in acting _ <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, among others. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON> reads the last, most devastating letter, from a mother to a son who died in the conflict 15 years earlier. When <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON> arrived at the studio, <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> said, she brushed him off, insisting brusquely that they just get on with it. `` My heart was sinking,'' he said. `` I was going, oh, God, this woman has a lunch date or something and wants to get out of here, and this is the most crucial letter in the film, and I really blew it, I've picked the wrong person.'' She was not the wrong person. She had been rehearsing the letter on her own and could n't discuss it, she had to just do it. `` That's the only letter that was done in one take,'' <PERSON> Couturie </PERSON> said. `` She went in and just nailed it. It was an awesome performance.''

 Try as they might, Lutherans in this proud mill town ca n't seem to forgive or forget the controversy that shook their church when a mild-mannered pastor added protest to prayer. Sunday after Sunday four years ago, <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> preached against `` corporate evil'' and the moral imperative of helping workers in this economically strapped area. Often the sermons were delivered after he and others burst into services attended by steel industry executives. The protesters put dead fish in safe deposit boxes, and sprayed skunk oil at banks. The protests climaxed in January 1985 when seven of <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s supporters, including his wife, barricaded themselves inside <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in defiance of a court order, only to be routed by sheriff's deputies Now, many of the faithful are back in their pews, worshipping with a new minister. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, now defrocked, conducts Lutheran-style services every Sunday for a smaller flock at a Pentecostal sanctuary across town. The protest group, <ORGANIZATION> Denominational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION>, has changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION> to mimic its main target, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which used to be <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. And the controversy surrounding <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION>'s tactics rumbles on `` This group ca n't back off and say, ` Well, maybe we were wrong. We've caused a lot of heartache and we're sorry,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gahagen </PERSON>, 70, a lay official at the newly organized Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit in what used to be Trinity Lutheran. `` For the ones living here, they'll never get over it,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, 61, the church's new pastor. `` It's not hatred, but it borders on that.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION> supporters take it all in stride. `` They think we're crazy,'' said <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 36, wearing, as always, his clerical collar. `` They know we'll do whatever it takes.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s latest brush with the law came March 4 during <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' visit to a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area jobs center for the unemployed. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION> supporter were arrested while protesting outside, but were cleared of disorderly conduct charges. `` We're upsetting and making all sorts of impact without even having to lift a finger,'' boasted <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON>, 37, another defrocked Lutheran minister and a DMX leader. His brother, actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Soul </PERSON>, periodically has lent his support. Gone are all but a half dozen of the Lutheran pastors who helped organize the church-sponsored ministry in the early 1980s. The group soon charged Pittsburgh-area corporate giants like <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> with abandoning once-prosperous steel towns along the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers. `` This is a small but vocal minority. I think people understand that,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappeler </PERSON>, 56, an official of the <LOCATION> Southwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Synod of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The broad consensus of the Lutheran church is that the church is doing what it can in the areas the <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION> has always professed to be concerned about.'' Gone, too, are the unionists who backed the rebel clergymen's cause `` It became a church battle, that's what happened,'' explained <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisen </PERSON>, 51, a former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> local president. As for <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, he says his defrocking and going on welfare have helped him empathize more with the problems he was protesting and made him more credible among the unemployed. `` There are prices to be paid, particularly in the family,'' said <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a father of four. `` But family is exactly why you do this. How can you look your children in the eyes and say, ` Well, we have to take care of ourselves'? It's very bad theology.'' The unorthodox crusade began in earnest on Easter 1984 when <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION> supporters stormed into an affluent <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> church and railed against `` corporate evil.'' They declared that overseas investments by steelmakers and other businesses were contributing to the area's high jobless rate The next Sunday, and the next and the next, similar disruptions were staged at other churches in this rusting steel mill valley. As the hostilities escalated, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s congregation sought and won his removal. Refusing to leave, he was arrested at Trinity Lutheran's altar in November 1984 and jailed for 112 days for civil contempt of court. Because of the turmoil, the synod's executive board ordered the 60-year-old stone church locked and the 145-member congregation disbanded. <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> arrived in September 1986, and the new parish was organized last October. <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>'s first sermon touched on forgiveness, although he `` did n't beat it to the ground.'' He's since had his own faith and patience sorely tested. He said the words `` Scab Pastor'' have been spray-painted on church property, glue has been squeezed into door locks, a stained glass window was shattered by a rock, and an outside gas meter mysteriously was turned off one bitterly cold night. `` I was prepared for a lot worse than has happened,'' <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said. `` I brainwashed myself before I came here that I was not going to let their nonsense get to me.'' While the <ORGANIZATION> DMX </ORGANIZATION> has not claimed responsibility for the vandalism, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> acknowledged `` people are still upset that this abomination of church is there. They're just reacting to the removal of this valid ministry.'' He's appealing the synod executive board's decision to declare the congregation defunct. He's also appealing two jail sentences that are pending as a result of past protests. `` I will be back as an ordained pastor. I will be at Trinity without a doubt,'' he said, nodding emphatically. `` It's just a matter of how much more do they want to lose before I win.''

 Retarded men and women around the nation are being shown an explicit videotape about sex in hopes it will help keep them safe from AIDS. The video uses startling illustrations _ including still photographs of surrogates in specific sexual positions. `` You ca n't generalize or use words. They do n't know what you're talking about,'' explained <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, program director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cerebral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, which will present the video at 12 group homes `` Their ability to abstract information is impaired,'' added <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Porper </PERSON>, a public health educator from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> who appears in the film. `` You have to deal absolutely in black and white, with no grays, and it has to be reiterated in several ways, preferably multi-sensory.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the non-profit agency that created the 17-minute video, with help from the city health department, acknowledges the idea offends some people. `` Someone called from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and said, ` How dare you put homosexuals on the tape?''' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samowitz </PERSON>, the institute's training director `` We do n't want to come across as crazy liberals from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who are promoting promiscuity. But what are the alternatives? We do n't want our clients to die _ no matter who gives us flak.'' The main goal is `` to make sure a condom is worn'' if a retarded adult decides to have sex, <PERSON> Samowitz </PERSON> said. For <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, who has Down's syndrome and lives with 14 other mildly retarded people in their 20s and 30s at a suburban <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> apartment building, talking about AIDS is scary. But after she saw the video, she said, `` I tried to urge that -LRB- condom use -RRB- to a friend at the workshop.'' `` There are times I do n't really want to talk about it or think about it,'' agreed fellow resident <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigman </PERSON>. `` It's kind of painful, but it's better to learn all about it. AIDS kills.'' No statistics indicate how many AIDS victims are retarded, according to <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Porper </PERSON> said she knew of eight AIDS cases among the retarded in the metropolitan area, and a retarded New Yorker died last year of AIDS contracted through a blood transfusion, according to <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganim </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Developmental Disabilities. The risk of AIDS is no less real for the retarded. And so the film is explicit. In one photograph, male surrogates are positioned as if they were about to engage in anal sex so viewers can understand the link between that practice and AIDS. Oral sex and the use of condoms in heterosexual intercourse are also illustrated. `` I'm sure we'll get one or two people who will go bananas about it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. `` A small proportion of people do not believe that their children, whether adults or not, have a right to be active or have knowledge of sexual activity.'' `` I do n't dare bring it up with my parents,'' said <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Colpoys </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> group home. `` My parents talk a lot about that kind of thing. They warn me about what could happen to me,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. `` I say, ` Ma, please _ I can take care of myself. I care about myself.''' Teachers stress in group discussions that the film is not intended to advocate any act, and that abstinence is acceptable. Role-playing is included to help participants refuse unsafe sex. `` It teaches them how to be sensitive and relate to people in a caring, responsible way,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> YAI </ORGANIZATION>, which runs 50 programs for the retarded in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, including 24 group homes. Group home residents also practice putting condoms on a plastic penis and are told to use condoms themselves, even when it's not clear where a romantic moment will lead. `` The mildly and moderately retarded know their judgment is impaired,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Porper </PERSON>. `` If you give them a choice they are incapable of making _ like when to put on a condom _ it raises tremendous anxieties in them.'' Some professionals have qualms about the film's approach. `` I think the general feeling of our staff is that it was too negative, too scary,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, prevention specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Developmental Disabilities. YAI sent the tape to 150 agencies, and the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> council was among five that returned it, said <PERSON> Samowitz </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- the filmmakers -RRB- see this as a very serious issue and their intent is to make people aware of it by scaring them. We're concerned about that approach,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> It also concerns <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> group home resident <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintzer </PERSON>. She and her boyfriend understand safe sex, but can not use condoms because of poor hand coordination _ a problem for some retarded people. `` It's hard to talk about because it's scary,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mintzer </PERSON>, who adamantly refused to see the film a second time. `` Sometimes, denial is an easier way of dealing with scary feelings,'' the residential supervisor, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, told others in the group. `` But I do n't feel it's healthy.'' Some members of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> council also were bothered by the film's explicit nature or felt that it `` left some questions that might confuse people,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>. They agree the retarded need AIDS education, she said. `` But it's not like there's a canned program that works for everybody. Agencies have different perspectives, and communities have different attitudes.'' The film is out of the question for Roman Catholic programs for the retarded because of religious doctrine against condoms and premarital sex, said Monsignor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, director of health and hospitals for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archdiocese </LOCATION>. `` We'd be against it purely from the medical point of view,'' said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>. `` Condoms fail. If we relied solely on condoms, we'd have every darn one of the females pregnant. Instead, abstinence is taught to the 350 retarded adults served through archdiocese programs. `` It's just a reinforcement of what we've been doing all along,'' said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ganim </PERSON>, the spokesman for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mental health office, felt ambivalent about the film. `` I certainly know it's explicit and some people have expressed concerns about that,'' he said. `` But by and large, what we have heard back about the tape has been positive. They've brought up the fact that there is a need for this kind of thing.'' Dr. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Special Projects, said no one has studied what kind of AIDS information is available for the retarded and what might be effective. <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> guidelines issued in January suggested that schools address the issue of AIDS education for the disabled. `` We need to think about it,'' said <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON>. `` The questions, I think, are important ones.'' `` It's not like you should just forget about it and pretend AIDS does n't exist,'' said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a resident at the group home. `` A woman has to be prepared.''

<HEAD>With AM-R Is for Ritalin I</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CANTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> was a sullen, introverted boy, fascinated with death, obsessed with fire. <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON> was outgoing and happy; he played hockey and talked of counseling troubled youths. Sixteen months ago <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON> to death with a baseball bat. Last month the 15-year-old was found guilty of second-degree murder and given life in prison. The horrible crime was n't the only link between murderer and victim. Both took Ritalin, a stimulant used to calm hyperactive children. And while the trial served as a stage to the debate over the drug, it also provided testimony on how Ritalin, in combination with other treatment, can help children, and how its casual use can allow deeper problems to go undetected. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, claimed the drug nudged the boy into the madness it took to plan and commit murder. The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-psychiatry group connected with the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION>, trumpeted the case as an example of the dangers it associates with the drug. A stream of psychiatrists and psychologists gave offsetting testimony. Defense witnesses said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> was psychotic, that the Ritalin `` enhanced'' his obsession to kill. Prosecution witnesses said the boy's emotional problems were not enough to obscure his notion of right and wrong. Ritalin, they said, played no factor. Ironically, <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Ritalin </PERSON> helped her son, calming him enough to allow the counseling and therapy that taught him how to control himself. Guidelines by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> say Ritalin should be prescribed after detailed diagnosis and used only in combination with counseling and careful monitoring. According to testimony, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> received Ritalin without other therapy. His mother, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>, portrayed him as a quiet child who said little more than yes or no in his early years. When he became a behavioral problem in the third grade, a pediatrican prescribed Ritalin. Mrs. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said there were no special psychological or physical tests, no monitoring of her son's progress over the next five years. Mrs. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said her son went off the drug a few months before the killing, then asked for more pills a few weeks later. A bottle of Ritalin was found in his school locker; no one knows if he was taking the drug at the time of the killing. In contrast, Mrs. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said her son `` went through all kinds of tests'' before he was diagnosed as hyperactive and given Ritalin at age 7. She said she attended sessions for parents with hyperactive children, watched her son's diet and diverted his energies into activities like hockey and bicycling. After four years, <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON> was weaned from the drug. `` We had taught him to learn self-discipline and self-control,'' she said. White said the effect Ritalin had on his client remains a mystery, but he believes that reliance on the drug, instead of testing and therapy, played a role in the tragedy. `` The whole affair was a lost opportunity to spot a potential problem,'' he said. `` As a result, we've got one boy in prison and another boy dead.''

 One hyperactive student is greatly helped by Ritalin, so the teacher encourages the parents of others to try it _ and they tell other parents about the happy results. Ritalin's success many have led to its excess: some fear it's now overused The second story in a three-day series, ` R' is for Ritalin, looks at the increased role of a prescribed drug in the nation's schools.

 Something new is tucked amid the workbooks, pencils and sandwiches in an increasing number of school backpacks each day. It is a pill, no bigger than button candy, prescribed to help youngsters get through their multiplication tables, spelling tests and geography lessons. The pill is Ritalin, a stimulant that can assist hyperactive children in concentrating, completing their work and controlling frenzied outbursts that turn classrooms to chaos. Some parents describe Ritalin as a godsend. `` It was like the difference between day and night,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, mother whose daughter, 11, and son, 8, take the drug. `` The first day <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> took Ritalin was the first time she was able to read something and understand it. That night she told me and started crying. `` I cried, too.'' But Ritalin's success may be leading to its excess. As many as 1 million children may take the drug, and happy endings like the <ORGANIZATION> Andersons </ORGANIZATION>' are encouraging more doctors to prescribe it, sometimes with less triumphant results. Many doctors say superficial diagnosis and limited follow-up have led to the medicating of the children who do n't need it, or who need additional counseling to learn how to tame the confusion inside their minds. `` I know of several communities and school districts where people are excessively prescribing medication for children without adequately evaluating them,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkely </PERSON>, director of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barkely </PERSON> said these communities to the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> and north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> `` may be seeing the children once a year and renewing the prescription by telephone.'' The five states with the highest per-capita consumption of Ritalin _ <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> _ have begun investigating its use. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> officials alarmed by high Ritalin use in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> found school personnel were urging Ritalin treatment on parents. `` We looked at what was driving the marketplace and wound up with the conclusion that it was the school systems,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Watry </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Composite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiners </ORGANIZATION>. `` Parents were calling us with a lot of anecdotal information about how their arms were twisted to take the medication.'' <PERSON> LaVarne </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> mother, believes Ritalin is used as a chemical billy club to subdue problem students. She has filed suit against the doctor and school officials who encouraged her to medicate her son. `` It's almost like someone said we've got a pill to give a child who wo n't do what you want him to do,'' she said. When <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, had trouble in first-grade at <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, she sought medical help on the school's advice. Her pediatrian prescribed Ritalin. But <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> did not improve and, according to his mother, suffered from insomnia, depression and a loss of appetite. Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> finally took <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> to a neurologist who found the boy's problems were due to a hemiparesis, a limited brain injury not treatable by Ritalin The Marshalls are suing the pediatrician. `` He simply prescribed Ritalin,'' she said. `` We were not given a diagnosis.'' Parents like Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> claim Ritalin carries harsh side effects, from facial tics and lost appetite to depression and suicide. Their anxieties are fed by the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> _ a group, supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION>, that opposes psychiatric treatment and is conducting a nationwide media campaign against Ritalin. Doctors and government regulators dismiss most charges against <PERSON> Ritalin </PERSON> as exaggerated and unsubstantiated, citing some 500 research papers that mostly agree side effects are temporary and minimal. Manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and known generically as methylphenidate, Ritalin is one in a small group of drugs used to treat childhood behavioral disorders and narcolepsy. As a Class II drug, it is listed, along with amphetamines, morphine and the painkiller Demerol, as a drug with legitimate use but high potential for abuse. Prescribing drugs for problem children is not new. The Roman physican <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> suggested opium for overactive children in the first century. Research in the 1930s indicated that treating hyperactive children with stimulants, usually amphetamines, helped calm them. Ritalin was developed in 1955 as an alternative to amphetamines. What has changed in the last decade is the awareness _ some say overawareness _ of the malady that Ritalin is used to treat. Known variously over years as hyperactivity, hyperkinesis and minimal brain disfunction, the syndrome is now called attention deficit disorder, a catch-all of symptoms ranging from wild, destructive behavior to an inability to concentrate or, in educational jargon, `` stay on task.'' Researchers say 3 to 10 percent of the nation's 45 million schoolchildren exhibit some symptoms of ADD. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s diagnostic bible lists ADD symptoms such as fidgeting, difficulty awaiting turns at games, blurting out answers before being called on, excessive talking and a penchant for losing things. While many parents would recognize some of these noisome habits in their children, ADD parents say it is the intensity of the behavior that separates theirs from normal children. `` It's the constantness of it,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, mother who publishes a newsletter for ADD families. `` You are trapped in it. You ca n't take these children anywhere, you ca n't get babysitters to stay with them. It is so emotionally tough to get through this day by day.'' ADD is the single most researched area of child psychology. Some 600 research papers on the subject were published last year. ADD seminars are commonly held around the country for doctors, educators and parents. Regional diagnostic clinics have sprung up, often near research centers in states with high Ritalin use. As a result, more and more children are being diagnosed with ADD and treated with medication. Critics note with alarm that Ritalin production has doubled since 1983. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which sets production levels, says that statistic sheds little light on how many people take a drug. A better gauge is number of prescriptions. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> report shows 2.2 million prescriptions for Ritalin and related drugs were filled and refilled in 1986. The figure does not show the number of people using the drug, but it does indicate an increase in use _ the number is 14 percent higher than in 1983. `` That's unusual,'' said <PERSON> Carlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> psychologist. `` The average annual increase in prescriptions for most drugs is 1 percent.'' No one is certain how many of the nation's children get a daily dose of Ritalin. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Safer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> child psychiatrist who has studied surveys at various school districts, believes 600,000 to 800,000 schoolchildren receive stimulant medication, mostly Ritalin. `` It's been going up steadily,'' said Safer, `` and I do n't see it going down.''

 In 1971, 1.1 percent of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school students were taking Ritalin, <PERSON> Safer </PERSON> said. By 1983, the number was up to 3.5 percent. `` The increase is a multiple of factors: parent-teacher satisfaction, the ease of treatment and its relative success,'' he said. Most Maryland school districts recommend parents seek medical help only after teachers, counselors and administrators have met to discuss a problem student. `` We do n't prescribe Ritalin,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubel </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. `` All we do is refer children to medical help, the same as we would if a child had problems seeing a blackboard. We would tell the parents and they would have the child's eyes examined.'' Yet when <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials, threatened with a lawsuit, reviewed their policy late last year, they found such a measured response was not always the case. `` I am convinced that we probably do have some people out there who sidestep some of the procedures and say ` You have to get that child on Ritalin,''' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, an assistant county attorney. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Watry </PERSON>, the director of the medical examiners' board, tells of one school counselor who would `` pressure parents on a mass scale to use Ritalin.'' `` He told parents he was playing the percentages because it had helped with so many cases,'' said <PERSON> Watry </PERSON>. Late last year a special study group for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> recommended school personnel be warned against `` pressuring'' parents to seek medication and leave diagnosis and treatment to medical professionals. But often these professionals are not doing a complete job. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends extensive testing and discussion among doctors, parents and educators before prescribing medication. Guidelines also stress that medication is only part of the solution. Counseling, therapy, tutoring, even special classes for parents are recommended. `` Almost everybody in the field will say you have to do more than give the pill,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> psychiatrist whose research found hyperactive children responded dramatically better to a combination of therapy and Ritalin. `` We've heard about pediatricians who have said, ` Here's six months of prescription, come back when it runs out,''' he said. `` That gives a message to parents that here's this magic pill, you do n't need any other treatment.'' But some question if many of those getting treatment need it. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a psychologist and director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, believes doctors choose medication when counseling and different parenting might be enough. `` We have created a society that relies on medication to solve our problems,'' he said. `` The first thing you go to when you have a problem is some kind of pill.''

<TEXT>
 Each weekday morning our 7-year-old son <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> starts breakfast with a tiny white tablet he calls his `` daydream pill.'' The pill has become part of our daily routine. There was a time when my wife and I, people who think twice before taking aspirin, would have been incredulous had you told us we'd be giving our child a behavior-modifying drug. As <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> grew into an active toddler, he gave no indication anything was amiss; we were sure he was a superstar. With blond curls and a sturdy well-coordinated body, he was quick and good at everything: an early walker and talker, a cheerful elf full of eager questions. But by the time <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was ready for kindergarten, we were concerned. He could n't seem to keep his mind on a task. He did n't like to play alone, and he did n't stay with an activity for more than a few minutes We hoped it was just immaturity. Perhaps we had spoiled him? With his quick mind and pleasing personality, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> drifted through kindergarten. We wondered why he was n't picking up academic skills as quickly as we'd anticipated, but his school reports were generally good and he was having a good year with soccer and T-ball. Everything changed in first grade. He was one of 30 classmates, and most of the school day required independent seatwork. We realized something was very wrong when <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> began collapsing into tantrums of free-floating rage and frustration after school. We were completely taken aback, especially because we had high confidence in his small, caring school. We were mystified by our little soccer player's rage. At what? Was it the oversized class? The school principal assured us that, although the class was large, the children were doing fine. We spoke to psychologist friends about whether some deep-seated anxiety could be surfacing. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> himself was unable to give us any clues until one night in the midst of an emotional collapse, he said, over and over, `` I'm dumb. Fortunately for us all, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s class took a group intelligence test about this time. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s score was so high in comparison with his performance that the principal called us in. She wanted to do further testing and mentioned `` attention deficit,'' a term that seemed to fit the child we knew. The principal also mentioned Ritalin, saying she had seen dramatic changes in kids like <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. We were appalled by the suggestion we give our boy a drug, skeptical that this was the proper way to approach a learning problem. Instead, we tried a highly publicized diet and spent an agonizing month keeping <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> from many of his favorite foods, ones with cyclamates and additives. The stress of the diet increased <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s rage and frustration. We next urged the school to institute behavioral techniques, such as rewarding <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> for even brief periods of concentration. These helped, but only moderately, and we started to reconsider. After reading all the research we could find, and considering the side effects -LRB- such as the possibility <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> would be one-quarter inch shorter as an adult -RRB-, we concluded the risks of trying Ritalin were minimal. A factor in our decision was our own dependence on our morning cups of coffee, which help us get going and stay focused. Were we depriving <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> of the equivalent of a morning cup of coffee? The pediatrician said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> might temporarily lose his appetite or have trouble sleeping. None of this happened, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was surpringly amenable to taking the tiny pill. Indeed, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was the first to let us know it was making some difference. He started calling it his `` daydream pill,'' saying it helped him control the daydreams that distracted him in class. His teacher soon reported his behavior was improving, and we saw this reflected in his school work. Still, we could n't be certain it was n't just a placebo effect on <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and the teacher. This year, with a new teacher who shared our lingering reservations, we withheld the Ritalin for a couple of weeks. Simultaneously, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and his teacher reported he could n't concentrate and urged us to return to the pill With the increased demands of second grade, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> has begun taking an additional 5 milligrams at lunch. Occasionally, when he's having trouble staying with his homework, he'll say, `` Maybe I should take a pill.'' Last week we filled yet another prescription at the pharmacy where we are now recognized as regulars. Last month, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> proudly brought home a report card with B's in math and English and A's _ his first ever _ in reading and spelling. In categories such as deportment, handwriting and follows directions, which last year produced a string of F's for failure and N's for non-satisfactory, there were 2 N's and 13 S's _ for satisfactory. Is Ritalin a panacea? No. Even with the pill, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s attention deficit still requires the guidance of a skillful teacher. Are we comfortable about him taking medicine? Yes and no. We like the results but are uncomfortable treating a symptom, the cause of which no one knows. We are especially uncomfortable that the psychologists and doctors seem unconcerned why <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> has trouble paying attention. Will we keep giving him the pill? Yes, at least while <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> thinks it's helpful. We'll also keep trying to find a deeper understanding of what's involved. As <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> says, `` It's not perfect, but it works, some.''

<HEAD>Parents Beware: Diagnosing ADD Difficult, Treatment Complex</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-R Is for Ritalin II</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 For parents facing a decision on whether to medicate a child with Ritalin, psychiatrists and pediatricians offer some advice: Make sure the diagnosis is made carefully and the treatment involves more than just taking pills. Ritalin is commonly prescribed for hyperactive children with attention deficit disorder, but too often they are diagnosed without proper testing and evaluation, they say. And if a treatment does not include counseling and educational therapies, it probably is faulty, the experts add. `` I think there are children given the drug who do not have ADD,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> and Adolescent Psychiatry. `` And if they do, drugs alone are not going to resolve that. Very often mistakes are made of making the diagnosis and then only prescribing the drug.'' Parents, <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said, should expect five things of their physician: _ A complete and thorough diagnosis. _ Information about possible side effects. _ Close monitoring of the effects of medication through regular visits. _ Information about alternative treatments. _ An explanation of the consequences if medication is not used. `` If the physician does not do these things, parents have every reason ... to seek medical help elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s Diagnostic and <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION> says an ADD diagnosis must include signs of inattention and impulsivity, as well as onset before age 7 and duration of at least six months. Other disorders must be ruled out. An ADD study group appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> called ADD `` one of the most time-consuming of the disorders of childhood to evaluate.'' Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, child hyperactivity expert, said he spends two hours taking history and 10 hours testing before making an ADD diagnosis. `` When you see <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> staring out the window or bouncing off the walls, you do n't know if he's off-task because of a brain filter problem -LRB- treatable with Ritalin -RRB-, a learning disability or a behavioral problem,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. Once an ADD diagnosis is made, experts say, too often the child is treated only with medications such as Ritalin _ the prescribed way to go until as recently as 1970. The latest research shows that a more effective treatment combines medication with therapy and counseling. `` Everyone agrees that you have to do something more than give a pill,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who pioneered some ADD research. `` In the real world, most of the children get one treatment, seldom two, never three _ and the most common would be medication.''

 Daily doses of the drug Ritalin are increasingly the treatment of choice for children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. Not surprisingly, more and more clinics are specializing in such diagnosis and treatment. And schools are often enthusiastic about Ritalin's success. Two stories offer inside looks at one such clinic, where an 11-year-old girl learned she would begin what might be years of Ritalin therapy, and at a school where teachers credit Ritalin with helping children conquer their emotional and academic despair. A third story looks at <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the state with the youngest population, a reputation for moral conservatism _ and the highest per capita use of Ritalin in the nation.

 Her school principal had urged her mother to make the four-hour drive from rural northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Now 11-year-old <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> sat in a tiny, windowless office where a psychologist peppered her with questions. The morning would end with doctors at the Attention Deficit Disorder Clinic of Children's Hospital telling <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> her baffling problems at home and in school would mean treatment with the stimulant Ritalin, quite likely for years. But first doctors tested Chrissie: spelling tests, math tests, reading tests, questions about her family life. They probed her moods, whether she ever felt like committing suicide -LRB- `` once or twice,'' she said. -RRB- They examined her school grades, read reports from teachers. They even had <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>, a sliver-thin, pretty girl with straight blond hair, draw a picture of herself. The 2-inch-high sketch spoke volumes to the psychologist about the youngster's poor self-image. Finally the psychologist asked <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> for three wishes. `` A horse ranch,'' the girl said after several moments. `` A happy life. And people who care who can help me through this tough time. `` I have n't really been happy since I was 2 or so. I yell at my parents. Later I wish I had n't done it. They're very good to me. So I have n't had a very happy life.'' <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>, which is not the girl's real name, indeed had many problems, the doctors concluded. But she hardly fit the popular, often mistaken, stereotype of children who take Ritalin. First, boys are eight times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as having ADD. Second, <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> was n't `` bouncing off the walls.'' In fact, many youngsters recommended for Ritalin treatment are not discipline problems and appear calm in most situations. <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>, said psychologist <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, is `` a classic case of a kid whose ADD was not caught as a young kid.'' Pre-adolescents and teen-agers who unexplainedly struggle with school for years often arrive at ADD clinics deeply depressed as a result of their attention problems. The key was her inability to complete tasks and concentrate. Tests suggested she was weak in math, easily frustrated, dangerously depressed, and had a poor self-image. <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> knows she has troubles. `` I have quite a problem paying attention in school. I've had it since kindergarten,'' she told a visitor in a brief break from testing. `` I sometimes just have to get out of my seat. I go to the drinking fountain, and I'm not even thirsty. It's weird. `` If I have a problem, I'd really like to know about it.'' Fewer than 100 such ADD clinics operate around the country, according to <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a psychologist who heads one at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Nearly all start with the assumption that ADD is essentially a physiological disease that in most cases can be treated chemically Some clinics simply juggle prescriptions, using placebos and Ritalin or other stimulant drugs alternately to find the most effective treatment. They leave the followup and monitoring to others, often the family pediatrician. Others, like the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> clinic, employ pediatricians, psychologists and social workers to look at the child in totality. That means that counseling and changes in lessons or surroundings are often part of the treatment. But at the heart of these clinics is the conviction that Ritalin therapy helps most patients. Since it opened in September 1986, the ADD Clinic here has examined some 600 patients and has a three-month waiting list, said Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>, a pediatrician and co-director of the clinic. At least three-quarters were diagnosed as having ADD, and about 85 percent of those were placed on medication, usually Ritalin. Once treatment begins, doctors rely on teacher questionnaires, report cards and parents to monitor whether Ritalin is helping the child in school and whether it is having side effects. <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>'s teacher wrote this description of her on a Conners Questionnaire, the standardized form used to evaluate children suspected of having attention deficit disorder: `` <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> is not a behavior problem,'' her teacher wrote. `` I just do not have her attention 90 percent of the time. ... On the day we had our first bit of snow last fall, I was trying to help her understand something. She looked at me and smiled, saying ` I wonder what my kitten thinks of snow? She never saw it before.' Sometimes it seems her mind is way off somewhere else.'' <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> and her mother sat expressionless as the doctors later told them that Ritalin and psychological counseling `` should make a difference.'' Her mother expressed mild surprise over the prescription. `` Ritalin has a bad name,'' she said after the doctors had left the room. `` I was somewhat surprised because I associated Ritalin with hyperactivity.'' How is <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> doing? After six weeks of Ritalin and counseling, <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON>'s teachers told doctors she had shown mild improvement in attention span and a marked improvement in her ability to sit still and stick to school work.

 One of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>'s pupils takes the drug Ritalin to calm his hyperactivity and help him pay attention. She challenged a visitor to guess who. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> was the obvious choice. Seated with three other boys at a semicircular desk in a special education class at <ORGANIZATION> Scotch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the third-grader fidgeted in his chair, got up several times to sharpen his pencil, drummed his fingers, asked questions repeatedly and never seemed to hear the answers. The guess was wrong. Instead, the child on Ritalin was a slender boy with flaming red hair who calmly sailed through a reading comprehension quiz and listened attentively to a lesson on homonyms. <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> says he's doing so well he probably will leave handicapped classes forever in the fall. At Scotch Elementary, they believe in <LOCATION> Ritalin </LOCATION> _ and teachers point to cases like these to vindicate their faith in the controversial drug. Far from thinking Ritalin creates passive `` zombies,'' as some critics have charged, teachers and parents alike in this affluent northwest <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb seem convinced of Ritalin's track record for turning emotional and academic despair into success. Grades and attention span often improve, and some youngsters who might have spent entire school careers isolated in classes for the disabled have managed to rejoin their regular peers with the help of the drug. Most of all, teachers like <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> resent the assertion by some that Ritalin is merely a cynical way for schools to silence problem children while claiming they are trying to help them. `` I read that this is the way we treat kids we ca n't handle. It's not true. It's just not true,'' said <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, whose daughter has taken the drug for four years. While an estimated 1-2 percent of the nation's 40 million schoolchildren take Ritalin, Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wender </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> psychiatrist and author of several books on attention deficit disorder, or ADD, believes 3-to-10 percent of all children have hyperactivity problems. At Scotch Elementary, approximately 5 percent of the 550 pupils drop by principal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>'s office each day to take a pill. Several elements help explain why Ritalin is commonplace at Scotch Elementary; teachers and school administrators have attended seminars and taken other training to recognize symptoms of ADD. Area doctors are not only willing to prescribe Ritalin but also to work with teachers and schools to monitor its success. And parents generally seem to accept the professionalism, good faith and judgment of the teachers and doctors. `` When you first start talking to parents about this, they're devastated,'' said principal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> `` Then 90 percent react that it is a medical problem.'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> tells of a youngster named <PERSON> George </PERSON> who has taken Ritalin for two years. He had been assigned to a `` resource room,'' where handicapped children get individual instruction for part of each day. `` He had an incident every day of losing his temper, punching someone or screaming in vile terms,'' said <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>. `` Now he's out of special education He's a winner.'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, like other educators, insists `` we never recommend medication.'' But that's only partly true. If the school's psychologist, social worker or reading specialist believes a child has ADD, they know which doctors will nearly always prescribe Ritalin At the top of the list is Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, a pediatrician who operates the <ORGANIZATION> Attention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deficit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Schools from all over <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> recommend her, and prospective patients often wait 6-8 weeks for an appointment She now treats 1,500 youngsters for ADD, some as young as 3. Almost invariably, she prescribes Ritalin or similar medication. `` I work magic with the medicine,'' she said in an interview in her office. `` I'm willing to try things. `` We're talking about large numbers of kids who are getting a bum steer in life, from kindergarten on. Some look like couch potatoes. They do n't all look alike,'' she said. But even Ritalin's advocates admit it is n't always well-monitored. Teachers are supposed to provide crucial information enabling doctors to set the right dosage, or to determine if drugs are necessary at all to academic success. Such monitoring is frequent when medication first begins. After that, `` there really is n't that much to do unless there's a problem,'' the doctor said. <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and other ADD specialists typically send teachers questionnaires to fill out for the first 2-4 weeks of medication, then gradually less frequently until `` we feel we're on a steady course. At a certain point we step out of the picture unless the teacher notices a problem.'' Still, Ritalin remains a `` last resort,'' said <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>. Teachers might, for example, put distractible children in study carrels _ desks with three sides blocked off so the child ca n't see in front or to either side. But when `` we've exhausted all those things ... logged the classroom observations,'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said, `` we would just as soon get a recommendation to try something else.''

 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is a state of large, close-knit families whose religion frowns on the use of liquor and caffeine. It is also a state with the nation's largest appetite for the stimulant drug Ritalin. The <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said that in 1986 pharmacies along the state's <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> received 25,000 grams of the drug used for hyperactive children, or 1,558 grams for every 100,000 population. That figure compares to 1,218 grams per 100,000 residents of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, the next highest Ritalin state. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the figure was 347 grams per 100,000. The reasons for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s high use of Ritalin are many. They may point the way for the future in other parts of the country. `` What we are doing here is, in some ways, ahead of many parts of the country,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wender </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has the youngest population of any state, with nearly a quarter of its residents aged 5 to 17. It also leads the nation in the size of individual families, about 4.3 children per household. Consequently it has the nation's most crowded classrooms with 24.6 students per teacher. Although <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> ranks near the top of the list in the amount of state money, 47 percent, going to education, it is last in per capita spending on education, at $ 2,372 per student. So when the fragile balance in these overcrowded classrooms is threatened by disruptive children, `` the pressures on parents and teachers are going to lead people to look for solutions ... and one of the solutions is medication,'' said <PERSON> Stevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukic </PERSON>, state director of special education. In the <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, an estimated 2 percent of the 60,000 students receive Ritalin or one of its cousins for attention deficit disorder, a syndrome that includes hyperactive as well as inattentive pupils. `` It is becoming more acceptable in the parents' minds and the teachers' minds,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a special education teacher whose son takes Ritalin. `` When the teachers see the dramatic effect it can have on problem students, they want them medicated so they can learn.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a psychologist who saw 100 ADD children at his clinic last year, estimates a quarter of his patients are referred by the schools. Another 25 percent come at the suggestion of other parents whose children take Ritalin. Half his patients were sent by pediatricans. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s medical community also contributes to Ritalin use. Reseachers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> are considered leaders in ADD study. Their philosophies are passed on to their students, many of whom later set up practice nearby. As a result, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> has three clinics that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of ADD children _ many larger cities across the country have none. Psychologists, psychiatrists and pediatricians share information and refer patients for treatment. `` In a community this size it is easier to make an impact with an idea, especially an idea that appeals to people,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. Parents of ADD children describe their successes with Ritalin as more than appealing. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> cries when she talks about the effect Ritalin has had on her 11-year-old son, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>. `` There has been such a remarkable change in this child,'' she said. `` From the time he was 7 he talked about suicide. Now he's on the student council and is so thrilled with life.'' Mrs. Miner has joined others in a local support group for ADD parents. The gatherings can be emotional: laughter about the bruises and stitches their children have collected while rocketing around the house, tears as they talk about the difference treatment has brought. `` I wanted to share the knowledge with other families,'' said the group's founder, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Steineckert </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 11, has taken Ritalin for more than a year. `` It is very traumatic to put a child on drugs, but if you have a good experience, you're converted,'' she said

 Fifteen years since six members of the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family were murdered on their farm, shock has turned to bitter impatience as retrials of three defendants threaten to take the case into the next decade. The retrials, ordered despite what a federal court called obvious guilt, have burdened tiny, rural <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Tucked into <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s southwest corner and with just 9,500 people, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has about $ 1 million a year to spend. The cost of the appeals is expected to exceed $ 600,000. Other counties are holding the retrials, but they send their bills to <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION>, the site of the murders. The second retrial, of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 41, starts Monday in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>. Judicial juggling replaced questions of guilt or innocence years ago, and that rankles here, where concepts of right and wrong are stark and pure. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, 62, his brother <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON>, 57, and sons <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, 35, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, 25, were shot to death in <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s trailer as they arrived singly or in pairs May 14, 1973. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, 26, was raped there, driven to a field six miles away, raped and sodomized again and shot twice in the back. Their graves, marked by a $ 20,000 black marble slab, lie near a cedar tree planted more than a century ago at <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>. An irrigation well stands on the site of the trailer 12 miles from <LOCATION> Donalsonville </LOCATION>. But faded `` Remember The Aldays'' stickers remain on a few vehicles, and in the local courthouse is a cartoon depicting the appellate judges who overturned the convictions as the Three Stooges. `` Remember them in May during ` Respect For Law Week,''' reads the caption. `` There wo n't be justice for the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family until -LRB- the killers -RRB- all fry,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gail </PERSON>, nursing a soft drink at the local pool hall. `` The court found them guilty, they know they're guilty, and that should be the end of it. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, then 26 years old, his half-brother <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON>, 35,, all escapees from a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison farm, were arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shortly after the killings. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>'s wristwatch was in <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON>'s pocket. The men had three of the weapons used to kill the Aldays. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s confession was read in court. The three were tried separately in <LOCATION> Donalsonville </LOCATION> and sentenced in 1974 to die. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s 15-year-old brother, had been picked up in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after the prison break. A witness to the murders, he turned state's evidence and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> laughed after killing <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>. `` I asked him what was so funny,'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> recalled. `` He said, ` That bastard begged for mercy.''' He testified his brother shot four of the victims and that <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> killed one each. Some of the Aldays were shot in the head as many as seven times. In 1985 the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, while citing `` overwhelming evidence of ... guilt,'' ruled there also was `` overwhelming evidence that the community had prejudiced both guilt and sentence.'' A lower court had ruled that the convictions and sentences were based on `` the overwhelmingly uncontroverted evidence of their willful participation in what is generally regarded as the most heinous criminal orgy in the history of the state.'' But the appellate ruling held that the trials should have been moved because of pre-trial publicity and inflammatory statements by some officials. Failure to overturn the convictions, it said, `` would mean an obviously guilty defendant would have no right to a fair trial.'' More than 100,000 people signed petitions calling for the impeachment of the three judges, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld their decision. `` The judges and lawyers that did that are the ones who should be hung first,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who operates a crossroads store not far from where the Aldays are buried. He said time had not dulled emotions. `` When people around here get to talking about it, they get so mad they almost start to fight,'' he said. `` It's still very much alive. And not a day goes by but what someone does n't stop by here and ask for directions to the cemetery, people from all walks of life, some of them from as far as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' According to retrial testimony, the defendants were heading back to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in a stolen car. They were burglarizing the trailer when <PERSON> Aldays </PERSON> started arriving. In 1977, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, in a television documentary interview, said the four were after money but did n't want to go back to jail. `` We figured that they could n't take us back to prison if they could n't talk.'' <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was retried earlier this year in <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, convicted and sentenced again to death. <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> will be retried in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> later. Meanwhile, the bills for everything from lawyers to false teeth keep piling up. Since 1985, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has paid about $ 327,400, most of it to other counties for lodging the prisoners, holding hearings, transportation, security and lawyers' fees. County Clerk <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said costs for the <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> trial were about $ 160,000, and he was n't optimistic that costs for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s retrial would be lower `` -LRB- <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was tried -RRB- charged us $ 890 just for opening and closing the courtroom. They called it extra custodial service. When <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> needed a new suit to go to trial in, we paid for that.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has no teeth. At a recent competency hearing, for which <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> also paid, his lawyers asked that he be provided dentures for the trial. `` In July of 1987, we provided him with upper and lower dentures at a cost of $ 350,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said with a frown. `` If it were up to me he would n't get another set.'' He said <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is feeling the pinch. `` We have been able to continue basic services thus far,'' he said. `` I do n't know how much longer we will be able to. We depend on agriculture here, and agriculture is in disarray with foreclosures and all.'' The county borrowed $ 210,000 so it could function while it paid retrial costs. `` If we do n't get a lot more help from the state it could leave us in a very precarious way,'' he said. The state has paid $ 153,000 so far. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the cost of the initial trials was less than $ 10,000, and each lasted less than a week. Lawyers say appeals could last another decade. At Eds Pool Room, as in the rest of <LOCATION> Donalsonville </LOCATION>, memories of the Aldays and the killings are becoming the stuff of legend. The small group gathered there remembered <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> as a man who could stretch facts to transparent thinness. `` But he only told lies on himself,'' said one patron quickly. `` They used to say about him that he had to hire -LRB- someone -RRB- to call his hogs because he told so many lies his hogs would n't believe him.'' There was a silence. `` People liked <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> said. `` And those boys was good boys, as far as I knew. And she was a good woman.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' cousins in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> like to tell how his father ran away from his home on the Turkish mainland to a merchant uncle who lived on the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Mytilene </LOCATION>, after being forbidden to leave for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A telegram was sent home saying that young <PERSON> Panos </PERSON> was safe. `` And the answer came, ` Tie him up in a bundle if necessary and send him back,''' said <PERSON> Elly </PERSON> <PERSON> Petridou </PERSON>, a retired bank employee who still lives on the island. `` But my grandfather _ <PERSON> Panos </PERSON>' uncle _ knew the future lay in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and did n't obey,'' she said. `` Instead, he found <PERSON> Panos </PERSON> an English teacher and later on paid his fare from <LOCATION> Mytilene </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... And eventually his parents followed him there.'' That was early in this century. Today, at least a few `` Mike Dukakis-President'' stickers are showing up as far away from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as this northern <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island where his father lived, as Greek interest grows in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's campaign for the White House. Greek television newscasts lead off with coverage of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> primaries, and <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> newspapers run front-page stories detailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' progress. Politicians and analysts discuss the 54-year-old Democrat's lack of experience in foreign affairs. And they study his campaign speeches for clues to what might be future American policy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in interviews with <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> media, stresses his Greek heritage. But he avoids comment on eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> disputes such as the Greek-Turkish disagreement over <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> oil rights and the divided island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. A mix of pride and caution marks the mood among the half-dozen cousins and their families who make up the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> clan in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. `` We all think <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> is an exceptional person and we're convinced he'll win the Democratic nomination. But that's still a long way from getting to the White House,'' <PERSON> Patra </PERSON> <PERSON> Zourelli </PERSON>, a second cousin who lives on <LOCATION> Mytilene </LOCATION> _ also known as <ORGANIZATION> Lesbos </ORGANIZATION> _ said in an interview. From a political standpoint in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` I can tell you it's an advantage to be an immigrant's son,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was recently quoted as telling the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Vrathyni </PERSON>. `` The minorities see in me their children's opportunity to get ahead.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Panos </PERSON>, became a respected family doctor in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. His mother, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, now 83 and campaigning actively for her son, was one of the first Greek-American women to qualify as a teacher. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is probably unique in that his parents made it to the professional classes. ... Usually it's the second generation which makes that jump,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitroeff </PERSON>, a historian who teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father was the youngest of four brothers who left <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> as teen-agers in the early 1900s. It was a time when Greeks flocked to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, working in textile factories, flower stalls and shoeshine parlors to escape dire poverty at home. <PERSON> Mytilene </PERSON>, lying close to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and covered with millions of olive trees, boasts a literary tradition that began in the 7th century B.C. with <PERSON> Sappho </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first woman poet. Another lyric poet from the island, <PERSON> Odysseus </PERSON> <PERSON> Elytis </PERSON>, won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1979. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> family came from <LOCATION> Pelopi </LOCATION>, a cluster of stone houses reached by a dirt road winding up <PERSON> Mytilene </PERSON>'s highest mountain and still considered one of the poorest villages on the island. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' grandfather moved away in the 1880s to make a better life on the nearby coast of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where Greeks prospered as store-owners and merchants. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s grandfather and mine were cousins who both left the village of <LOCATION> Pelopi </LOCATION> and settled in <LOCATION> Edremit </LOCATION> on the Turkish side. His grandfather ran a general store and mine ran a bakery,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoriou-Dukakis </PERSON>, 76, a retired agronomist, said in an interview. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> property at the top of the village was sold in 1933 and <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Manolis </PERSON>, the villager who bought it, keeps the yellowed sale contract in his pocket. `` I want to stay around long enough to welcome <PERSON> Michalis </PERSON> back here as president,'' said <PERSON> Manolis </PERSON>, 81, who lives in a two-story house he built on the ruins of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> home. There are no records surviving to clarify whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father was born on <LOCATION> Mytilene </LOCATION> _ then ruled by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> _ or in <LOCATION> Edremit </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' mother was born in the northern city of <LOCATION> Larissa </LOCATION>, then a sleepy farm town but now a booming center for the <LOCATION> Thessaly </LOCATION> region. `` Cousin Euterpe is a tough lady who'd be called a feminist if she were young now. ... Her family all left for the <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the early 1900s after losing their land to the Turks,'' said <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Milingos </PERSON>, a third cousin who runs a farm chemicals business. Like most of the relatives, the <PERSON> Milingos </PERSON> family first met <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when he came to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1976 during his first term as governor. Now they visit Massachussetts regularly. `` We found him very warm and welcoming, but he's certainly a man of principle,'' said <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Milingos </PERSON>. `` When we went for dinner at their home in the days of energy-saving, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> told us to take sweaters because the heating would be low _ and it was.'' The <PERSON> Greek-American </PERSON> community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, numbering between 1 million and 3 million by various estimates, is pouring in funds to back its `` patrida'' -LRB- homeland -RRB- candidate. According to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, around 25 percent of his first $ 15 million in campaign funds came from Greek-Americans. Apart from the wish to claim a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> descent, many in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> say that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' election would repair the damage to their self-image caused by former Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> was an embarrassment to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and the migrant tradition. It's a bad memory for us that we'd like to erase through <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said former Culture Minister <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nianias </PERSON>, a member of parliament for Mytilene.

 It is the evening of April 4, 1968. The Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> leans over a balcony railing at The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>. The crack of a single shot from a high-powered rifle shatters the air. Suddenly, he's gone. This much is clearly documented. But who killed the 39-year-old civil rights leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize? <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the small-time thief who pleaded guilty, has spent the past 20 years trying to prove he did n't do it. He talks of a shadowy `` Raoul.'' Other principals in the case hold widely varying opinions: <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s attorneys disagree on whether he was the triggerman; the prosecutor acknowledges he was n't confident about the case; the chairman of a congressional committee that studied the assassination says he still thinks <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was part of a larger, unsolved conspiracy The questions remain. What of the cigarette butts found in the getaway car _ given that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> did not smoke? What of the clothing in two sizes in the car's trunk? The fatal shot came from a communal bathroom at the rear of a flophouse across a narrow street from The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> maintains he was not in that bathroom when the shot was fired. `` I was a few blocks away, trying to get a tire fixed on my car,'' he said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Brushy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> State Prison, where he is serving a 99-year sentence. `` When I started back to my room I saw a police roadblock had been set up; it was about that time that I heard on my car radio King had been shot and the police were looking for a man in a white Mustang, the same kind of car I was driving, so I took off for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who had checked into the rooming house the day King was killed, said he was in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to take part in an illicit gun-running scheme. He said the scheme was concocted by a mystery man named <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>, an international smuggler whom <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> contends he met several months earlier at a waterfront bar in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He also says <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>, whom he describes as a blond man with a Latin American accent, set him up to be framed for King's murder. `` The fact is I do n't know who killed King,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who recently turned 60. `` I only pleaded guilty because I was desperate. I had been in isolation for eight months in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> jail, and <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was pressuring me to cop a plea. He was telling me my family would get in trouble and I'd get the death penalty if I did n't do what he said.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney who represented <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> when he entered his guilty plea March 10, 1969, angrily disputes these assertions. `` The s.o.b. got down on his knees and thanked me for saving his life when I told him I had gotten the prosecutor to go along with a guilty plea,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said when contacted in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> recently. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, now in his mid-80s, says he thinks <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was extremely fortunate not to have stood trial. He also rejects <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s story about <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>. `` I think he acted alone,'' he said. Asked what might have motivated <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to commit such an act, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said, `` It was racism. His conversations simply steamed with racist remarks.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who was a fugitive from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> State Penitentiary at the time King was killed, denies he harbored any ill will toward King and defies anyone to prove otherwise. `` King was just another politician to me,'' he said. `` Why would I want to do something like kill a big-shot politician, me a fugitive, and bring all that heat down on myself?'' He admits buying the rifle, a Remington Gamemaster, 30.06 caliber, that authorities say was the murder weapon. But he says he bought, at a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, gun shop, at <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>'s instruction and with money provided by <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>. `` I gave the rifle to <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. `` If I had been buying it to kill <PERSON> King </PERSON>, you can bet I would n't have bought it at a gun shop. I would have gotten it from a fence, so it could n't have been traced.'' <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said he tends to believe that story. He represented <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> for four months before <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>. `` I've never believed <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> shot King,'' said <PERSON> Hanes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and one-time <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> mayor. `` I personally stood in that flophouse bathroom and looked across to the motel balcony where the Rev. King was standing when he was shot. It was a difficult angle. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> simply did n't have enough expertise with rifles to make a shot like that, in my opinion.'' <PERSON> Hanes </PERSON> also said he had never heard <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> utter a single racist statement. `` I've given this case a lot of thought, and I've concluded someone assisted <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>,'' he added, `` but I ca n't say who.'' The case should have gone to trial, he said, `` to clear the air, if nothing else. I tried to get the judge to try the case, but he said there was too much pressure, from the government and the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> business community, to accept a guilty plea and avoid the publicity that a trial would generate.'' The judge, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, died a week after <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s guilty plea. However, the chief prosecutor, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Canale </PERSON>, acknowledged last week that, contrary to <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s assertion, he had been happy to get a plea from <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. `` It would have been a big, time-consuming and expensive trial with dozens and dozens of witnesses from all over the country,'' said <PERSON> Canale </PERSON>, now an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` I have never regretted the guilty plea because we got a substantial sentence. Also, I did n't want to take a chance on getting a cranky juror and having a mistrial.''

 <PERSON> Canale </PERSON> added that although he had no eyewitness and the evidence against <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was largely circumstantial, he does n't buy the conspiracy theory. `` I think he acted alone,'' he said, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had found <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s fingerprint on the rifle discarded by the gunman near the scene of the crime. However, supporters of <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s story say his fingerprint was on the rifle because he had purchased it. They also note that, while <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> is a lifelong non-smoker, Viceroy cigarette butts were found in the rooming house bathroom and in his car ashtray, and that two sizes of clothing were found in his trunk. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said the fact that <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> often used his car may explain the butts in the ashtray and clothes in the trunk. `` As for cigarettes in the bathroom I ca n't say because I was never in that bathroom,'' he said. `` My prints were never found in there, you know.'' Then there were the two white Mustangs. The late <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Canipe </PERSON>, whose amusement company was located next door to the flophouse, told investigators he saw a fleeing man ditch a rifle and a small overnight bag in front of his store and then drive away in a white Mustang, one of two that had been parked in front of the store that afternoon. He described the man as having dark hair and a beard. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who was captured in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> two months after <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s death, says the fact that the gunman ditched the rifle and his bag _ which <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> says he had left in his room when he went to get the tire fixed _ shows somebody was trying to frame him. `` Why would I have dumped my stuff there for the police to find when all I had to do was put it in the car and drive away?'' he asked. After two years of hearings, ending in 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassinations </ORGANIZATION> could n't answer that question. The committee issued a report saying <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> probably had been part of a larger conspiracy. But while the committee could n't say who else had participated in the plot, it did exonerate the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, both of which had conducted extensive illegal surveillance and smear campaigns against King throughout the 1960s. Former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was known to have hated King. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents testified that no evidence could be found of conspiracies involving the Mafia, <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan or foreign communists. Some of <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s friends, however, still feel that letting <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigate <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination was like letting a hungry fox guard a henhouse. `` I have no proof but I feel in my heart that the government, probably the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, and perhaps the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, were involved,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who was with King when he died in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> hospital an hour after the shooting. `` It's just a pity but, given the way things were back then, we'll probably never know the whole truth about one of the greatest tragedies of our time.''

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> has spent most of his `` free time'' at <LOCATION> Brushy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> State Prison plotting ways to get out, either by going over the wall or into a courtroom. So far, he's been more successful at breaking out. In 1977, inmate No. 65477 managed to scale the wall and remain free for three days before being apprehended in the rugged hills near the prison. A couple of years earlier, he escaped from his cell through an air vent only to be captured inside the prison walls a few hours later. But the 60-year-old <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, native has n't been able to get back into court since March 10, 1969, the day he pleaded guilty to killing the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. And although he is doggedly determined to win a day in court, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> apparently has become more resigned to prison life than he was in his escape-artist days, which included a 1967 breakout from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>, where he was serving 20 years for armed robbery `` He's a good inmate,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON>, an officer at <LOCATION> Brushy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, a maximum security prison 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. `` He does good time and does n't cause us any trouble _ not of late, anyway.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> works in the prison laundry, earning $ 1 a day. He shares an 11-by-8-foot cell with another inmate and spends most of his weekends in the prison law library. `` I work five days a week, from 7 a.m. to 3 o'clock in the afternoon,'' he said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We get an hour a day for exercise in the yard through the week and two hours on Saturdays and Sundays.'' He maintained, as he has ever since pleading guilty, that he did n't kill King and does n't know who did. He said he pleaded guilty only because he was pressured into it. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> speaks in a quiet but determined voice when discussing his legal problems. Although he has spent nearly half of his life behind bars he still looks fit: his hair is dark, with white sideburns, his dark blue eyes are alert and his body is trim in a blue denim uniform. `` It's always a good idea to keep fit in prison,'' he said, rubbing a scar on his left cheek, the result of an attack by three black inmates in 1980. Two of his attackers got 60-year sentences for attempted murder, and the third was given 20 years. `` I got careless for a moment,'' he said, recalling the assault. `` Like a fool I went into the law library when there were no guards present. But, then I was lucky, too; they stabbed me in the arm, face and chest but never hit an artery.'' <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON> describes <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> as a quiet loner who usually keeps to himself when he goes out to the prison yard for exercise with other prisoners. Although married in 1983 to a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> artist who was teaching art appreciation to inmates, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> has n't had a visitor since last fall. To pass the time, he reads and paints _ mostly watercolor landscapes from memory. He recently helped prepare a second edition of his autobiography, which he said he wrote to tell his side of the story about the King assassination. As for his 99-year sentence, he said, `` I really do n't think I should have had to spend all this time in prison. I did n't kill anybody.''

 A positive new report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of refined oil products has helped lift oil prices out of a temporary slump. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled Wednesday at $ 17.08 per 42-gallon barrel, up 10 cents from Tuesday's close. Among refined products, the April contract for wholesale heating oil jumped 0.45 cent a gallon to 48.60 cents. Unleaded gasoline for April rose by 0.39 cent a gallon to 48.65 cents. Trading on the exchange was described as light, muted by the approach of the Easter holiday weekend. The advance came on the heels of a modest decline on Tuesday _ which had broken a four-day rally as many investors sold futures contracts and took profits.

<HEAD>Factory Orders For Manufactured Goods Declines</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Economists shrugged off an 0.8 percent decline in orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods during February, even though it represented the second consecutive monthly decline. The financial markets put in a mixed performance Wednesday. On Wall Street, the stock market faltered but the dollar showed signs of steadying in foreign exchange, where the British pound stole center stage. Bond prices were little changed. Orders for durable and non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $ 210.86 billion last month following a 0.6 percent decline in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The February setback was the biggest since a 1.4 percent drop last August and marked the first time that factory orders have fallen for two consecutive months since the summer of 1986. Economists said the declines indicated that businesses cut back on orders in the early part of the year to help trim high levels of unsold goods that had built up in the final quarter of 1987. While this process will dampen growth, economists said it appeared that the cutbacks had been moderate and would set the stage for faster growth in the months ahead. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points in the early going, closed with a 20.22-point loss at 1,978.12. Investors were reluctant to take large positions ahead of the upcoming three-day Easter weekend. The dollar showed signs of steadying after a wave of tumbles, but it was the pound that posted far greater gains, rising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to $ 1.8780 from $ 1.86425. In the past seven years, the pound has hit a low of $ 1.0470, in February 1985, and a high of $ 2.4525 in November 1980. In jumping to its highest levels in two years, the British currency has been boosted by a strong economy, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s relatively high interest rates and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s unrelenting grip on inflation Bond prices eased slightly. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue fell 7-32 point, or about $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 in face value, to yield 8.77 percent. Oil prices rebounded from a temporary setback. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled at $ 17.08 per 42-gallon barrel, up 10 cents from Tuesday's close.

<HEAD>Japan Most Creditworthy Again; Switzerland New No. 2</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-World Credit-List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has displaced <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as the world's second most creditworthy nation behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a new survey of international bankers reveals. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ for many years the bankers' No. 1 darling _ remains stuck in fourth place. And in general the world's bankers seem to be taking a gloomier view of the world debt situation. In a survey of 112 nations, <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, finds that the average country's credit rating in March has dropped considerably from a similar survey last September. Every six months the New York-based monthly asks about 100 international banks to rate the creditworthiness of more than 100 nations on a scale of 0 to 100. In the magazine's March survey <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ranks first with a score of 94.6, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> 112th with 4.0. The global average rating was 38.9, down 0.4 points from last September, and down 1.1 points from March 1987. Institutional Investor notes that this is the fourth consecutive drop from the peak of 40.6 attained in March 1986. Countries with higher credit ratings generally find it easier to borrow from international commercial banks and are likely to obtain more favorable credit terms. `` The most stable region in recent surveys has been <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the magazine says, `` but this time it registered the biggest gain of any region, rising 0.6 points to 73.9.'' One banker noted that a rising German mark may cause export difficulties for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and it faces greater unemployment difficulties than <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s rating rose 2.2 points, thanks largely to `` an austerity program ... European Community entry, and ... full-fledged transition to democracy.'' Despite <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s pre-eminence, the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region, comprising 19 countries `` led the decliners with a sizable 1.4 point fall'' in the average country rating. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> fell 2.2 points, the second-largest drop in the survey, due mainly to `` continued balance of payments deficits ... and the fact that its borrowing has now reached a very high percentage of gross national product.'' The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, comprising 14 nations, was up an average 0.4 points `` largely because no news is good news for the region. `` The biggest gainer was <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, up 1.9 points, because of ... consistent improvement in the current account.'' In Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` the big gainer was <LOCATION> Rumania </LOCATION>, up 2.2 points because of increased banker confidence that it would maintain its repayment schedule.'' `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had more gainers than losers _ 14 nations to 11 _ yet its overall rating fell 0.3 points.'' `` The <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> fell 2.0 points, the third-biggest drop in the survey,'' probably due in large part to a lack of financial information on the country. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped 1.5 points, due mainly to the budget and foreign trade deficits and the decline of the dollar. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> fell 2.3 points, the biggest decline in the survey'' because of political uncertainties and the lack of a coherent economic policy in the Third World's biggest debtor nation.

<HEAD>American Stores Stock Jumps; Lucky `Pac-Man' Bid Rumored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> may turn the tables on rival grocer <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to thwart the pursuer's $ 1.74 billion buyout offer, analysts say. Talk of the rarely used `` Pac-Man defense'' pushed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> stock up $ 2.75 to $ 59.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, while Lucky lost $ 1.50 a share to close at $ 48.37 -LCB-. Earlier this week <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 45-a-share tender offer for Lucky. But the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> supermarket giant later said it was prepared to boost the offer to $ 50 a share, or $ 1.93 billion, if Lucky's management supported the acquisition. Lucky has declined to comment on the offers, but analysts said rumors focused on whether Lucky might be considering making its own bid for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. A combination of the two companies would rival <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's largest supermarket operation. <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said the company `` does n't comment on rumors.'' The only comment Lucky has made is that its board is studying <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' two proposals. `` There has been conjecture all along about what options Lucky might have,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> noted that Lucky, which operates in the lucrative <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market, would have to take on a huge amount of debt to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts specualted Lucky might be trying to put <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> stock `` in play'' on Wall Street to take the spotlight off itself. The rumors came a day after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.S. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> complained of `` various reports'' that Lucky might be considering a `` defensive acquisition'' of another company to make itself financial unattractive. In a letter Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> cautioned against a maneuver that could interfere with his company's takeover plans and warned that any attempt to `` frustrate the choice given to your shareholders through a defensive acquisition'' would affect American's willingness to increase its tender offer to $ 50 a share. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> reiterated that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> would consider divesting stores if it acquired Lucky, in order to mitigate any antitrust concerns that might exist. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's third largest grocery retailer with 1,700 stores and annual sales of $ 15 billion. Lucky is the sixth largest with 480 stores and sales of $ 7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit last week in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> charging Lucky and its executives with breaching their fiduciary duties by `` following a course of conduct directed toward entrenching themselves in control of Lucky Stores.'' As part of defensive measures taken over a year ago to stave off corporate raider <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, Lucky voted senior management lucrative `` golden parachute'' contracts and announced a restructuring plan that included changing the company's state of incorporation from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and a buy-back of 27 percent of its outstanding shares. The company has noted that its bylaws also contain an anti-takeover provision limiting the voting power of any shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced its Blueprint tool kit, an upgraded product by <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to give its computer users easy access to a wide range of non-Lotus data bases. `` I tend to view this as a building block kind of an announcement,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Readerman </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They are trying to build a better connection between third-party data bases and their own PC software tools.'' `` It fits in their long-term strategy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` It's a positive step for the future.'' Analysts say Blueprint is part of <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' strategy to expand applications for its software in a period of increased competition from spreadsheet manufacturers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> stock rebounded slightly following Wednesday's The stock had tumbled nearly $ 7 a share since last week after the Cambridge-based firm announced plans to delay release of the Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 spreadsheet software until the fourth quarter. The delay caused analysts to cut 1988 per-share earnings estimates from about $ 1.95 to about $ 1.50. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> stock closed up 50 cents a share to $ 22.50 in over-the-counter trading Wednesday. The Blueprint kit, scheduled to be released late this year, will aid data base manufacturers in creating drives that will greatly streamline the process of accessing software not specially designed for <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> systems, said <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosheff </PERSON>. The drives will be sold to consumers by data base firms including <ORGANIZATION> Oracle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which has formally announced plans to place a Blueprint drive in its upcoming product line. Other firms expressing interest in Blueprint include <ORGANIZATION> Microrim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Synex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> statement. <PERSON> Kosheff </PERSON> said the drive will allow <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> system users to hit one key to connect with various data bases, rather than the many steps now required. Data obtained through Blueprint drives will be compatible with existing and planned <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> software, including spreadsheets and graphics, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenough </PERSON> said Blueprint is an enhancement of Application Connection, a Lotus-created data base connection drive introduced in 1986. The Blueprint drives will be available for use on all sizes of Lotus computer systems, said <PERSON> Greenough </PERSON>.

 The dollar dropped sharply against the yen today while stock prices fell slightly after three days of substantial gains. After opening lower at 125.15 yen, the dollar dropped further and closed at 124.50 yen, the day's low, down 0.93 yen from Wednesday's close of 125.43 yen. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> appeared to step into the market to support the dollar late in the morning and at the outset of the afternoon session, traders said. `` Profit-taking dollar selling brought the dollar down, but besides that there was no notable movement in the market,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Iiya </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The market still is anticipating a weaker dollar, he said. Another trader said market participants were hesitant about trading while awaiting the scheduled release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data on Friday. In addition, he said, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> markets will close for a holiday Friday and will not provide any lead for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after the data is released. Figures to be released Friday include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment in March and construction expenditures in February.

The Nikkei average gained more than 1,000 points in the three days. The dollar's fall did not affect the market, which kept a positive mood about prospects for the new fiscal year beginning Friday, he said. Investors also were cautious while awaiting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data, traders said. The volume of the first section was estimated at 1.4 billion shares, down from 1.8 billion shares Wednesday.

 Prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today, depressed by the continuing strength of the British currency and by previous declines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was off 12.3 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,744.6 at midday. Volume was a low 175 million shares, down from 232 million shares a day earlier. Volume was light on the last day before the extended Easter holiday weekend. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market is closed on Friday and Monday. The market remained in negative territory all morning, moving in a narrow range after an early markdown, dealers said. The early markdown was caused by the previous drop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and by sterling's recent rise against the Deutsche mark. Sterling was boosted by comments on Wednesday by Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who emphasized the government's commitment to fight inflation Currency dealers interpreted <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s statements as evidence the government will tolerate further rises in sterling without cutting interest rates again. Sterling's rise depressed the major exporting companies' stocks that get a competitive advantage from a weak pound.

 Mythology failed to record who supplied the wax and feathers for <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>' wings 3,500 years ago. That omission is not being repeated in 1988. Thanks to the miracle of modern public relations, corporate backers are getting a share of the acclaim in the current attempt to recreate the mythical flight of <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> from the Greek island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. A high-tech human-powered aircraft made a successful series of test flights today in <LOCATION> Iraklion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, in preparation for a world-record distance attempt that also will recreate the ancient Daedalus myth. The 68-pound ultralight <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 completed six flights lasting less than three minutes each in calm dawn weather above a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> air force base adjoining <LOCATION> Iraklion </LOCATION> airport. Five athlete pilots took turns to pedal the shimmering pink-and-silver plane at speeds of around 14 mph, flying about 15 feet above the tarmac. News releases, an innovation unknown in ancient <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, have let it be known to the world that <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Downers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, supplied gearboxes for the <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> Poly-Flex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Walworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, donated plastic wheels.

The attraction of the Daedalus Project for a corporate sponsor is obvious. It brings together high technology, teamwork, imagination and daring. `` It's been a super project. It's a natural fit for us,'' said <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertel </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION> sponsors the <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> crew and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is the financial sponsor of the aircraft itself The two companies are treating the project as part of their research-and-development efforts. <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION> says the energy drink it is developing for the <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> pilots might lead to a beverage for endurance athletes that could be sold commercially. In cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION> has developed a drink containing easily digestible carbohydrates for quick energy. `` If they -LRB- pilots -RRB- run out of energy or feel fatigued, no matter how wonderful the plane is, the engine might run out,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittam </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for science and technology. <PERSON> Whittam </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION> has recently improved the flavor of its experimental beverage, but wo n't describe the flavor. `` It wo n't be a fruit punch, I can tell you that,'' <PERSON> Whittam </PERSON> said. `` It's our secret weapon.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION>, a company with an eye for the dramatic, has also sponsored the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ski Team, the around-the-world flight of the Voyager and <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>'s rowboat trip from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. The engine of the Daedalus is a human being, so the jet engine builders at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> do n't have much to learn from it. But the air conditioner makers at Carrier could gain insights into how to keep air flowing smoothly over slowly turning blades, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief scientist of the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company. Better understanding of air flows could also help in streamlining the exterior frame of Otis elevators. It could even help the company develop concepts for a solar-powered aircraft that would hover at 100,000 feet and serve as a communications relay station for communications, <PERSON> Meyerand </PERSON> said. The high-altitude aircraft would presumably have military uses. <PERSON> Meyerand </PERSON> said it would be developed only if it received government support. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> says it has contributed $ 430,000 to the Daedalus Project, plus engineering and materials support. <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION> says it has contributed about $ 225,000, including food for the athletes and research at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the high-energy drink. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> sees its participation in part as a way of recruiting engineers from colleges such as <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> and inspiring a new generation of students. `` I hope that young men and women ... might be encouraged,'' <PERSON> Meyerand </PERSON> said. `` Rather than becoming a lawyer _ there are too many of them anyway _ they might go to engineering school.''

<HEAD>Audi: Shift-Lock Has Worked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is lashing out at critics of the shift lock on its 5000S models with automatic transmission, which it says has prevented sudden acceleration. `` They have refused to accept, and to <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>'s dismay, continue to refuse to accept, the truth about unintended acceleration,'' the importer said. The shift lock `` has been recognized worldwide as the best device available to prevent unintended acceleration,'' <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The automaker made its comments as part of a report in which it said it had received nearly 400 complaints about the shift lock. The lock prevents drivers from shifting out of park unless a foot is on the brake pedal. A car's engine can not overcome its brake, nor can a defect in the engine or transmission affect the brake system because the systems are not connected. Following studies of reports of unintended acceleration in the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> car and in vehicles by many other automakers including <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> labeled it an industry-wide phenomenon apparently caused by driver error. The shift lock prevents drivers from making the error _ hitting the gas pedal instead of the brake. Most Japanese automakers are planning to install them as standard equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said critics' attempts to discredit the shift lock serve as attempts to prevent drivers from increasing their awareness of which pedal they are stepping on. In a report to the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> submitted an analysis of the device's performance and information on 396 consumer complaints received on models with shift locks. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> installed shift locks on 1978-1986 models during a recall that began in September 1986 and remains in effect. It included them as standard equipment on 1987 and 1988 models. Of the 396 compaints, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said, all but 22 did not fit the pattern of unintended acceleration. Of the 22, 15 involved improperly installed shift locks. In the other seven cases, drivers shifted into gear from neutral instead of park. The device has no effect when the car is in neutral. In all 22 cases, tests found the brakes functioned properly, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said it has received no complaints of sudden acceleration in 1988 models. It received 16 complaints on 1987 models, but none proved to be cases of sudden acceleration, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said it has installed shift locks on more than 170,000 cars, including 93 percent of its 1984-1986 fleet and 38 percent of its 1978-1983 fleet. `` Both <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> and the federal agency continue to urge all owners of cars which have not yet responded to make dealer appointments as quickly as possible,'' the company said. `` The automatic shift lock is an effective cure,'' <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> said in the conclusion of its report to <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Accident records and insurance statistics demonstrate that the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 is among the safest cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 The stock market showed no clear trend today in an atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.48 to 1,980.60 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the early tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 308 up, 632 down and 471 unchanged.

<HEAD>RepublicBank Expects Big First-Quarter Loss, May Default on Debts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Ailing <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major bank holding company that recently received a $ 1 billion federal bailout, said it expects a significant first-quarter loss. The Dallas-based company also reported Wednesday in documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it may default on about $ 33 million in long-term debts, a move which could prompt creditors to demand immediate repayment. `` These factors, among others, indicate that the corporation may be unable to continue in its present form,'' <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> said in a draft of its annual report to shareholders filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Shareholders have not yet received the report. Meanwhile, two class action suits have been filed by investors against the company and seven of its top executives in federal district court in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. First RepublicBank, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest bank holding company and the 13th-largest in the nation, said it expects a `` significant loss'' during the first quarter of 1988. Company insiders expect the loss to exceed $ 500 million. The loss was caused by major deposit outflows, increases in funding costs and in problem loans, especially in real estate. The company received a $ 1 billion bailout from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on March 17. In giving the aid, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said no protection was offered for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors and shareholders. At the same time, the company suspended dividend payments to holders of preferred shares. The two class action suits accuse <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> of misleading investors about the company's financial health. The investors allege misrepresentation and fraud in the sale of securities issued before <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last June. In the first suit, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodores </PERSON> claims that he and other investors saw the value of their <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> securities plummet after the company's bailout request. He claims that investors were n't adequately informed about First RepublicBank's condition and the possibility that the company would seek federal assistance. First RepublicBank spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> declined comment on the litigation. In documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> said it may default on about $ 33 million in long-term debt during the first half of the year. If that happens and creditors demand immediate repayment, the company said, `` the holders of as much as approximately half of the consolidated long-term debt of <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> may have the right to accelerate the due date of their debt.''

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed today in very light activity on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Little price movement was expected with many traders taking to the sidelines ahead of two eagerly awaited <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports due out after the close, analysts said. The annual report on spring planting intentions will give the market a broad indication of the potential size of this year's corn and soybean crops. The quarterly grain stocks report will reveal the levels of grain on hand as of March 1. Together, the reports will indicate whether futures prices should go higher to encourage more planting to meet the expected demand, or lower to discourage plantings. `` People are afraid to take any position going into these reports whether the news is positive, negative or neutral,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's been a good four or five years since we've had that kind of situation.'' In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.02 -RCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to -LCB- cent lower with May at $ 2.09 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower with May at $ 1.60 a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with May at $ 6.48 -LCB- a Most cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .08 cent to .10 cent higher with April at 75.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .05 cent higher with March at 82.75 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .12 cent higher with April at 45.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to .35 cent lower with May at 55.55 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures retreated on Wednesday.

 It's been slipped into everything from frying pans to space suits to the nation's political vernacular, and now <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON>, still the slickest solid on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, is sliding into its second half-century. Discovered accidentally April 6, 1938, by a young chemist named <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, the waxy white plastic turns 50 this week, still dominating dozens of scientific and consumer uses with no hint of a higher-tech replacement. It keeps the eggs from sticking to frying pans, for sure. But it also coats electrical wires, chemical tanks, jogging suits and lightbulbs. It's used to patch human hearts. It keeps the Statue of Liberty from rusting. `` The applications, as far as I can tell, are no smaller than our imaginations,'' says <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, now a septuagenarian retiree from the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> chemical company. `` I'm amazed at the impact. And there's more to go.'' The reason for Teflon's endurance is simple: Nothing else is so slippery, so tough and such a good insulator, all at the same time. Even after five decades, `` It is unique in these qualities,'' says professor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, a specialist in such materials at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. It's a discovery that almost slipped away. <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, two years out of college, was working with refrigeration gases in a <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> lab in <LOCATION> Deepwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, when an assistant pulled a cylinder of Freon out of a dry ice storage bin, turned it on _ and nothing came out. Someone else might have assumed the cylinder had leaked and tossed it away. <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> did n't. He weighed the cylinder. He shook it. He cut it open. `` A white solid material was obtained, which was supposed to be a polymerized product'' of the Freon compound, <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> recorded laconically in his lab notebook entry of 4-6-38. Voila. `` People describe it as a lucky chance, a bit of serendipity or a flash of brilliance,'' says <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, an inductee into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. `` I like to think of it as a combination of all three.'' The serendipity, he notes, extended beyond the discovery itself. It soon was found that the chance chemical reaction that produced Teflon can have unhappy consequences. `` If there was any luck involved in the discovery,'' says <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, `` probably part of it was that we did n't get blown up.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> testers gradually established Teflon's extraordinary properties. It is `` damn near inert,'' says <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>; it wo n't react with chemicals or break down in the environment. It withstands temperatures from 400 degrees below zero to 500 degrees above. Energy passes through it without heating it up. It holds together in a vacuum, meaning it's perfect for use in outer space. Lawrence English, editor of Materials Engineering magazine, likens the impact of Teflon to that of the transistor. `` There's nothing quite like it,'' he says `` It's pervasive in technical environments _ all over the place, in a lot of really curious and diverse applications.'' At the beginning, it was under wraps, restricted to government defense work from 1941, when <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> first was able to produce it, until 1948. It was used in the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project for gaskets and vessel linings to contain a highly corrosive chemical needed in the production of the atom bomb. It also coated wires in electronic devices, making them considerably fire resistant. Today, the greatest commercial use of Teflon is in wire coating, followed by gaskets and shaft seals and pipe and tank coatings. <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON> did n't reach the public eye until May 1956, when a store in <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, put the fist Teflon-lined pan on its shelves. The idea stuck, and an estimated 500 million pots and pans coated with Teflon have been sold since. It was n't until 20 years later that <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON> moved from kitchen to clothes closet. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who was in the wire coating business, found that a piece of stretched <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON> has pores big enough to let water vapor out but too small to let water droplets in. He stuck it to fabric and called it Gore-Tex, the first waterproof-breathable clothing. <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON>'s next frontier was the language. That breakthrough came the morning of Aug. 2, 1983, as <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> was cooking eggs for the kids. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> happens to be a Democratic congresswoman, and as she slid the eggs out of a frying pan, she reflected on the way political accountability, in her view, slid off President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I said, ` He's just like this pan,'' she recalled last week. `` Nothing sticks.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may start the day's session with one-minute speeches, and this is how <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> started hers that day: `` Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>, after carefully watching <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he is attempting a great breakthrough in political technology _ he has been perfecting the Teflon-coated presidency.'' The phrase, picked up by the papers, caught on within weeks. `` Americans love shorthand descriptions of things,'' reflects <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. `` The only problem was that it did n't work. Still nothing stuck to him.'' Political efficacy aside, one outfit that did n't appreciate the publicity was <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which holds the Teflon trademark even though the patent on the formula has long expired. `` They were most unhappy. A guy came by my office from their corporate headquarters and kind of snarled and growled about it,'' even threatening a copyright infringement lawsuit if she kept using the phrase, <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> says. `` I could hardly keep a straight face.'' But when it comes to Teflon, there has n't been much else for <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> to snarl or growl about _ a spokeswoman says the company has sold 2.4 billion pounds of Teflon. The current price is about $ 5.50 a pound. As for <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, his work with <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON> ended almost as soon as it was begun. After three months, he was transferred to another <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> lab. He spent his career working with Freon, not Teflon. <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> did not get a direct share of Teflon profits. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> does n't work that way. But the company has two bonus pay systems, one for outstanding work and another for a contribution beyond the call of duty. Says <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>: `` I got'em both.''

<HEAD>MCI Looking for Positive Cash Flow by Early 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expects that by early 1989 the company will achieve a positive cash flow for the first time in its 20-year history, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday. Once that goal is achieved, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> plans to reduce its debt and later begin buying back the 16 percent stake in the company held by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>. The company, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, wants to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 67 percent to around 40 percent over the next four years, <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said. `` At that point, we would look at the market and see if the next step is to buy back the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> stock,'' he said. `` We're talking three to four years before we would consider that and then we'd have to consider market conditions.'' <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> confirmed a report in Thursday's editions of The Wall Street Journal, in which <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> officials outlined the company's future plans Financial pressures on the company have eased now that it has finished building its digital network. It also has added 800 service, operator services and direct-dial service virtually worldwide to match the offerings of industry leader <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 in exchange for 47 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> stock Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> can not acquire more than 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s stock without the company's approval. With a stock repurchase, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> could assure its independence and increase its earnings per share, <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> ended 1987 with earnings of $ 88 million, or 31 cents per share, on revenues of $ 3.94 billion. The company's capital and other expenses exceeded its cash flow by $ 200 million last year. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s stock-repurchase plans. A company achieves positive cash flow when its net profit plus depreciation is greater than its expenditures on dividends and investment in plant and equipment. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> does not pay dividends.

<HEAD>Income Taxes Fair? Consider This</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Among the benefits proclaimed for the Tax Reform Act of 1986 were simplicity and fairness, but with each tax return filed this year those claims become more questionable. Simplicity obviously has n't been achieved. And fairness? While a quality such as this involves less obvious and more subjective judgments, there is evidence to suggest it is absent from many chapters of the 1986 law. Consider this: An investor in mutual funds could be forced to pay taxes on profits never realized _ in fact, pay taxes on money lost. Mutual funds, remember, are viewed as the sanctuary of the small investor who does n't have time or inclination to challenge the marketplace. What could be simpler, such people reason, than to turn over funds to professionals? The problem with this reasoning, as experienced investors know, is that there are good funds, mediocre funds and poor ones, just as there are superior stocks, ordinary stocks and stocks that go nowhere but down. While that can be surprising enough to some folks, it is nothing compared to the shock of finding, as many will, that they have incurred taxes while losing money, thanks to the 1986 tax law. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a widely circulated economic newsletter, calls attention to this bizarre twist. Its elements are easy to follow: 1. Unlike individual investors who can decide when to buy or sell an investment, a mutual fund investor leaves that decision to the fund's manager. 2. When a fund sells investments, 98 percent of the net gains must be paid out as a distribution to the fund's shareholders. 3. The money is either given in cash or automatically reinvested in more fund shares. But either way, the shareholder must pay tax on the distribution. All shareholders in the fund are equally liable. 4. However, because the fund made money on its investment does not mean the shareholder made money on his or her investment. It's a matter of timing 5. That timing becomes especially relevant because of the enormous, 5-year price runup of many funds _ and the sudden collapse on Oct. 19. Those who were with the fund for five years did indeed gain; many others did n't. 6. For example, an individual who bought on Oct. 15 might have paid a premium for fund shares. The fund then sold some investments for a profit. The investor did n't share in those profits _ but he is taxed as if he did. 7. Making the situation more outrageous, says <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>, is that such an investor might have seen his investment plummet, for two reasons: First, whenever a fund makes a distribution, the fund's net asset value is reduced by the amount of the distribution. Secondly, the crash reduced the value even more, in some instances by huge percentages. <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON> offers this example: `` Let's say you paid $ 18.11 per share for a fund after Bloody Monday. Since then the fund has distributed $ 2.42 in capital gains. `` The net asset value of the fund was reduced by the $ 2.42 distribution, and has subsequently fallen another 34 cents. But, since you must pay 68 cents in capital gains taxes on the $ 2.42 distribution, your real loss is $ 1.02.'' Remember, the fund might have had a gain on the particular stock it sold. You might not have had a gain, and you might have had a loss. It does n't matter. This is the worst of both worlds, says <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>. `` First you get zapped by the bear market, then Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> rubs salt in the wound by taxing a gain you never realized.''

 The stock market lapsed into a broad decline today in an atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.95 to 1,968.17 by noontime on Wall Street.

 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators broke a longstanding deadlock today and moved to place sharp import curbs on <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a subsidiary for selling submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviets. Approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> provision as part of a sweeping trade bill came despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposition and a major lobbying campaign by the Japanese electronics manufacturer. On the eve of the action, several <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officials warned lawmakers that a stringent punishment for <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> could precipitate a presidential veto of the 1,000-page trade bill. They said the president should have more flexibility in determining national security and trade relations with other countries. `` I was elected as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator to represent the State of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and not <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> and not <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and not the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and not <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>,'' declared Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, in urging lawmakers to defy administration opposition. He said he was embarrassed that a Republican administration would fight the sanctions, adding, `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been kicked in the shins and instead of saying ouch they have chosen to surrender. The provision was accepted by a subcommittee of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee working on a compromise version of the trade bill. It would ban for three years <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government procurement of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> products. The company has massive sales within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of televisions, microwaves and other electronic products. It would ban import for three years of products manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the subsidiary involved with the Norwegian firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vapenfabrikk </ORGANIZATION> in selling sophisticated computerized milling equipment to the Soviets that the administration says has greatly submarine propeller noise. There would be exemptions for national security. The measure also provides for a two to five-year ban in the future on imports of products by foreign makers that violate the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Cocom </ORGANIZATION> agreement under which western nations act to keep high-tech equipment with military uses out of communist hands. But the president could waive such action against parent companies in some cases. Lawmakers are pushing to put the finishing touches on the trade bill before starting on their spring break. `` We're going to give it our best,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Wednesday as a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee plowed through a stack of proposals but stopped short of the big decisions. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to have all the provisions wrapped up except a few minor loose ends before heading for its spring break at the end of the week. The committee, attempting to fashion a compromise between rival 1,000-page trade bills passed by the two houses, heard Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., appeal to lawmakers to save the heart of his controversial trade plan The plan to force 10 percent annual reductions in unfair surpluses that other countries run with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> formed the centerpiece of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s abandoned campaign for president. He said any final version should focus on key countries that make unfair trade practices part of a systematic trade strategy. Wholesale negotiations should be shunned in favor of working on major trade trouble spots, he said. Mandatory retaliation is needed when negotiations fail, he said. `` You have to have a stick in the closet,'' he said. But he added that flexibility is necessary in dealing with trading partners and the president should have the power to waive retaliation.

<HEAD>Trump Gives Up Tender Offer for Resorts International Stock</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> gave up his $ 22-a-share tender offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock he does n't own, saying he is confident a takeover bid by entertainer-businessman <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will never be approved Control of Resorts International is now held by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who owns nearly all of Resorts' 572,000 Class B shares that have 100 votes each, giving him 88 percent of the company's voting power. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> revised his offer for $ 36 a share for all of the company's Class A stock and called for Resorts to sell <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> 1.2 million new Class B shares at the same price. The new stock would give <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> voting control. The company has 5.7 million Class A common shares that have one vote each. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said late Wednesday he will return all tendered shares after his offer. The merger agreement expires at midnight tonight. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he will never sell his Class B stock and will not pay more than $ 22 for Class A stock. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said Wednesday he is no longer making his offer contingent upon <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> tendering his Class B stock or terminating a five-year management contract valued at about $ 100 million for Resorts' hotel-casinos in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Consummation of the offer would result in <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> owning a majority of the voting power and more than 90 percent of the equity of Resorts. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would be able to participate in <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s new offer only by converting his stock to Class A shares. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, through his privately held investment firm, <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, made his revised offer to Resorts' outside directors, noting he believes only those board members should vote on the proposal. `` The other directors have interests in Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s competing bid,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said. Three of Resorts' six directors are nominees of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who is the company's chairman. Resorts referred media inquiries to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would continue to use his voting power to resist <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer and it was unlikely Resorts' outside directors would meet independently to consider the proposal <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is offering $ 22 a share to buy the Resorts stock he does n't already own and take the company private. In mid-March, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> countered with a bid of $ 35 a share, or $ 225 million, for all of the company's stock, but it was contingent upon <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> tendering his stock and terminating the management pact. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has repeatedly indicated he would n't agree to either contingency. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> subsequently said he would boost his bid to $ 295 million, with Resorts' board members able to decide how to apportion the additional $ 70 million between Class A and Class B holders. The move was seen as a way to pay a higher price to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, but the New Yorker again said he was n't interested.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Says It Pays To Shop Around for Long-Distance Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Long-distance calling options are many and prices are competitive, but residential consumers as well as small and larger businesses still can save money by shopping around, according to a private survey. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> shows that most of the long-distance companies offer various calling plans, each one benefiting different calling patterns. The nonprofit, consumer group recommends that residential consumers periodically compare available options _ annually for those whose long-distance costs are less than $ 10 per month and more often when monthly bills are more than $ 25. Though cost gaps between competing companies and plans have narrowed, `` the risk in picking the wrong plan can result in paying substantially more in long-distance service,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a consultant to the consumer group. The survey outlined the options available from eight of the largest long-distance carriers and the costs, calculated in various call volumes, of the plans. The survey also compared costs for businesses that spend up to $ 8,000 a month on long-distance calling. For these business callers, some of the calling plans available _ including new `` virtual WATS'' plans _ can save 25 percent over standard rates of even the lowest cost companies, <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION> says. Unlike traditional WATS service, the new `` virtual WATS'' plans offered by all the major companies require no special installation or dedicated lines. The residential and small business comparisons include the option of access-code dialing, or casual calling, which allows a caller to reach a long-distance carrier other than their chosen one by dialing an access code, 10 plus a different three-digit number for each company. This option can be cheaper than some `` dial 1'' plans at lower call volumes, but volume discounts are generally not available with code dialing. A comparison of the costs for a sample residential monthly bill _ 20 calls totaling 380 minutes, 70 percent of which are calculated at night-weekend rates _ showed <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> bonus plan was the cheapest at $ 53.84. <LOCATION> MidAmerica </LOCATION> standard service followed at $ 54.06, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> standard service at $ 54.60, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <ORGANIZATION> Reach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> basic plan at $ 55.14, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint 10333 and 10777 access at $ 55.24, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> standard rates at $ 55.62. When a sampling of 33 calls were priced, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint standard rates were least expensive, followed by <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint 10333 and 10777 access, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> standard rates, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s Prime Calling Option and the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> plans. Another sample of 20 calls, this time with 70 percent of the 380 minutes calculated at daytime rates, was analyzed to assess the costs a small business might pay. In that comparison, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> standard rates were least expensive at $ 88.88, followed by <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> standard rates at $ 89.32, Allnet standard service at $ 89.95, <ORGANIZATION> TDX </ORGANIZATION> standard service at $ 90.08, and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> 10222 access at $ 90.03.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Fall to Lowest Levels in Nearly Six Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN STAINER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa prices reacted to forecasts of large world surpluses by falling Thursday to their lowest levels in nearly six years, traders said. Cocoa beans for May delivery fell to $ 1,692 a metric ton, $ 30 lower than overnight levels and their lowest price since mid-1982. Traders said the market reflected the prospect of a fourth consecutive season of surpluses, with record world production forecast in the current season running from October 1987 to September 1988. International merchants <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> said in a report released Thursday that, based on expected record crops in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, it is forecasting 1987-88 world output to hit a record 2.106 million tons _ up six percent from 1986-87 They said this `` remarkable growth'' in production would cause output to exceed consumption by 122,000 metric tons, despite a 3.6 percent rise in consumption over 1986-87. Such an imbalance would take accumulated inventories by the end of the present season to 713,000 tons, the highest since 1964-65, they said. The <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> crop is estimated to be 630,000 tons compared with 590,000 in 1986-87; <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 426,000 tons vs. 369,000; and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s 190,000, up from 164,000. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> projected Nigerian output will be 135,000 tons, up 55,000 tons from 1986-87 and the biggest since 1984-85. <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>'s harvest is forecast at 185,000 tons, down slightly from 228,000 last season The cocoa market has been regulated by supply and demand mechanisms since Feb. 25 when intervention buying by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was halted indefinitely because purchases had reached the maximum 250,000 tons permitted by treaty. Importing and exporting member countries failed to agree on supplementary market-support schemes at a meeting here in March. The organization is not scheduled to meet again on the issue until September.

 In new public service commercials for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>, a mugger tears a coat off the back of a homeless man, an assailant grabs an unsuspecting woman and an older man is felled at the office by a heart attack. By the end of the 30-second ads, the homeless man gets a new coat, the distraught woman dresses up to face the world again and the older man enjoys restored health on a beach. They each got help from agencies assisted by donations to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Voort </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that by showing people the `` vital link'' between their donations and good deeds, the ads may help dispell skepticism about charitable organizations. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the non-profit organization that oversees $ 1.1 billion a year in public service advertising, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> is the first organization to address the issues of homelessness and rape in a national advertising campaign. She said she expects `` exceptionally strong media play'' for the campaign with the media donating more than $ 70 million in free time and space this year, up from $ 40 million donated for the national <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> campaign last year. The ads were created by the New York-based agency <ORGANIZATION> Lowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marschalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which took over responsibility for the campaign this year. The ads continue the theme `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>. It brings out the best in all of us.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Voort </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> raised about $ 2.6 billion last year and channelled the money to 37,000 agencies that help people in some way. But she said research showed many people were unaware that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> donations helped organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> provide coats to the homeless, rape crisis centers counsel abused women and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> provide training that often helps save the lives of heart attack victims. She said <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Marschalk </PERSON> was asked to `` tell a story in 30 seconds'' that demonstrates how donations help people in the community. `` Twenty minutes ago, this man's last shred of dignity was stripped right off his back,'' a narrator says in the spot where a mugger tears the coat from a homeless man. `` Where do you go when your world is this cold, this cruel,'' the voice asks as the homeless man shivers in the shadow of a stone column. The commercial then shows the man putting on a new coat, as <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Marschalk </PERSON> makes the connection it has been asked to draw in three succinct phrases. `` He got help at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. They got help from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>. Thank God, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> got help from you,'' the narrator says. The Advertising Council is distributing the commercials and radio versions of the ads to networks, cable outlets and local stations across the country. Print versions of the campaign should be ready in a month, said <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Marschalk </PERSON>'s president, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>. The agency has previously created public service campaigns for a free press, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Company, Two Executives Fined $604,000 For Using Foreign Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A company fined $ 604,000 for using foreign-made steel in hacksaws sold to the government will appeal a verdict that found it violated the Buy American Act, its attorney said Thursday. `` It is not a rational interpretation of the Buy American Act,'' said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Facher </PERSON>, who represented Rule Industries in the case. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury on Wednesday convicted Rule Industries and two of its executives of 302 violations of the act, which calls for goods purchased by the federal government for public use be manfactured with mostly American-made parts. The number of violations corresponds with the number of invoices the company submitted during its contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and 1982 totaling $ 1.3 million. The jury ruled the company was liable because it purchased 10-inch steel `` blanks'' from suppliers in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The blanks were milled, hardened and tempered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Rulings in the case indicated that it would not have been a violation of the act had Gloucester-based Rule Industries purchased sheets or coils of steel from foreign suppliers and cut the blanks from them. `` The act is really being interpreted in a bizarre fashion,'' <PERSON> Facher </PERSON> said. `` It's a very complex and old piece of legislation that dates back to the Depression and has never really been definitively interpreted by a court.'' The case is believed to be the first jury trial in the enforcement of the 55-year-old act, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> had filed a civil lawsuit in 1985 against Rule Industries, a diversified manufacturer of marine and hardware products; its president, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Anastos </PERSON>, and its vice president, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sable </PERSON>. Each was charged with violating the act. The jury said the defendants falsely represented that domestic steel was used to fulfill four contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>, the main contracting arm of the federal government. Rule Industries officials had said when the suit was filed the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> was well aware of its steel-purchasing practices. During the trial, several former employees testified that <ORGANIZATION> Rule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> executives hid the source of the steel by destroying containers shipped from overseas, blackening out foreign markings and removing shipping labels from packages. `` There were a number of very honest employees who got offended when their company lied to the government,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, a first assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney.

 The board of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> put off until Friday a decision on whether to reaffirm its merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. or accept the competing bid of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> In a statement today, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said both suitors presented revised bids of more than $ 6.6 billion each to the board at its day-long meeting Wednesday. The board had been expected to announce today whether it would reaffirm its support for its agreement with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> or reverse itself and choose <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. However, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> submitted another revised offer this morning and the board would meet again Friday morning to consider both bids. For the first time since it announced its cash-and-stock offer a month ago, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> put a value on the stock end of its bid and also gave shareholders the option of taking all cash for their shares, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in a statement. In its bid today, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 78.92 a share in cash for 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.5 million outstanding shares, and said it would pay $ 60 in cash or exchange five shares in a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for each remaining The deal had a blended value of $ 75.14 a share, or a total of $ 6.73 billion, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said. In its latest bid, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay $ 74 a share for approximately 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s shares, and the same amount for the remaining 20 percent after a merger, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said. That would make the Toronto-based developer's bid worth $ 6.62 billion. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> had an edge over <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> with the offers now on the table, but he cautioned, `` <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> could always come out and say they're going to offer a higher bid.'' Wall Street analysts had said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> would be forced to put a value on the `` stub'' _ or securities _ portion of its offer to compete with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. Many investors, including arbitragers who hold a sizeable portion of Federated stock, were leaning toward the certainty of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s all-cash offer. Investors reacted enthusiastically to the higher bidding. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock was up $ 2.25 to $ 72.50 in early afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Before Wednesday's meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 73 a share in cash, or $ 6.53 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had said it would pay $ 82 each for 70.5 million Federated shares and $ 37 for each of the remainder of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.5 million outstanding shares in a subsequent merger. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also had proposed a friendly merger under which it would pay $ 73 a share for 70.5 million shares in a tender offer and $ 73 for the remaining shares following the merger. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer prior to the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board meeting on Wednesday was $ 77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, for a total of $ 5.4 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> said it would exchange shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities for the remainder of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s shares. Analysts valued the offer at $ 6.3 billion. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> presented an offer at the meeting similar to today's proposal, but which had an aggregate value of $ 73.88 a share or a total of $ 6.61 billion. That offer was superseded by today's bid. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the latest <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> bid, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Joele <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> the opportunity to address the board on Wednesday, but the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> declined to appear. <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> spoke to the directors and presented `` his vision of the combined company,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has fought the merger agreement <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> forged with <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> a month ago with lawsuits and higher bids. If <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s directors again select <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer, Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is expected to continue in court the battle it began with a $ 47-a-share offer on Jan. 25 <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer was scheduled to expire Monday. The expiration of the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> offer was uncertain, pending completion of financing requirements for the acquisition. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> had given both companies the chance to submit what it called `` final bids'' after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent offer. On Tuesday, the companies were in court after <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> announced procedures for the submission of final offers. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> objected to the guidelines on grounds they favored <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> denied the Canadian company's request for a temporary restraining order blocking the procedures. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> argued the procedures were illegal because they embraced <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense and agreements between <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> asked that whichever company was not chosen either terminate its offer or extend it for 30 business days. An extension would give the advantage to whichever company <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> backed, because shareholders would likely tender their shares to the suitor whose offer expired first. Sand stipulated that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> could not invoke defensive measures _ including its controversial poison pill _ before the losing party had a chance to challenge those measures in court. The poison pill would make a takeover attempt more expensive by allowing the retailer's shareholders to buy more company stock at a discount, unless Federated's management supported the bid. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had sought unsuccessfully in court to have the pill invalidated. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also objected to an agreement under which <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> would pay <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> `` break-up'' fees if a <ORGANIZATION> Macy-Federated </ORGANIZATION> merger failed for reasons other than a Macy default. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s divisions include <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s department stores; <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main Street and Children's Place specialty stores. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> owns nearly 100 department and specialty stores. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which started in real estate development in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, moved into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail market at the end of 1986 by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

An earlier, $ 17-per-share bid by the management group, headed by <ORGANIZATION> PIP </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Marotto </PERSON>, was permitted to expire two weeks ago when the company entered into talks with an unidentified third party that was offering $ 17.50 per share, or $ 68.25 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> illegally charged $ 100 deductibles to perform some automobile repairs it should have done in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> for free under the state's lemon law, a mid-level state appeals court ruled. The Appellate Division of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was `` unjustly enriched'' by charging <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consumers the deductibles and must make restitution. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> contended in court that the state's 1983 lemon law, designed to provide New Yorkers with replacement vehicles or money back if their new cars exhibit irreparable flaws, did not allow <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to impose the deductibles. According to court papers, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> paid the cost of all repairs for its new cars during the first 12 months or 12,000 miles. But under an extended limited warranty, the automaker charged $ 100 each time it made repairs to the power train and other major components of cars with 12,000 to 18,000 miles or between one and two years old. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> argued in court that the state's lemon law prohibits automakers from imposing a deductible for repairs on new cars during their first 18,000 miles or two years. A state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, ruled in December 1986 that the lemon law prohibits <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> from imposing the deductibles, but he did not order the automaker to provide restitution. In the 5-0 ruling by the appellate division Thursday, however, Presiding Justice <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said he and his colleagues `` choose to exercise our discretion'' by ordering <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to give the money back. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> rejected arguments by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> attorneys that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s lemon law is unconstitutional and that it violates interstate commerce laws <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> conceded that while <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> may not have detailed records of all customers it improperly charged for repairs, `` it would not be impracticable to give purchasers during the relevant time period a general notice and a time period to come forward.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> sent the matter back to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> level to devise an `` appropriate restitution procedure'' for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to follow. He was joined in his decision by state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercure </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, said the attorney general's office has no accurate total of how many New Yorkers were improperly charged the deductibles. But she said it's believed refunds could total `` in the millions of dollars.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacovara </PERSON>, a Washington-based attorney who represented <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in the case, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. The ruling could be appealed to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.

 Wall Street `` whiz kid'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> pleaded guilty to mail and securities fraud today for allegedly bilking investors out of $ 10 million which the 23-year-old sunk into art work, cars and two fully furnished homes for himself. `` I said I was a money manager, but I did not invest their money as I told them I would,'' the baby-faced 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> told duped investors that he also represented the <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family, the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, even though he did n't. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who was once profiled in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> feature on new art collectors, faces five years in prison and a maximum fine of double the amount lost by investors at his May 12 sentencing.

 Grain and soybean futures closed mixed Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in light trading ahead of two important government reports and the three-day holiday weekend, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report on spring planting intentions and its quarterly report on grain stocks, both due out after the close on Thursday, were expected to set the trend for corn and soybean futures prices for the next 30 days. Together, the reports were expected to indicate whether futures prices should go higher to encourage more planting to meet the expected demand, or lower to discourage plantings, analysts said. The reports were to be released at 2 p.m. CST. The markets can not react until Monday, however, because they will be closed Friday. Soybean prices advanced in Thursday's session while wheat and corn prices retreated. At the close, wheat was -LCB- cent to 3 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 2.99 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.09 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.61 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.53 a bushel

 The stock market declined slightly today in an atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.66 to 1,976.46 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 545 up, 893 down and 488 unchanged. Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions through the weekend, especially with a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report due out Friday on the employment situation for March. Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the employment data until Monday. In the last monthly set of figures, a much stronger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt the bond market a sharp setback. Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to clients on their performance in the first quarter, which ends with today's trading. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> rose 2 to 83 -LCB-. The company said its first-quarter earnings are expected to come in above $ 2 a share, against $ 1.31 in the comparable period last year. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .31 to 145.91.

<HEAD>Bonds Sold To Finance Kohlberg's Buyout of Jim Walter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what is being billed as one of the largest non-government issues in history, $ 1.45 billion in bonds have been sold to help <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pay off bank loans from its buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> took <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> private last year for about $ 2.4 billion, about $ 2 billion of which was financed by bank loans Since then the New York-based investment firm has been selling selected <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s assets to help finance the deal. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is a diversified building materials and natural resources company that operates primarily in the South and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. It also is one of the country's largest home builders, specializing in inexpensive, partially finished `` shell'' houses. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> had 74,000 single-family mortgages in 22 states totaling $ 1.74 billion that were packaged together to back the bond issue. `` KKR realized they had a very unusual asset in these mortgages,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> said the bond issue was `` totally sold out to a blue-chip list'' comprised of large pension funds, life insurance companies and banks from around the world. The mortgages were sold to a special trust and used to back the bond issue, which Financial Security guaranteed with a triple-A rating. Homeowners pay their morgtages into the trust, which has a cushion to protect against any defaults by homeowners. That cash flow will pay the interest on the bonds, which were sold in five different maturities, each carrying a different interest rate. `` The purpose was not to take weak credit and make it triple-A and take on risk, but to take complex and unusual collateral that the marketplace has difficulty understanding'' and package it to sell, <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> said. The average buyer of a <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> home requires a low-cost mortgage and therefore is not a typical homebuyer. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> does not provide the land on which its houses are built, which cuts down on the price of the homes. In addition, the company leaves its houses as much as 30 percent incomplete, making them affordable to blue-collar, first-time homebuyers, <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> has spearheaded a number of major leveraged buyouts, including the $ 6.2 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. The company said this week that it is seeking permission to acquire up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Resorts Stock Falls as Trump Ends Bid, Vows to Block Griffin Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock slumped Thursday as investor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who holds 88 percent of the company's voting power, withdrew his bid to take the hotel-casino operator private and indicated he would block a higher, rival offer by entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. Resorts' Class A stock fell by $ 1.62 -LCB- per share to $ 28.87 -LCB- in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s bid, which was revised Wednesday for the second time, was an attempt to make an end run around <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s repeated objections and force Resorts' outside directors to vote on the plan free of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s influence. `` The <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts have consistently ruled that a corporation's outside directors are charged with the duty to conduct a fair bidding contest,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Outside directors have been authorized by the courts to take all reasonable steps, including diluting a major shareholder, in order to obtain the best deal for the public shareholders.'' However, some analysts were skeptical of whether <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> could succeed. `` Because <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer is conditional, they -LRB- Resorts' outside directors -RRB- have an out. They can simply refuse to consider it on grounds that it is unlikely it would be able to succeed,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Isgur </PERSON>, a leisure-time industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Resorts' board, composed of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and two of his nominees plus three outside directors, is scheduled to meet Monday. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is chairman of Resorts. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s latest proposal dropped two previous conditions _ that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agree to sell his stock and terminate a lucrative five-year contract to operate Resorts properties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> imposed a new contingency _ that Resorts agree to sell him 1.2 million new shares of Class B stock, which carries 100 votes per share and would give <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> more votes that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns nearly all of the company's current 572,000 Class B shares. He was offering $ 22 per share for the company's 5.7 million Class A shares, which carry only one vote per share and hence only 12 percent of the company's voting strentgh. But he said the offer was allowed to expire at 12:01 a.m. Friday and all tendered shares will be returned to their owners. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> is offering $ 36 per share for the Class A stock, and the same price for the 1.2 million new Class B shares he is seeking. Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Applebauam </PERSON>, who represents the independent directors, indicated that he feels all Resorts directors including those nominated by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> have the right to vote on <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s merger proposal. But he said that the question of whether only outside directors should vote on the proposal to issue new Class B stock to <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> `` is a matter for further research.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON>, reiterated that he feels the full board should take up <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer.

 The dollar headed lower Thursday in subdued, pre-holiday dealings. Gold lost ground in domestic trading after rising overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 454 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 456.25 late Wednesday. Traders said the dollar moved in a narrow range throughout the session, closing near its opening levels. Most of the pressure on the currency came earlier in overseas trading, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dakin </PERSON>, foreign exchange manager at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese yen and the British pound remained very strong, which served to `` drag the dollar down and push other -LRB- major -RRB- currencies up,'' <PERSON> Dakin </PERSON> said. Traders spent the session squaring up their positions ahead of the Easter and Passover holiday weekend. Many dealers did not plan to trade on Friday, while others said they would work only half a day. `` You wo n't see a real market back until Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvello </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in reference to the four-day weekend European dealers are taking. Trading also was thin in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the dollar fell to a six-year low against the pound. The British currency continued to draw strength from Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s comments late Wednesday that fighting inflation takes priority over maintaining a stable exchange rate, dealers said. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> reportedly intervened briefly in the early going in an effort to stem the pound's strong advance, but the currency continued to climb later in the afternoon. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar hit its lowest level against the pound since January 1982. It cost $ 1.8878 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.8790 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one pound cost $ 1.8874, more expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.8780. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar dropped against the Japanese yen to close at the day's low of 124.50 yen, down 0.93 yen from Wednesday Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell further and was quoted at 124.15 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 124.35 yen, down from 125.025 yen on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.65875 West German marks, down from 1.66285; 1.3650 Swiss francs, down from 1.37215; 5.6170 French francs, down from 5.6330; 1,229.00 Italian lire, down from 1,232.75, and 1.2354 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23575.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply increased in late March, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The report, however, had no impact on interest rates in the credit markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 9.4 billion to a seasonally adjusted average of $ 2,976.5 billion in the week ended March 21 from $ 2,967.1 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 5.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,744.7 billion from $ 2,967.1 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 6.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 766.7 billion from a revised $ 760.4 billion. For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 759 billion, a 3.1 percent increase from the prior 13 weeks. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In setting its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.

 The contract for June delivery of live hogs plunged the 150-point limit for daily trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a late sell-off ahead of an important government report, analysts said. On other markets, in mostly thin trading ahead of the three-day weekend, grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals retreated; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly 10-state hogs and pigs report would prove bearish for the pork complex sparked the late plunge in hog prices, analysts said. But when the report came out after the close, experts called it neutral to bullish. The report showed the hog and pig count in states that account for 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production at about 40.5 million head as of March 1, a 6 percent increase over the same date a year ago. The average of analysts' pre-report estimates was a 5.9 percent increase. The market had already adjusted to reflect the estimates, so many analysts termed the report neutral for pork futures prices. But a breakdown of the report showed relatively small increases of 3 percent for hogs weighing 60-119 pounds, and 4 percent for hogs weighing 120-179 pounds. Those animals will be coming to market in April and May, resulting in a smaller increase in slaughters than the market experienced in March, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The likely near-term outcome is slightly higher pork futures prices, especially on contracts for delivery in the summer and fall, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said. `` Initially, it may help the back months and the fronts may sit still,'' he said. `` But as people realize that kills are not picking up, I think it's going to help everything.'' Live cattle settled .10 cent to .58 cent lower with the April contract at 74.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .05 cent higher with March at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower to .17 cent higher with April at 45.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .42 cent lower to .50 cent higher with May at 56.12 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> ahead of two eagerly awaited government reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report on spring planting intentions and its quarterly report on grain stocks, both issued after the close, were construed as very bullish for soybeans and slightly bearish for corn and wheat. The plantings report, based on farmer surveys conducted in March, predicted about a 1 percent increase in soybean acreage to 57.9 million acres. The number was well below the average pre-report estimate of 59.1 million acres. Soybean stocks, estimated at nearly 1.15 billion bushels as of March 1, were slightly below the average pre-report estimate. Because the markets will be closed Friday, they can not react to the reports until Monday. Analysts said they expected soybean futures prices to climb sharply to encourage more farmers to plant soybeans. During the next two weeks, `` I think we may go 30 to 60 cents higher from -LRB- current -RRB- levels,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, assistant vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson-McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The reports showed corn planting intentions at 66.9 million acres, up 2 percent from last year but slightly below expectations. That number was offset by the corn stocks estimate of 7.6 billion bushels, slightly above pre-report estimates. Wheat plantings were estimated at about 65 million acres, down very slightly from last year's total, while wheat stocks were pegged at 1.9 billion bushels, down significantly from last year but above expectations. In trading Thursday, wheat settled 3 cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.99 \ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.09 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with May at $ 1.61 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.53 -LCB- a bushel Precious metal futures retreated slightly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Gold settled $ 3.40 lower across the board with April at $ 454.40 a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 1 cent lower with April at $ 6.755 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures ended nearly unchanged while refined products prices were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 1 cent higher with May at $ 17.08 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .45 cent lower with April at 48.15 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .02 cent higher with April at 48.67 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 259.05.

<TEXT>
 Corn farmers intend to increase plantings this spring to 66.9 million acres, up 2 percent from 1987 but still one of the smallest planted areas in 18 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said an annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> survey of more than 70,000 farmers in early March also showed 1988 planting increases for some other crops, including soybeans, cotton, durum wheat, rice, peanuts, tobacco and sweet potatoes. Decreases were indicated for sorghum, barley, oats, winter wheat, other spring wheat and dry edible beans. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records, if farmers follow through with current plans, 1988 corn plantings would be the third-smallest since fewer than 66.9 million acres were planted in 1970. Despite the increase from 1987, this year's plantings would fall 13 percent below the 76.7 million acres planted for the 1986 corn harvest. The planted acreage dropped to 60.2 million acres in 1983, a year of drought and massive government acreage cutbacks. Officials cautioned that the actual acreage planted by farmers this spring `` may vary from intentions because of the effects of weather, availability of production inputs, changes in market conditions prior to planting'' and the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report itself. Soybean plantings were indicated at 58 million acres, up 1 percent from last year but still the second lowest acreage since 1976. Total wheat plantings, which include winter wheat seeded last fall for harvest this year, were shown at 65.1 million acres, down 1 percent from 1987. Winter wheat plants were reported at 48.6 million acres, down 0.4 percent from 1987, and `` other'' spring wheat was shown at 12.8 million acres, down 7 percent from last year. Durum wheat, at 3.73 million acres, was up 12 percent. Other crops surveyed included: _ Cotton plantings, 11.6 million acres, up 11 percent from 1987 _ Sorghum, 10.7 million acres, down 9 percent, the smallest acreage in 57 years _ Barley, 10.3 million acres, down 7 percent _ Oats, 16.3 million acres, down 9 percent _ Rice, 2.8 million acres, up 19 percent _ Peanuts, 1.6 million acres, up 3 percent, the most since 1958 _ Tobacco, 633,000 acres, up 5 percent _ Dry edible beans, 1.38 million acres, down 23 percent _ Sweet potatoes, 97,600 acres, up 1 percent

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices finished narrowly mixed Thursday in trading muted by anticipation of the three-day holiday weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely-watched 30-year issue edged up -LRB- point, or about $ 1 for every $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield slipped to 8.75 percent from 8.76 percent late Wednesday. The credit markets are scheduled to be closed on Friday in observance of Passover and Good Friday. Many traders were hesitant about taking a big position in the fixed-income market in advance of Friday's scheduled release of unemployment figures for March. With the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets closed, there would be little chance to unwind those positions until Monday if the numbers turned up a surprise. The bond market has been closely tracking fluctuations in the dollar, and the dollar moved in a narrow range throughout the session, closing near its opening levels. Bond prices initially moved lower but later recovered. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities were mixed with some off 1-32 point and others up 2-32 point and 20-year issues fell 3-32 point, according to the financial information firm <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.06 to 111.64. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.28 to 281.04. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were unchanged at 5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.04 percent and one-year bills rose 1 basis point to 6.37 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 6 -RCB- percent, up from 6 | percent late Wednesday

 Stock prices pieced together some modest gains in a quiet session Thursday amid what analysts described as an atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.94 to 1,988.06, finishing the week with a gain of 9.11 points. For the first quarter of the year, the average chalked up a net gain of 49.23 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 824 up, 678 down and 479 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 139.87 million shares, down from 151.81 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index added .38 to 146.60. Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions through the weekend, especially with a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report due out Friday on the employment situation for March. Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the employment data until Monday. In the last monthly set of figures, a much stronger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt the bond market a sharp setback. Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to clients on their performance in the first quarter as of Thursday's close The market got something of a boost from a rally in the shares of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, two widely followed stocks that have been slumping lately. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> shares climbed 2 -LCB- to 107 | and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> 1 -RCB- to 104 -LCB- Other gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 27; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 42; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, up | at 24 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, up -LRB- at 71 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 -LCB- to 84. The company said its first-quarter earnings are expected to come in above $ 2 a share, against $ 1.31 in the comparable period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 | to 72 | as the bidding competition for the company between <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> Minstar jumped 2 -RRB- to 26 \ in the over-the-counter market The company said it had received a proposal from its chairman, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, to acquire it for $ 29 a share in cash and securities. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 9.20 billion, or 0.36 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 164.27 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.02 to 300.39, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.82 at 258.89.

<HEAD>Two Countries Prepare to Sign New Five-Year Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have reached substantial agreement on a new five-year pact to expand their scientific and technical cooperation, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The new agreement, to be concluded in about three months, seeks incentives to boost the flow of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students, researchers and scientific workers to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said officials of both countries who declined to be named. They said more than 10 times as many Japanese are currently in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> classrooms, laboratories and factories as Americans studying or working in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 1980 U.S.-Japanese scientific exchange agreement, extended several times since its expiration in 1985, was extended for another three months `` to allow for legal editing of the new document, and signing at a high level,'' the department said. It will be considerably more detailed than the existing pact on the two countries' scientific and technological relationship and also provide a new management structure to oversee that relationship, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. It will provide for protection of patents and other intellectual property rights while calling for the widest dissemination of information resulting from joint research, the announcement said. Both countries were concerned about the need to increase the flow of Americans to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said the sources. They said the new agreement provides steps to be taken by both sides to make <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> more attractive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists and easier for them to go there. It envisions more funding for Japanese language study and fellowships by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, one said. The estimate that there are 10 times as many Japanese students and scientists currently in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as Americans in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a rough minimum estimate, because in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it is difficult to count students of science separately from those of other subjects or even from tourists, one official said.

<HEAD>Internal Bank Board Probe Finds `No Criminal Activity'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal agency that regulates savings institutions said Thursday that an internal investigation has found no criminal activity by a subsidiary agency that manages property from bankrupt S & amp; Ls. However, the report, by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, did reveal `` ineffective business practices'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation was requested in September by Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, after a critic of <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> complained that he was being investigated by a private detective. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, developer who was threatening a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, charged that the agency, through its law firm, hired a detective agency to probe his financial affairs. <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, reported that his office was broken into on Sept. 14 and that eavesdropping equipment was found in the ceiling. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, however, said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> had found no evidence of wiretapping at <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s office and local police had closed their break-in investigation for lack of evidence. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shure </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, said the congressman had just received the report and had not had a chance to review it. But, he added, `` We are still pursuing our own look into <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>. It is still very much a live issue. Nothing would be in that report that would make us say, ` OK we're not interested in FADA anymore.''' <PERSON> Shure </PERSON> said there has been no result reported from a parallel investigation of the charges by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, to review the bank board report. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a bank board spokesman, said the report made no judgment about the propriety of hiring a private detective agency, whose investigators in questioning <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON> identified themselves as representing a firm selling credit card. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the detective agency was hired without the knowledge of bank board officials and that the board subsequently directed that no investigators be hired without its permission. The bank board report also found no evidence to support allegations leveled by two others: <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Verona </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, real estate investor, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, developer. <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> charged that <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> officials offered him a bribe, in the form of a consulting fee, if he would back off from complaints he made to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the agency. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, said his office was broken into and ransacked after he told <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> officials he had secretly taped his conversations with them. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, real estate investors and others have criticized <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> for being too sluggish in selling property from bankrupt S & amp; Ls, thus depriving the cash-short federal fund that insures S & amp; L deposits of money. They have said the agency is riddled with conflicts of interest and wastes money. Among the poor business practices acknowledged by the bank board report were failure to return telephone calls to investors interested in buying property managed by <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> and poor dissemination of bidding information. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has been preparing its own, broader report on <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, which according to an industry newsletter is being held up by the committee chairman, Rep. <ORGANIZATION> Ferdnand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, D-R. The March 28 issue of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> cited unidentified sources who said <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, in the wake of a federal court ruling that raised questions about congressional immunity, feared the highly critical report might draw a slander suit. Congressional sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the newsletter's account adding that Republicans on the committee were blocking publication of the report in the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION>, which would be immune to a libel suit. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurano </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> St </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germain </LOCATION>, said the congressman was unavailable Thursday evening to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> aides did not return telephone calls on the subject.

<HEAD>GE To Proceed Unopposed With Offer For Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement Thursday with rival bidder <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, allowing it to proceed unopposed with a $ 507.6 million offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. GE spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said the Connecticut-based company's offer of $ 54 per share would be extended until 5 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> simultaneously announced it was terminating its $ 50-per-share offer. The battle to acquire <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, an appliance and lawn equipment manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, began last November. Earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> said they were negotiating to resolve their dispute over the proposed acquisition. `` For <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> factories and <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s strong Sears relationship makes this an important niche acquisition that will significantly strengthen our appliance business in an increasingly competitive global market,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schipke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president in charge of the company's appliance business. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> had recommended Tuesday that its shareholders accept <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s latest tender offer, rather than the $ 470 million bid from <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> that there would be no open market purchases of <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> stock until a judge ruled on a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> request for a temporary restraining order. The companies said Thursday that agreement was being continued while they negotiated, and eventually the two came to an accord. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> sought an order to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> from making a `` street sweep'' of <LOCATION> Roper </LOCATION> stock through market professionals rather than from public shareholders. The reqest came in a hearing on a GE application for a preliminary injunction to block a <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> acquisition of <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>. The terms of the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> allow <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to acquire <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> and its manufacturing capacity for kitchen ranges and lawn equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>, in return, will get rights to the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> name for major appliances. GE will supply <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> with Roper-brand electric and gas ranges at competitive prices for at least two years, according to a press release from the companies. The parties also agreed to other commercial relationships whereby GE would sell to <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> certain industrial components and materials. Lawsuits filed by both companies will be withdrawn upon completion of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer, the companies said.

 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reached tentative agreement Thursday night on a sweeping trade bill designed to open foreign markets, but only after loading it with provisions that lawmakers said could invite a veto. Repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies, tough trade sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and millions of dollars in new subsidies designed to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain exports were tentatively included. `` We're going to need a trade policy in the next couple of years and I think this is as good as anything that's going to come across the president's desk,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, worked out the details of the central agreement in private in the final hours of negotiations over different versions of the bill passed last year by both houses. The measure erased a provision for driving down unwarranted foreign trade surpluses that had been sponsored by erstwhile Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version prevailed and I think that's unfortunate and I'm against the bill,'' the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman told reporters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration veto threats hovered over the legislation, and some members of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> were disatisified with the bargain worked out between <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. `` My chairman has reached an agreement with Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and has laid it at the feet of the conferees with only a sort of very general discussion and is now winging his way to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. He said that it was uncertain that <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> would be able to sell the package to other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> trade conference committee. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials had been threatening a veto over provisions requiring employers to provide workers with notice of plant closings and the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> sanctions. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said in a statement Thursday night that the plant closing provision and another relating to foreign investment `` clearly would sink the legislation unless they were removed. Thursday afternoon, however, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> appeared to back off a bit, saying that the administration was not trying to signal a veto and still hoped to receive a trade bill that it could sign. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told reporters before leaving on a congressional fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> that he hoped to get sufficient members of the conference committee to sign the final product. `` When you get down to the serious negotiating, something has to lose sometimes and I understand that the administration is disappointed in some of this legislation,'' he said. Final arrangement began to fall into place Thursday morning when one of 17 separate groups of conferees adopted the trade sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> and a subsidiary for selling computerized machinery to the Soviets for the silencing of submarine propellers. The measure would ban <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> equipment for three years. It would bar import of products of the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for three years. In the future, such violations would be punishble by import bans of two to five years. The House had held out for leaving retaliation up to the president but Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, refused to accept that proposal and won out in the end. Another group of conferees broke up without taking action on a proposal by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, to require registration of foreign property ownership in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They said they would wrap up the issue in one final meeting after the spring break. Repeal of the windfall profits tax was a major goal of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is running for reelection this year in a state hammered hard by low oil prices. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the tax in 1979 to when oil prices were soaring. But the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> sent them plunging in 1985 and dried up revenues from the tax. Critics say they want repeal because the tax means costly paperwork. Farm lawmakers, meeting separately, said they were close to agreement on a provision that would put in place export subsidies of up to $ 500 million in 1990 unless negotiators reach agreement by then on phasing out agricultural subsidies under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The so-called triggered marketing loan would benefit producers of wheat, feed grains, soybeans and other oilseed crops. Farm lawmakers also agreed on boosting by $ 1 billion the <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enhancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which furnishes grain companies and others with surplus government crops to induce them to ship American grain overseas. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan would have required the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to roll back `` excess and unwarranted'' foreign trade surpluses by 10 percent annualluy if negotiations failed to do the job. In its place, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> adopted a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal that would require the trade representative to list foreign unfair trade practices and if necessary take action to force trading partners to end them. The agreement between the two also transferred authority to impose retaliatory import curbs from the president to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative _ a step that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had vigorously opposed and which <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> had sought. But it provided authority to waive such retaliation if the cost `` would be substantially out of proportion to the benefits of action.'' The president would retain his authority to decide whether to grant import relief to industries that were hard hit by surges in imports.
