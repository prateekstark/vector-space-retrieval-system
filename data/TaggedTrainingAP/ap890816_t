<HEAD>African Nations Say South Africa Endangers Namibia's Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 African nations on Wednesday appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to foil alleged attempts by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to rig the outcome of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s pre-independence elections in November. The African nations told a special council meeting that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was trying to stop the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, from taking power <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gbeho </PERSON>, called on the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a new resolution giving the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> interim control over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, rather than the South African administrator-general for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. But South African <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearar </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> was the real threat to Namibian independence. In response to criticism of the continued South African presence in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Tuesday it was confining former members of a feared police unit to base for retraining. But <PERSON> Gbeho </PERSON> said it was not good enough to place former members of the <LOCATION> Koevoet </LOCATION> police under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision. He said the veterans, who have been integrated into the South African-led Namibian police, should be fired. <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>'s ambassador also said the proposed election laws are unfair because they allow white South Africans who worked or were born in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to register to vote there. <PERSON> Gbeho </PERSON> also objected to proposed Namibian laws that disqualify those convicted of crimes, including treason and sedition, from voting or being candidates for the constituent assembly. He said these provisions would bar many <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders from running for assembly seats, and prevent <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> activists from voting. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of trying to manipulate November's pre-independence elections, which it is expected to win <PERSON> Shearar </PERSON> said it was a `` great pity'' the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had been convened by the Africans. He said fewer than 2,300 South Africans with Namibian citizenship had registered to vote so far. Up to 700,000 people are expected to vote. <PERSON> Shearar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> poses the true threat to Namibian independence. He said that 1,900 armed <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas entered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> the day the U.N.-backed peace plan went into effect on April 1. Hundreds of guerrillas and dozens of soldiers and police died in subsequent fighting between <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and the South African-led security forces.

<HEAD>State Says Ad To Make Chicago Tourism Boom Shows Too Much Bust</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It may be art, but <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> tourism officials could n't believe their eyes when an ad featuring an <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> watercolor of a nude woman fondling her breasts beckoned Europeans to visit <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Portrayed on the other side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> as home to seamy politics, bluesy music and gangsters, the city has long been viewed as a wide-open town. But this time, city and state officials concurred, someone went too far. `` We think there are a lot greater things that portray <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> better than a nude lady,'' said <PERSON> Avis </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVelle </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` I'm sorry it happened,'' Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said, `` but it was n't our fault.'' Developed for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, Italy-based STZ agency, the ad featuring `` Legacy Nude No. 1'' was part of a 13-week campaign running in the European editions of Newsweek and Time. The campaign touts the city's world-class architecture, museums and business institutions, the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> shoreline, its varied sports and vibrant nightlife. The Vargas painting was used in an ad promoting the city's magazine publishing community and was accompanied by copy inviting Europeans to `` Come to the city where Life was created -LRB- And Playboy, too. -RRB-'' and proclaiming `` A city once famous for its hogs gives birth to a bunny.'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>' famous `` Varga Girl'' paintings appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- which also got its start in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB- and later <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> from the 1930s through the 1960s. His works also are held by a number of private collectors. State officials recognized the <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> painting was art, but they also knew they did n't like it as advertising. `` I do n't like to censor anything, and it was a picture done by a world-famous <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> artist of another time,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` But I thought the ad would be controversial and I did n't want folks talking about the ad. I wanted them talking about <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, so I said no, we are not going to run that.'' State officials subsequently contacted both magazines and directed them not to publish the ad. But a production assistant at Time inadvertently picked up the wrong copy and some 400,000 readers of the magazine's European edition received the unauthorized invitation, according to <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Floriano </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Time officials apologized and agreed not to charge the state for the ad. But <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomcisin </PERSON> suggested the flap was much ado about nothing. `` We started here, we are the best-selling men's magazine in the world and <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>' association with <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> goes back a long way,'' she said. `` I think this whole thing just highlights the discrepancy between what Americans and Europeans find acceptable. `` We sell 5 -LCB- million copies worldwide, and over in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without controversy. In fact,'' she added, `` we're considered kind of tame over there.''

<TEXT>
 After two years of revelations _ and a last-minute prosecution surprise _ <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faces trial on charges of using TV, telephones and the mail to defraud supporters out of millions of dollars. Jury selection in his fraud and conspiracy trial is set for Monday. Opening arguments are to begin one week later and the trial is expected to last at least six weeks, with dozens of witnesses and thousands of documents. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, whose multimillion-dollar evangelical empire crumbled after word leaked about his sexual tryst with a church secretary, is charged in a 24-count indictment with diverting millions in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to support a lavish lifestyle. If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and ordered to pay more than $ 5 million in fines. The case against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resulted from a 16-month federal grand jury investigation into <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, which once boasted $ 129 million in revenue under his leadership. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former top aide at the now-bankrupt television ministry and former co-defendant, agreed on Aug. 8 to plead guilty to four counts and to testify against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, one count of wire fraud by telephone, one count of wire fraud by television and one count of conspiracy. `` It's got to have some effect -LRB- on the approach taken at trial -RRB-,'' one of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said of <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s testimony. `` But these kind of people who make these kinds of pleas are not always considered as credible as they might be.'' The <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> trial follows the tax evasion convictions of two former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aides, brothers <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, in the same federal courtroom. The Taggarts' attorney, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, said his clients would consider testifying against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s personal aide, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, his former interior designer, are scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 25 _ three days opening arguments in <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s trial. The Taggarts each face 25 years in prison and more than $ 1 million in fines when they are sentenced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, who also will preside over the upcoming <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> trial. They were convicted July 25. It's been more than two years since <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, following revelations about his sexual encounter with secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and hush money paid to her by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. The story broke in March 1987. Disclosures about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s extravagant spending habits on homes, cards and jewelry, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings, and charges of homosexuality by former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> associates touched off an unprecedented `` holy war'' among some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most prominent televangelists, including <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. The federal grand jury heard testimony from more than 100 witnesses, reviewed thousands of documents and watched tapes of old `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' shows. Its Dec. 5 indictment came almost eight years to the day after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> had sex in a <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, hotel room _ Dec. 6, 1980. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> was accused of giving her $ 265,000 in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money in exchange for her silence. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Specifically, he is accused of pocketing some of the $ 158 million that poured into <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987 under various `` lifetime partnership'' programs. In eight of the 11 programs, contributors were promised free lodging at the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> retreat near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> in exchange for a one-time donation of $ 1,000 or more. Instead of using all of the money to build hotels and other facilities at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the indictment said, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives spent more than $ 4 million on themselves and used some of it for operating expenses. All the while, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> was suffering from severe cash-flow problems as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received nearly $ 3.5 million in bonuses from 1984 through 1987 and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> got $ 550,000 in bonuses. At the same time, they withheld informaton about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s worsening financial problems from its board of directors, the indictment charged. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was not charged. Prosecutors <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who works in the fraud section of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> have declined to discuss details of the upcoming trial. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his defense attorneys also are mum, saying they believe it will be impossible to get a fair trial in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> because of extensive pretrial publicity, particularly in The Charlotte Observer. The newspaper won a Pulitizer Prize last year for its investigative stories about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership. He resigned when the Observer's editors told him they were prepared to go to print with a story spelling out the details of the sex-and-money scandal. Defense attorneys failed in their attempts to move the trial out of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the judge has said he believes it's possible to select a fair jury `` And if that's true, I ca n't think of anything we're more anxious to do than to go to trial,'' he said.

<HEAD>Quebec Separatist Issue Back in Canadian Politics</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A public opinion poll has thrust the issue of Quebec independence back into the Canadian political arena, although Quebeckers rejected separatism in a referendum nearly a decade ago. The Gallup poll indicated that 28 percent of Canadians believe French-speaking <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> should become an independent country. According to Gallup, it was the strongest support for separatism nationally since the company's pollsters first asked the question more than 20 years ago. Perhaps the most startling finding of the poll of 1,034 Canadians was that 27 percent of English-speaking Canadians and 36 percent of French-speaking Canadians favored <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s becoming a separate nation. There long has been resentment in parts of English-speaking <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, especially in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, of what is perceived as favoritism or special treatment for Quebec. But the percentage of those who would just as soon see it separate from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had not been perceived to be as high as the poll indicated. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, brushed the poll findings aside. `` The heartbeat of the nation is strong, it's vigorous and it's resolved to even greater unity,'' he said `` It's kind of silly to ask Canadians whether they want to divide their country or to strip their country. The answer, when you strip away the varnish, is absolutely ` no.''' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> conceded that some linguistic tensions exist in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but said that always has been the case. Indeed, a focus in the Canadian news media on the national unity issue may be as much a result of a languid summer without much else attracting attention as to any concrete developments in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, who opposes separatism, appears virtually certain to win the election expected in early fall, possibly with an even greater margin of victory for his provincial <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> than in 1985 when it won 99 of 122 seats in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> legislature. The <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION>, which found success with its separatist message in the 1970s, has fallen on hard times, and the economic prosperity that has lasted in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> along with most of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for seven years makes this an unlikely time for a comeback. Quebec, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest and second most populous province with 6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking. No one is predicting a new surge of the separatist movement. The poll results were a reminder of how intractable the French-English issues are in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the difficulties of running a country in which nine provinces are majority English-speaking and one French-speaking. Among those expessing unease, however, was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the retiring leader of the naional <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which sits in opposition to <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Progressive Conservatives. `` I have, during the course of the last six or nine months, experienced and felt a deterioration in the mood of the country,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` I believe all those who share with me the view of a tolerant, bilingual federation working in equilibrium should be concerned.'' Quebec barely surfaced as an issue in the national election this past November when the big issue was the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s victory allowed the pact to take effect as scheduled Jan. 1, and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> was a center of support for the agreement and its native son. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Progressive Conservatives do not run in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s provincial elections. But the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> government's refusal last winter to remove its restrictions on bilingual signs despite a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> decision touched off resentment among the province's English minority and in English-speaking provinces. French is required throughout <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as the only language on most outdoor signs. There also has been growing realization that the <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION>, a constitutional agreement recognizing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as a `` distinct society,'' may not make its deadline on June 23 for ratification by all 10 provinces. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast province of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in the West have yet to ratify the agreement, and threats have been made to reconsider ratification elsewhere before the deadline. The Meech Lake Accord developed because <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> had refused to join the nine other provinces in signing the national constitution at the outset of the decade. The constitution still applies to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> even without its signature, but the impasse makes it more difficult for changes to be made on such national issues as native rights and the way the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> operates. <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> voters rejected sovereignty in a 1980 referendum after a dizzying decade in which power shifted from the English minority to the French majority. The <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> governed the province from 1976 to 1985 but lost its spirit after 60 percent of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s voters in the 1980 referendum rejected separation.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After five months of day and night shelling by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been abandoned by 90 percent of its people. It is a living hell for those who still huddle in its ruins. `` We're living like rats underground, hiding in fear in shelters for endless days and nights,'' lamented <PERSON> Salwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashkar </PERSON>, a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> woman who runs a beauty parlor in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't take much more.'' Across the capital's dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, a moonscape of devastated apartment blocks infested by snipers, life is as desperate for the Moslems as well as the Christians. `` We're going down the drain,'' said <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shami </PERSON>, an engineering graduate from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> who has no job and no future. `` I'm trying to get out. Anywhere. I'll go to any country that will give me a visa,'' said <PERSON> Shami </PERSON>, 24. Hospitals are running out of medicine. There's no electricity or water. The presidential palace atop a hill overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, like most buildings, has been blasted into rubble. Packs of stray dogs, their ribs poking through their sides, scavenge through the piles of fly-infested garbage in the streets. Rats, some as big as cats, scamper through the stinking mounds that lie feastering in the summer heat on nearly every alley corner. Beneath the rubble-strewn streets, where power cables cut by shrapnel dangle from splintered wooden poles, the estimated 150,000 Beirutis who cling to what is left of their lives cower for days on end in underground bunkers or basement parking lots from the bombardment. Apartment building tenants crowd ground-floor entrances to cook whatever they have on makeshift stoves. Housewives hand out the meager fare. The men venture out when they can to forage wood or anything that will burn. There is nothing but despair. After 14 years of civil war, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> invasion and murderous street battles between rival militias, surviving one day to the next is all Beirutis can expect. The capital's radio stations cut into programs to report which areas are being hit _ in between commercial breaks with bouncy jingles advertising scotch or hairsprays that seem grotesquely out of place. The police, who long ago lost all hope of maintaining law and order in a country that seemed bent on self-destruction, chronicle <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s daily disasters with painstaking dedication. They estimate that more than 1.3 million of the 1.5 million people who lived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before the latest spasm of fighting between the Christians and the Syrians broke out March 8 have fled the city. Every day in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, when the shelling eases, people emerge from the bunkers, load up cars and pickups with whatever they can carry, and head south. Some find shelter with relatives. But tens of thousands have to camp out along the coastal highway as they did when they fled the Israeli siege of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1982. They sleep in their cars or under plastic sheets. For miles along the highway, these refugees in their own land squat beside the road, listening to the rumble of shellfire to the north ripping their city apart. In east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Christians are not so lucky. Their 310-square-mile enclave, shrunken after years of defeats in the civil war, is ringed to the north, south and east by the Syrians and their allies. The only way out is by sea, past a Syrian blockade on ships bound for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Not everyone makes it. A Christian couple lost their two daughters a few nights ago when Syrian shellfire hit the speedboat ferrying them to a Norwegian-owned hydrofoil, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, that sneaks in at night. The parents were separated when they were pulled from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>'s crew. Both thought the other had the children. It was n't until they reached the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> hours later that they bumped into each other and learned their children had been killed. Many Christians had fled to the comparative safety of ski resorts of <LOCATION> Faraya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harajel </PERSON> and Ashkout in the pine-studded central mountains. But it it expensive: A two-room apartment rents for about $ 1,800 a month. Some Beirutis have stuck it out. Some have nowhere to go. Some have no money to get out. Some have just given up and wait for the end. <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON>, the Armenian who has had a barber shop in the basement of the Commodore Hotel for 15 years, is still there. He used to have hundreds of customers a month, sipping scotch as he clipped their hair. Now he's lucky if he gets a dozen. His best customers in the ruined hotel, once headquarters for the foreign press, are the 30 Syrian soldiers billeted there. If he's lucky, they sometimes leave a tip `` Mostly they do n't bother paying,'' he said. `` What can I do? There's nowhere for me to go anymore.'' The Christians, paralyzed by a fuel shortage because of the blockade, line up at gas stations. Gas canisters for cooking cost about $ 21. In more peaceful times they cost $ 1. In the Moslem sector, fuel is more plentiful, although still scarce. Oil and gas are brought in from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, but even that's becoming risky because the Christians are shelling the mountain roads used by Syrian convoys <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s cafes and restaurants, once the haunt of high-rolling Arab sheiks and their bejeweled women, are closed: no customers, no power, no water. A few bistros open briefly during lulls along rubble-strewn <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the main commercial thoroughfare that once bustled with life. But few risk sitting down for a coffee when a shell could blow them away at any minute. Along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s corniche, the Syrians have set up artillery guns that shell the Christian side across the bay. They have become a favorite target for Christian gunners, which makes for dangerous living in the apartment blocks lining the corniche. Government offices, banks, businesses are closed. What was left of the government system after years of fighting has ceased to function. No one is being paid. Schools have been closed for months. Parents teach children at home, often in the shelters during shelling. Central Bank Governor <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> lives in the building's underground bunker and refuses to answer the telephone _ even when it is functioning _ because the bank is n't operating Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> huddles in his bunker two floors below the presidential palace, which has been demolished by Syrian shellfire. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the two-story, 35-room complex has been hit by 10 240mm mortar rounds, designed to knock out army bunkers, and scores of 180mm shells. `` They try every day to blow us away, but we're still here,'' he said.

The party is led by <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> who is from the largest clan among the 200,000-strong Druse community. The Progressive Socialists have about 100 Soviet-made tanks and 4,000 hardcore fighters but can field up to 12,000. The party has been fighting alongside the Syrians.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HEZBOLLAH _ The <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> is </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s main Shiite rival and seeks an Iranian-style Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It controls <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums. The Iranian-backed party, formed in 1982, has some 3,500 fighters. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the umbrella group for extremist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It has declared support for the Syrian units in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but has not joined the battle.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE MOURABITOUN _ The main militia force of the Sunni Moslems before it was smashed by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, aided by the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>, in April 1985. It has gone underground since then, leaving the <LOCATION> Sunnis </LOCATION> without any significant militia force.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LEBANESE ARMY _ It has been fractured along sectarian lines. The mainly Christian units, with an estimated 20,000 men, are led by army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. His three combat brigades are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trained and equipped with U.S.-built tanks and artillery.

The right-wing force has some 6,000 fighters and thousands more reservists. The force has pro-Israeli leanings and is well armed with tanks and artillery. In the past year it has received an estimated 120 tanks plus armored personnel carriers and 155mm artillery from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe. The Lebanese Forces are <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s only backers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

They include some 1,000 fighters from the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, headed by former Syrian army Capt. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, and Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 SYRIAN TROOPS _ They first entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 as part of an Arab League peacekeeping force. The non-Syrian units soon pulled out. The Syrians initially sought to curb Moslem factions, but wound up fighting the Christians in later years. The Syrians, with more than two divisions _ about 40,000 troops with hundreds of tanks and heavy artillery _ in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, control about 70 percent of Lebanese territory. They are blocking all land exits from the 310-square-mile Christian heartland.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE <LOCATION> SOUTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> LEBANON </LOCATION> ARMY _ Supported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army is mainly Christian and holds a salient around the mountain town of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ISRAEL </LOCATION> _ It maintains about 1,000 troops, with armor and artillery, in the buffer zone carved out when the Israelis withdrew the bulk of their army from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985, three years after it invaded that country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> IRAN </LOCATION> _ It has some 2,000 men from the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They moved in to fight the invading Israelis in 1982. They have not been involved in the latest fighting, although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has declared support for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s first female <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice was named to the bench just this week, no matter what the National Women's Political Caucus directory says. The organization listed Chief Justice <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> as one of the women holding top elective offices around the country, in its National Directory of Women Elected Officials. Trouble is, <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> is a man. His first name, French for <PERSON> John </PERSON>, has been Anglicized. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said his name has n't caused him problems in recent years, but he recalled receiving written invitations to join sororities when he was in college. `` I once knew a guy named <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, but I never knew a boy called Sue,'' he joked Monday. The women's caucus will be able to cite one female justice on the state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in its next directory, though.

 Hundreds of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> faithful walked with candles up a winding quarter-mile driveway to his former mansion Tuesday night to pass the singer's grave and mark the 12th anniversary of his death. The crowd walked single file and carried candles lit from an eternal flame at the mansion, called Graceland. Many left single roses at Presley's graveside beside the swimming pool. The rock' n' roll pioneer died Aug. 16, 1977 `` He just had everything,'' said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, who waited on a sidewalk for 13 hours to be first in line for the procession. `` He had looks. He had charisma. He had everything.'' The candlelight vigil, expected to draw more than 4,000 participants through the night, is the largest single event of a nine-day lineup of concerts, memorials, trivia contests, film festivals and souvenir fairs that make up Elvis International Tribute Week. The 7-year-old Tribute Week is organized and promoted by managers of <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s former residence, Graceland, which draws 650,000 visitors a year, including some 40,000 over the anniversary celebration, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Soden </PERSON>, executive director of the Graceland division of <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The vigil was begun 11 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, one of more than 250 Presley fan clubs around the world. <PERSON> Georgann </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, president of the Elvis Country club, said her group has more than 1,200 members worldwide, many of whom are too young to have been Presley fans when he was alive. She said she expects the annual graveside vigils to continue for years to come. `` One reason for a fan club is to pass the torch, to keep the candle burning,'' she said. Ms. Cousins, 38, of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said her daylong wait to be first in line was worth it. It was the third year in a row that she and her friend-in-Elvis <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fordin </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, have been at the front of the procession. Graceland and its 36,000-square-foot souvenir shopping center take in about $ 12 million a year. The complex is run for the financial benefit of Presley's only child, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. Tickets to tour the house, two of <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s former airplanes and a museum of his cars and motorcycles cost $ 15.95 each for adults and $ 10.25 for children. A tour of the house alone is $ 7.50. Presley bought the three-story, white-columned residence in 1957 when his rock' n' roll career began to blossom, and he called <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> home for most of his professional life. Presley died at age 42 of heart disease.

<HEAD>Marathon Trial Is `Cottage Industry Event' in Bloated Justice System</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

 A defense attorney sees the McMartin preschool molestation trial as `` a cottage industry event'' and legal experts say its protracted length is symptomatic of a bloated, unworkable justice system. With the trial in its third year and the charges against <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> and his mother 6 years old, the <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case has set records in criminal law. And it's not over yet. In April, the trial became the longest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, surpassing the two-year record of the Hillside Strangler case. Its cost was estimated recently at $ 15 million and climbing. `` This trial has become a cottage industry event,'' said <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> `` It made experts out of people who testified. It became an annuity for attorneys. It has regularly been a ratings focus for television. ... Lots of carpet baggers glom on and make hay.'' The chief prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, says that although <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> is the longest trial it's not that unusual. `` I would say that in many respects the <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case is like other cases that take much too long to go through the system and come to a conclusion,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> blames the defense for the trial's length, citing interminable cross-examinations. She says 80 percent of the 14 months she spent presenting her case was taken up by defense inquiries. The defense blames the prosecution. `` <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> is a case that may have been doomed to excesses,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says. `` It started in excess. Its core defect was numbers _ numbers of counts, numbers of defendants, numbers of children. Whatever you think of guilt or innocence, there was no necessity to bring such a large case.'' It began with <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s arrest in 1983 and escalated to include six other teachers at the prestigious McMartin Pre-school in the seaside community of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Prosecutors alleged that <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, his mother, sister, grandmother and three other women teachers had molested hundreds of tots at the school over five years. But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> dropped charges against five of the defendants, saying there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, now 31, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 62, were left to face trial on 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy involving alleged molestation of 11 children. Since the trial began in April 1987, the jury of 12 with a backup panel of six alternates has been dwindling due to illness and employment problems. With only one alternate left, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> worries that the case will be aborted if more jurors are lost. A jury of 12 is required to decide a criminal case. `` It is a probability this case will end in a mistrial,'' <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said recently, vowing to do everything he can to avert that. He has limited defense witnesses and lengthened the trial day to six hours. Attorneys hope to submit the case to jurors this year. `` The system ca n't survive too many more McMartins because it's so long and expensive,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Aranella </PERSON>, professor of criminal law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <PERSON> Aranella </PERSON> suggests that the time and money consumed by such a case reduces the chance for other defendants to receive trials. In order to work, he said, the system must rely on plea bargaining to dispose of 80 percent to 90 percent of criminal prosecutions. `` The adversarial trial system is too time consuming, cumbersome and expensive to provide to every criminal defendant,'' he said. `` That's a fact of life that every actor in the criminal justice system understands.'' `` The irony,'' <PERSON> Aranella </PERSON> says, `` is that as long as the system can rely on plea bargaining to settle the majority of criminal prosecutions, we can go on for a long time with these occasional show trials.'' The national trend is toward longer and longer trials, says <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alschuler </PERSON>, professor of law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> who calls the length of the <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case `` incomprehensible.'' `` American trials are just ridiculously too long with the result that we do n't give them to everyone,'' he said. `` We pressure almost all defendants into plea bargains.'' <PERSON> Alschuler </PERSON>, citing legal history, says trials have been growing in length for the last century. `` I think it was the late 18th century when the first criminal trial lasted longer than a day,'' he said. `` ... It's been a gradual process of increasing trial complexity.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> thinks that <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> will lead to reforms with legislators moving to limit the length of jury selection and preliminary hearings. But <PERSON> Alschuler </PERSON> sees little chance for reform. `` This is a great system for lawyers, and lawyers control the criminal justice system,'' <PERSON> Alschuler </PERSON> said. `` It's not a great system for defendants and taxpayers. But, by <PERSON> God </PERSON>, it's a great system for lawyers.''

<TEXT>
 Relations between Roman Catholics and Jews have suffered new setbacks that threaten long-term efforts aimed at mending centuries of mistrust and misunderstanding. Officials on both sides are appealing for moderation to deal with the disputes involving a Roman Catholic convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s recent remarks about God's covenant with the Jews, in which he said history showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had not always been faithful to God's law. While expressing anger and disappointment, Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said relations with the church have improved substantially since the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, and they want to continue the interfaith dialogue. `` Our relations have to overcome 2,000 years of misunderstanding,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klenicki </PERSON>, director of interfaith affairs of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the group's liaison representative to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't do it in 20 years What is crucial is to continue the dialogue and the relationship.'' It has been a bumpy relationship during the 10 -LCB- - year papacy of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> Rabbi <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanenbaum </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultations </ORGANIZATION>, said relations have gone `` two steps forward, one step backward.'' The steps forward included <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main synagogue in 1986, the first recorded visit by a pope to a Jewish shrine, and his talks with a delegation of American Jews in 1987. A step backward was the pope's meeting at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1982 with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Then came the pope's audience in 1987 with Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, accused of complicity in Nazi war crimes. The Holocaust has been a particular source of friction. Jews and others have questioned whether <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> did enough during World War II to stop <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s campaign to exterminate the Jews. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was criticized for not mentioning Jewish victims during his 1988 visit to the <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, although a few weeks later he spoke of the `` particular measure of extermination'' suffered by Jews. In a 1987 papal letter released in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Christians `` approach with fearsome respect the terrifying experience of the extermination ... suffered by the Jews'' during the war. Still, some Jewish groups say the pope has not gone far enough and that he treats the Holocaust as not exclusively a Jewish tragedy. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, a Holocaust survivor and author, recently accused <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of trying to `` de-Judaize'' the Holocaust by ignoring Jewish suffering in speeches and comments about that era. The Holocaust is at the root of the latest dispute, which involves a Carmelite convent at <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a few feet from the fence surrounding the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian symbols, such as a 23-foot cross, offend the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died there. Under an accord signed by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders in 1987, the nuns were supposed to have moved by Feb. 22 to a prayer center to be built several thousand yards away. The deadline passed, and the center has yet to be built. Jewish groups accused the Polish church of reneging. `` What was supposed to be and should have been a discreet and loving gesture of conciliation and reconciliation, because of delays has become a stumbling block on the path of Jewish-Catholic relations,'' said <PERSON> Tullia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON>, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities and a signatory to the 1987 accord. After a series of demonstrations at the convent by American Jewish activists, Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> announced Aug. 10 he was suspending the agreement to move the nuns. He blamed Western Jewish groups for launching `` a violent campaign of accusations and slanders'' and creating an `` atmosphere of aggressive demands.'' Many Jews want the pope to intervene. The pope himself sparked a controversy with his remarks during two recent general audiences about God's covenant with <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION>. On Aug. 2, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said God selected Jews as the chosen people `` on condition that they remained faithful to his law.'' `` But the history of the Old Testament shows many instances of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s infidelity to God,'' he said. `` Hence God sent the Prophets as his messengers to call the people to conversion, to warn them of their hardness of heart and to foretell a new covenant still to come.'' The Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith protested, expressing `` profound concern'' at the comments and said it hoped the `` clock of Catholic-Jewish relations has not been tragically set back.'' The group said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s remarks suggested the new covenant with Christianity had replaced and superseded the alliance with Jews, who believe that God's covenant with them is everlasting. Jewish leaders said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s remarks contradicted the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s 1965 document Nostra Aetate -LRB- In Our Times -RRB-, which officially rescinded the accusation that the Jews killed Christ. That document is considered a turning point in Catholic-Jewish relations. The Rev. Pier <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumagalli </PERSON>, an official of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s office for relations with Jews, confirmed he received the Anti-Defamation League's letter of protest and said it would be studied Otherwise, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has not commented publicly on the issue.

The lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said false statements about <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>'s business dealings and professional competency were made in the Aug. 11, 1986, issue of the magazine published by <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` He was the featured cover article in a national publication, he was held up to ridicule and scorn, he was accused falsely of ruining the company and he lost his position at the company as a direct result of this and follow-up articles,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dort </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, said Tuesday.

 The crowd was smaller, the musicians amateur and Saabs replaced sandals as the favored form of transportation, but hundreds of people donned tie-dyed shirts to conjure the spirit of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> anyway. Twenty years after <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> <PERSON> Havens </PERSON> opened the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> festival before 400,000 people, the late <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s old farm filled with revelers Tuesday to celebrate one of rock' n' roll's most sacred anniversaries. `` It was a deeply spiritual experience and certainly people would want to come back,'' said comedian <PERSON> Wavy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravy </PERSON>, the only one of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'s original performers. Gravy, wearing a beanie with a propeller and carrying a walking stick topped with a pig's snout, waved to festival veterans before being ushered into a forest of satellite dishes for one of dozens of interviews. More free enterprise than free love was evident at the upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meadow as tourists could choose between T-shirts emblazoned with `` I survived the Woodstock Reunion'' and `` Was I Late?'' `` I really honor the people whose spread this is for allowing this to take place,'' <PERSON> Gravy </PERSON> said. `` It's very folksy.'' It was n't without a price. A man who said he was a relative of the field's new owners, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> and <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, asked a $ 5 `` field restoration'' donation from each carload. Police said the owners squabbled with merchants who tried to sell their wares. True to the spirit of the original <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, when fans swarmed over fences to transform it into a free concert, some motorists just waited until the landlord looked the other way and snuck their vehicles onto the field. Police were on hand to make sure traffic kept moving. There were no arrests, said Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He estimated the crowd at about 600, the largest of a celebration that had been building for a week. The most tension came when television reporters, nervously approaching 6 p.m. deadlines, competed for space near the commemorative plaque that is the only permanent fixture on the alfalfa field. `` I did n't really know what to expect,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, a resident of upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who said he attended the original show and has returned every year since. `` I'm just thankful that they let us go back.

 An Indian reservation sounded like a good home for a buffalo herd, but the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> tribe wishes someone would take them away. `` We do n't want a herd of buffalo,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Monette </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> tribal councilman. `` Unfortunately, we got stuck with a herd of buffalo, and we do n't know what to do with them.'' Feeding the herd is costing the tribe about $ 100 a week and will become more expensive come winter, he said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gave the herd to the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation under a program that distributes surplus animals to reservations. The herd has grown from nine head in 1984 to 29. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> claims the tribe is trying to cut expenses by starving the buffalo. `` To see them starve like that is a horrible thing,'' she said. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, who ran a game farm before selling her animals to the <ORGANIZATION> Minot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, said she offered to buy the buffalo to show the tribe how extreme she thinks the situation is. But she said she does n't really want them because she too is daunted by feed costs. <PERSON> Monette </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Twila </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin-Kekahbah </PERSON> deny the buffalo are starving. `` They cost some money to the tribe, which we really ca n't afford,'' <PERSON> Martin-Kekahbah </PERSON> said `` However, the buffalo are not starving. Some believe the buffalo are better taken care of than the membership.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>, caretaker for the buffalo, said the animals usually are fed between 15 gallons to 30 gallons of ground barley a day. The tribe also buys 80 to 90 bales of hay a year for the herd, he said, and provides a barrel of canned food supplement and a salt block. The herd also has a large spring-fed water hole, he said. `` I think they are fed better than a lot of places,'' <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON> said. Complaints from people like <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> may stem from a misunderstanding about how buffalo should look, he said. `` A person has to get pretty close to them to see what shape they are in,'' he said. <PERSON> Monette </PERSON> said the tribe is asking for suggestions on how it might reduce the herd to a manageable size, possibly by auctioning or donating animals.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Considering Tax Benefits for Savers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, seeking ways to boost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate to cure a variety of economic ills, appears to be inching closer to recommending increased tax incentives for thrifty Americans. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> added her support to the idea Tuesday, saying that expanding Individual Retirement Accounts would make her job of reducing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge trade deficits easier. Millions of American savers could benefit through expanded IRAs, which enjoyed great popularity earlier in the decade, but it could cost the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> billions of dollars in lost tax revenue. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, in an interview with reporters, stressed that she was not signaling an imminent administration announcement on IRAs. However, other officials said a proposed increase in tax incentives for IRAs is high on the list of options being studied by the administration. Americans' personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increased only slightly to 4.2 percent last year. By contrast, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the country with the world's largest trade surplus, had a savings rate of 16.5 percent in 1987. Administration officials said they are planning a fall campaign, to be led by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, focusing on the country's chronic low savings rate and proposing ways to correct the problem. The huge cost of IRAs was one reason they were greatly scaled back by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. As a result, the number of tax returns claiming <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deductions fell from 15.5 million in 1987 to 7.4 million last year. In endorsing increased tax incentives for IRAs, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said it would `` highlight the great need for private savings to go up. It sends up a flag saying, this is very important, not only to your nation, but to your own future and to your children.'' A key reason advanced for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s high trade deficits is the fact that Americans consume more than the country can produce domestically. Economists argue that if Americans can be persuaded to cut back consumption and save more, it would limit the need for foreign goods. A higher savings rate would expand the pool of available funds in this country and lower the cost of borrowing by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses, making them more competitive internationally. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is negotiating with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for the Japanese to lower trade barriers erected against foreign goods. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said cutting the federal budget deficit, which drains away savings, and efforts to boost personal savings would counter Japanese arguments that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not doing enough at home to fix its trading problems. In recent weeks, Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> have issued their own warnings about the need to increase the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> attacked <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` cultural now-now-ism,'' which he defined as an unrestrained appetite for satisfying immediate wants at the expense of long-term goals. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the month, called raising the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate `` the crucial issue for the long-term economic outlook of the country.'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> is holding negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in an effort to get those nations to lower trade barriers cited by the administration in May in a `` hit list'' of the most harmful impediments to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade. The administration is holding separate talks with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on so-called structural impediments that keep foreign companies from doing business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, such as the Japanese distribution system. However, she warned that despite the administration's best efforts, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit is likely to widen `` a little'' in the next 18 months because the dollar has increased in value, making <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods less competitive on overseas markets.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is engaging the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in a mild war of words over attempts by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity trade union to form a non-communist government in that Soviet bloc country. `` Questions involving the government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are properly an internal affair,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Tuesday. He was using a diplomatic formula that recalled the flavor but not the intensity of 1980-81, when Solidarity last challenged the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, leading to martial law. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda warned that efforts by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to form a non-communist government were `` against the principles of parliamentary democracy'' and `` could lead to a prolonged political crisis.'' `` The opposition has changed its strategy and has taken the course of an immediate seizure of power,'' Pravda said. The commentary noted that fixing the Polish economy required a coalition of political forces, including the communists. The commentary contrasted with recent Soviet media reports on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Soviet television recently broadcast neutral coverage of such Solidarity leaders as <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, and highlighted a visit last month by filmmaker <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>, a Solidarity supporter and member of parliament who served as a judge in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Film Festival. An independent Washington-based analyst, <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON>, said the Soviet commentary `` means that they are trying to send a message to the government and to Solidarity that things have gone far enough.'' `` The Soviets have given the countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> a free hand over the past few years, but they may be reassessing that policy,'' said <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and author of the book, `` Eastern European Fault Lines.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communists, he said, `` would like to lure Solidarity into a coalition'' to share blame for the deteriorating economy and soaring prices, but do not want to surrender power, especially of military and security forces. Solidarity leaders, on the other hand, are coming under pressure from rank-and-file supporters to take advantage of elections this year that shattered the communists' hold on parliament. But Solidarity is wary of sharing power with the communists and taking the fall for continuing economic and political problems, said <PERSON> Bugajski </PERSON>. Soviet leaders worry that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ultimately may leave the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION>, but know that a 1981-style military crackdown would jeopardize the efforts of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to improve relations with the West and reform the Soviet system. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> continued to jockey with communist authorities over who should lead the government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was willing to serve as prime minister `` if society wants it.'' And Polish President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> called for a joint meeting soon of the country's major political leaders to find a `` rational solution'' for the deepening governmental crisis. In an interview with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> radio Polish service, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> issued an assurance clearly aimed at assuaging <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> fears, saying that changes in the Polish government would `` not represent a threat to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> declined to comment directly on the Pravda article, but said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` note that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> faces a difficult period of transition from a state dominated by one party to a more pluralistic and democratic system.'' `` This process must be managed within <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> itself. The formation of a new Polish government is an internal matter for the Polish people to decide. We hope that a new government will be formed as soon as possible,'' he said. Another <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as `` very delicate,'' but said that the Soviet warning was not viewed with great alarm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It was not even as strong as a shot across the bow,'' said the source. A third government source, also speaking on condition that he not be further identified, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials did not think it likely that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would choose or be forced by conservatives in his country to order a crackdown in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the near future.

<HEAD>Americans Get Rare Chance to See Total Lunar Eclipse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The moon plunges into the Earth's shadow tonight, creating the first total lunar eclipse visible in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since 1982, and thousands of telescopes are awaiting a celestial show of light and color. The eclipse will start at 8:23 p.m. EDT when the Earth's shadow appears to take its first nip from the full moon, and will end about 5 -LCB- hours later. The last full lunar eclipse visible over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was in December 1982, and the next one will not occur until December 1992. If the skies are clear, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> residents will get the best view. The moon will be overhead with twilight ending just as the eclipse begins. In time zones farther west, the eclipse will start before sunset and moonrise, cheating some Americans out of seeing the full lunar show. None of the eclipse will be visible in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Moonrise in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for example, will be at 7:43 p.m. CDT, half an hour after the eclipse has started. Even more of the eclipse will take place below the horizon from the perspective of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The moon will not become visible until sometime after 8:30 p.m. PDT,'' according to a statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and will be in eclipse as it rises. `` This a rare event,'' said an observatory official. `` The last time the moon rose while totally eclipsed as seen from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was on Feb. 5, 1841, and it will not rise while totally eclipsed again as seen from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> until June 25, 2029.'' Free telescopes have been set up at the <LOCATION> Griffith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION> for public viewing of the event. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, several local astronomical societies are staging an eclipse-watching party with free use of telescopes. The first glimpse the Texans will get of the moon will be about 7:55 p.m. CDT when it already is eclipsing. `` Moon Watch II,'' a free outdoor celebration of the eclipse and the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11's lunar landing, will be held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Central Park. A small rocket will be launched to open the event, followed by lectures on the eclipse and live entertainment featuring a dance called `` Moon Beams II.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, astronomer <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> plans to fire a laser beam at the moon during the darkest part of the eclipse. He hopes the light will strike a reflector left on the moon in 1971 by the Apollo 15 astronauts. If his aim is good, a small bit of the laser light will bounce back, almost a quarter million miles, and be detected by telescopes at the observatory. Usually, <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said, the experiment is n't attempted during a full moon because the natural light is too bright to see the reflected laser beam. But when the full moon is eclipsed, the returned beam can be spotted. `` It provides us an opportunity to range -LRB- fire the laser -RRB- in a period we usually do n't even try,'' said <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>. `` This gives us an opportunity to sample a portion of the -LRB- moon's -RRB- orbit we do n't normally get. By clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laser to the moon and then back to the McDonald telescopes, scientists are able to precisely measure the distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its moon. <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said astronomers have discovered that the moon is moving away from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> at the rate of about 2 inches a year. The mean distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and moon is about 230,000 miles. Observatories from coast to coast are expected to spend at least some time observing the event. Cloudy skies, of course, could spoil eclipse-viewing plans at any point. And the outlook was not good for much of the East. Forecasts for today and tonight along the east coast called for thunderstorms. Observers may have better luck in the central and western areas where the forecasts generally were for clear to partly cloudy skies. With good local weather, some phase of the spectacle should be visible to about a billion observers. The moon will eclipse within view of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. A lunar eclipse occurs when the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> passes through the shadow created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its orbit of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, usually passes above or below this shadowline, but it occasionally follows a path that shades it completely for a time, an event called a total eclipse. During an eclipse, the moon can appear to be a bright coppery red if there is a clean air between the lunar surface and the observer on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon can dim to an faint orange color or even fade from view altogether.

 Syrian troops pounded the Christian enclave from all sides Tuesday and mobilized militia allies in apparent preparation for an all-out assault on the besieged area. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, assembled in an emergency session by the secretary-general under a rarely used article of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter, called late Tuesday for an immediate truce in the 14-year-old civil war and Arab League mediation. The 15 nations in the council `` urgently appeals to all the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and all shelling on land and at sea,'' said Algerian Ambassador <PERSON> Hocine </PERSON> <PERSON> Djoudi </PERSON>, the council president. `` It further appeals to all parties to observe a total and immediate cease-fire,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> declaration read by <PERSON> Djoudi </PERSON> said. Christian forces, greatly outnumbered by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers, fought Syrian troops with tanks and artillery along the southern, eastern and northern edges of the 310-square-mile enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners also hammered the 28-mile-long Christian coastline, the Christians' only escape route. Police said 19 people were killed and 99 wounded in fighting. By police count, 760 people have been killed and 2,045 wounded since the battles began March 8. Casualties Tuesday included two young girls killed when a Syrian shell hit their home in the Christian port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and a Moslem woman who was eight months pregnant. Doctors at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Makassed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the baby survived. The Syrians, who were reported massing troops and tanks in the mountains, appeared to be trying to stretch Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian fighters, who number 20,000 to the Syrians' 40,000 <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> urged the 22,000 Moslem soldiers in the fractured army to join the Christians. `` The hour of unification has struck,'' he said on the radio. `` Our reunion is essential to reunite the partitioned homeland and defeat the enemy.'' The poorly equipped Moslem soldiers have largely stayed out the fighting and were not expected to go against the powerful Syrians. International pressure was building for a cease-fire. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, his voice shaking with emotion, said from <LOCATION> Castelgondolfo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>: `` In the name of God, I turn to the Syrian authorities, asking them to stop the bombardment that aims to destroy ... the whole country.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called the emergency <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting Tuesday after none of the 15 council members took any lead in the issue, and hours later the declaration prepared by the Algerian ambassador that called for peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was unanimously adopted. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter allows the secretary-general to call such meetings when situations are deemed to threaten international security. The last meeting of its type was held in 1979 after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. The Syrians summoned their Moslem and leftist <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia leaders to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for a council of war in what appeared to be a move to escalate the campaign against the Christians. The leaders of 16 factions, including Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups and radical Palestinian guerrillas, attended. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Damascus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> pledged that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> `` will be defeated not by the Syrian army, but by the nationalist and Moslem forces.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s tactic in recent years has been to use its militia allies to do most of the ground fighting while Syrian artillery and armor provide support, giving <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> room for diplomatic maneuvering. Until the last few days, most militias had stayed stayed out of the fighting. <PERSON> Assem </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanso </PERSON>, leader of the Lebanese chapter of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said after the meeting: `` We shall fight a decisive battle with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and we shall foil the plots he is hatching.'' The duels began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the army commander and head of a Christian government vying for power with a Moslem Cabinet, blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the Syrians had expanded the confrontation to cover all the Christian enclave in an apparent effort to shatter <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and deplete their stocks of ammunition. He said the Syrian move was `` in apparent preparation for a new offensive against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s defenses.'' A Syrian attempt to storm the Christians' strategic Souk el-Gharb garrison on Sunday was repulsed. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he expected the Syrians to strike at the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Metn </LOCATION> area, north of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Gharb </LOCATION>. `` They'll try again and again and again,'' said a spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislator said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> planned to warn <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of certain lines it should not cross in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. If <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> passes these points, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military might intervene, said <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc following a report by the defense minister. Officials have said in the past that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not tolerate Syrian troops south of the <LOCATION> Awali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION>, about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border, or into areas from which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew in 1985 in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Disabled Workers Drop in Earnings, Rate of Employment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The handicapped are losing earning power because those who do manage to find jobs often get low-level positions with little chance for advancement, says a disabled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Disabled men earned 64 percent as much as male employees in general in 1987, while disabled women made 62 percent of the amount earned by all female workers, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. That was down from 77 percent for handicapped men and 69 percent for disabled women in 1980, the report said. One major reason, speculated <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, is that handicapped workers are often placed in a limited type of job and simply left there. `` Companies say, well, how can he ever move up. They give him a job in the back room, sorting mail, and they do n't ever look at him again. He is n't reviewed when they advance other employees,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a disabled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who directs the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> office of Disabled American Veterans. Many companies are leery of hiring the disabled, he added, noting that companies may fear having to spend money on special accommodations or that the worker will be out sick a lot. That may be partly why the employment rate among the disabled has also declined in the 1980s, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> speculated. `` It's harder for the really disabled veteran or individual to become employed.'' Other factors in that drop could include concern by the handicapped over losing their <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid benefits, and the lack of strong laws encouraging hiring the disabled, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippolitus </PERSON>, director of plans, projects and services for the President's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Employment of the Handicapped. For disabled men, the share working full-time fell from 29.8 percent in 1981 to 23.4 percent in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported. Disabled women increased slightly, with 11.4 percent working full-time in 1981, growing to 13.1 percent in 1988. Part-time disabled male workers dropped from 41.9 percent to 35.8 percent; part-time female workers rose from 23.5 percent to 27.5 percent. Laws mandating equal employment for the disabled do not cover all employers and have failed to have a major impact, <PERSON> Hippolitus </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. As to the relative income decline, <PERSON> Hippolitus </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> that many companies `` think only in terms of entry-level positions -LRB- for the disabled -RRB- and tend to leave them there.'' `` People with disabilities have the greatest problems with upward mobility and career advancement. They are perceived as fitting into some particular area but not as moving up. As everybody else moves up the career ladder they do n't,'' <PERSON> Hippolitus </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> study, the first to compare the employment of disabled people over time, does not include explanations for the changes in income and employment. It is based on the Current Population Survey, which conducts interviews with about 60,000 households every month. The report classified people as disabled if they reported a health problem that prevented them from working or limited the types of work they could do, but it did not specify particular types of disabilities. The study covered people ages 16 to 64. Average earnings of disabled males rose from $ 12,579 in 1980 to $ 15,497 in 1987, but in the same period earnings of all male workers climbed from $ 16,362 to $ 24,095. For disabled women, earnings rose from $ 5,335 to $ 8,075 while earnings of all women went from $ 7,770 to $ 13,000. The years used to compare employment rates differ slightly from those used to compare income because, while people were asked about their disabilities at the time of the study, they were asked to list their earnings in the prior year. The employment figures for the disabled in 1988 also disclosed that blacks were most likely to be disabled, at 13.7 percent, compared with 8.2 percent of Hispanic Americans and 7.9 percent of whites.

<HEAD>Percentage of Unemployed Collecting Benefits Dropping</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The share of jobless workers who get unemployment insurance has never been lower, mainly due to stricter government regulations and a shift to a service economy, a private research group says. Only 31.5 percent of all unemployed workers _ 2.1 million out of 6.7 million _ received benefits in the average month last year, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said Tuesday. That percentage tied the record low measured in 1987, and was the sixth straight year that the proportion receiving assistance has not improved. Researchers at the Washington-based center conceded that the figure was not as alarming as it appears on its surface, because large numbers of jobless people do not qualify for public assistance. Nonetheless, they said the finding is significant because it shows that the public safety net is shrinking. `` The record low level of unemployment insurance coverage in 1988 not only indicates an economic security problem for today's unemployed, but it also may be a harbinger of what will occur in the event of a new recession,'' the group's report said The center calculated the figures using Department of Labor statistics. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a researcher at the center who helped write the report, attributed the high number of jobless people without insurance to a tendency for workers to be out of work longer than before. Public unemployment programs expire after a fixed period, usually 26 weeks for state aid and 13 additional weeks for federal benefits that last year were available in only one state: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> cited federal and state eligibility restrictions that were tightened during the 1980s. He said another factor was the increase in service jobs at the expense of manufacturing positions, where workers are more likely to be notified by their union or company that they can apply for assistance. `` With a service economy, it's less likely people might know they're eligible,'' he said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyrsch </PERSON>, director of unemployment insurance in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, did not dispute the report's statistics. But she said many of the jobless do n't qualify for unemployment insurance because they did not work long enough, left their jobs voluntarily or were fired for adverse actions. Historically, only about 40 percent of the jobless receive coverage, she said. `` We're concerned about the difference between the 40-odd percent and the 31 percent that is reported'' by the center, she said. Between 1955, the earliest year for which figures are available, and 1984, the percentage of covered workers dropped below 40 percent only once, when it hit 39.3 percent in 1966. The nation's unemployment rate has dropped steadily since 1982, when it reached 9.7 percent. It was 5.5 percent last year. The center said the situation was worst for minorities. Just 21 percent of unemployed blacks and 14 percent of jobless Hispanics received unemployment benefits last year, according to the report. In 28 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, two-parent families with a jobless worker can get other assistance, even if they do not receive unemployment insurance. The proportion of jobless workers receiving benefits last year varied widely among the states, from 17.3 percent in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to 72 percent in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Only in four states did most unemployed workers get insurance: <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> where 57.3 percent were covered; <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with 51.5 percent; and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> with 50.2 percent. By contrast, there were 16 states where less than one-in-four jobless workers was covered: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 Leftist opposition supporters and members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hurled bottles, rocks and sticks at each other as the electoral college met to decide a disputed state election Tuesday. At least 18 people were injured, officials said. Police used tear gas and sprayed water from a fire truck to break up the confrontation. Several hundred people had gathered early in the day outside the Legislative Palace, where the electoral college held its meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said about 30 people were treated for inhalation of the fumes, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michoacan </ORGANIZATION> said. Most were injured after being hit in the head, and four were in serious condition, the paper said. The fire truck, a police car, an ambulance and eight private vehicles were destroyed in the disturbance in the <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state capital, 145 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Army troops guarded the main square Tuesday night. The leftist party has been picketing outside the state government offices since the July 2 legislative election. Official results gave the ruling party, known as <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, 12 of the 18 directly elected seats and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, six. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claims it won 14 seats and says voting in the other four districts should be annulled because of widespread fraud. Six other seats are to be assigned to minority parties according to the percentage of the vote they received. The college was to meet again on Friday to ratify the results and announce its decision.

<HEAD>Farmers Pay More for Fuel</HEAD>

 Farmers are paying more for gasoline, diesel fuel and other forms of energy, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says the total bill is n't much different from the early 1970s if inflation is taken into account. Economist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehring </PERSON> also said that the switch from gasoline to diesel-powered tractors has prompted a sharp reduction in the amount of fuel used per acre. Overall, 1989 farm energy prices are expected to remain above 1988 levels because of higher crude oil costs in recent months, according to a report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Energy spending by farmers are forecast to increase about 6 percent from 1988 to around $ 7.5 billion, reflecting the higher prices and greater fuel use needed to handle an expansion in crop acres, the report said. <PERSON> Nehring </PERSON>, one of the authors of the report, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the $ 7.5 billion forecast for 1989 farm energy expenditures will be the highest since 1985 when spending totaled $ 9 billion. The record farm energy bill, which includes diesel fuel, gasoline and LP gas from liquefied petroleum, was about $ 10.2 billion in 1981 at the peak of the oil crunch. In 1974, by comparison, the farm energy bill was around $ 3 billion. But those are `` nominal'' costs for specific years and do n't take general inflation into account. When that is done, <PERSON> Nehring </PERSON> said, the farm fuel bill overall wo n't be much different from 1974. For example, using 1967 dollars as a base, the government's consumer price index for all items increased from an average of 147.7 percent in 1974 to 340.4 percent by 1987 and has continued to rise <PERSON> Nehring </PERSON> said that the consumption of fuels used by farmers has declined significantly since the mid-1970s. `` Roughly, the consumption of gasoline, diesel fuel and LP per cultivated acre declined from about 24 gallons in the mid-1970s to about 15 gallons currently,'' he said. `` That basically reflects the replacement of gasoline by diesel fuel.'' In its report, the agency said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refiners paid an average of $ 16.50 per barrel in the first quarter of 1989, up about 25 percent from the last quarter of 1988. For all of this year, crude oil prices are expected to be in the range of $ 15 to $ 20 per barrel. <PERSON> Nehring </PERSON> said the peak year was 1981 when crude oil averaged $ 33 per barrel, triple the $ 11 of 1976. Net imports of oil are expected to rise by more than 10 percent this year to a daily average of 7 million barrels, or 41 percent of domestic consumption. The record was 8.6 million barrels a day in 1977, or 47 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption. Imports dropped to 4.3 million barrels daily in 1985, only 27 percent of use. On-farm use of diesel fuel declined about 3 percent last year due to the drought, while gasoline and LP use held steady. But with a return for better weather and larger crop plantings, diesel use by farmers is expected to jump 14 percent this year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has allocated $ 200 million to 46 organizations under the Targeted Export Assistance program for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Under TEA, as the program is called, various trade associations get funds to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products. The program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse effects of unfair foreign trade practices on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their own money in carrying out specific projects. The amount of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that oversees the program. The $ 200 million announced Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is the same as for the current fiscal year, a level set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1989 appropriations legislation. Officials said the 1990 allocations will be finalized after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes work on next year's appropriations bill. The largest amount for next fiscal year was $ 15.4 million reserved for <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to promote raw cotton in overseas markets, followed by $ 12.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

 WANTED: Big, beautiful beast, one of last of dying breed, as possible mate for same. Serious inquiries only. That's the pitch a group of zoologists is making to zookeepers around the country. Their matchmaking service, a sort of modern-day <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s Ark, could be the last hope for many wild animals facing extinction. This ark is fashioned from computer software and cooperation. Through it, a black rhino calf was born in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to a mother swapped from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> whose seven previous offspring had lived less than a month. `` Logistically, it was difficult and expensive,'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON>, registrar at the Detroit Zoological Park. She said the switch cost around $ 6,000, but `` it was well worth it.'' The calf, born in March, was doing well on Tuesday, <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON> said. The black rhino is declining at a rate of 97 percent per generation, said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flesness </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, which compiles data for the animal swapping program. The animal's population has plummeted from 70,000 in 1970 to about 3,000 today, and captivity may be the key to its preservation. `` Humans shoot them to sell their horns for enough to retire on for the rest of their life,'' said <PERSON> Flesness </PERSON>. The program, with headquarters here in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, is called the Species Survival Plan. It was set up by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Aquariums in 1980 with a goal not only of matching animals, but also of convincing zookeepers that donating or swapping some of their most prized possessions is in the long-term interest of their profession. Fifty species _ including the gorilla, cheetah and thick-billed parrot _ so far have climbed aboard the computer ark. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foose </PERSON>, the program's coordinator, says he hopes that number will increase tenfold by the start of the next century. The choice of species to include usually comes down to `` the big and the beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Flesness </PERSON>. `` It's a long way short of everything, but it's a lot better than doing nothing.'' <PERSON> Foose </PERSON>'s group tracks data, including genealogy and medical history, compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> ISIS </ORGANIZATION> on over 96,000 living vertebrate specimens in 347 zoos and 32 countries. <PERSON> Foose </PERSON> says that as a result of the gorilla program, for example, there is less inbreeding and healthier babies are being born. About 15 gorillas have been born a year for the last 10 years with the population presently at about 300. `` We've gone from a situation where that population was declining to one where it's increasing by about 2 or 3 percent a year,'' he said. `` That's very healthy.'' Gorilla mating is difficult since long-established pairs tend to treat each other like brother and sister. The solution, <PERSON> Flesness </PERSON> said, is just a plane ride away: `` Put one of the two partners on airplanes, switch them to another zoo, and let them make friends.'' While conservationists once had misgivings about keeping exotic animals in captivity, they now are realizing the role zoos can play in preservation, said <PERSON> Flesness </PERSON>. Wildlife managers, he said, increasingly realize they have a small population and that it is often in one place. `` They want to take their species into captivity for insurance reasons, and they suddenly move into the same arena, the same set of challenges as zoos.'' The Puerto Rican parrot is an example. Forty-three of the birds exist in the wild on the island, and an equal number live in captivity there. `` If one bad hurricane comes, they'll not only wipe out the wild birds but at least endanger the ones in the aviary,'' said <PERSON> Flesness </PERSON>. Conservationists, he said, have agreed that a few of the animals should be moved to a mainland zoo. The prospects of easing animals back into the wild look bleak, he said, as long as humans keep encroaching on their natural habitat. `` The species that are going to make it out there are the ones that can handle lots of bulldozers, highway disturbance, and little teeny spots of semi-wild land left,'' he said. `` The big ones are the ones that are ... going to go unless we do something radically different. What's surprising is that they're going to go in our lifetime.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to argue its case before the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a suit by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian jetliner, but a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration spokesman declines to say whether the decision will be abided. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> made the announcement Tuesday, shortly after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House news conference that he hoped to end a decade-long estrangement from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could help free American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has offered to pay the families of the 290 passengers and crew members who died July 3, 1988, when the USS Vincennes shot down the Iranian airbus in the mistaken belief it was an attacking F-14 fighter. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to give the compensation to the Iranian government, insisting that it go directly to the relatives. `` We have not gotten an official response yet from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'' on compensation, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` We continue to hope that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will do the right thing for its citizens.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> filed suit May 17 in the World Court, located at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION> and formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, alleging that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violated the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> conventions on civil aviation. The lawsuit demands payment. No date for the trial has been set. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys argue that civil aviation conventions do n't apply to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which was protecting shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> pulled out of the war shortly after the jetliner was shot down. `` In this case, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> acted on the belief that the airliner was a hostile military aircraft,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` The mere fact that this belief was erroneous does not make the act of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> unlawful.'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, asked whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to participate in the case means that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will respect any ruling by the court, said: `` I do n't think you can say it is an irrevocable decision binding us to whatever happens. We have the inherent right of self-defense. We would n't accept limitations on that right.'' The decision to argue the suit, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, `` shows the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desire to work within the court. ... It shows our willingness to support the work of the court in appropriate cases.'' The decision was disclosed against the backdrop of efforts to restore diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and win Iranian help in freeing American hostages. `` We do n't have to be hostile with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the rest of our lives,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided they wanted those hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen, perhaps not with certainty, but a good likelihood.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration dubbed the 15-member panel a `` propaganda forum'' in 1984, when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> took the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to court to seek an injunction against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> walked out halfway through the proceedings, saying the court had no jurisdiction. After 17 months, the court ordered an immediate halt to all American aid to the Contras. The court is reviewing a Nicaraguan demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compensation for damages inflicted by the rebels during their seven-year insurgency. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is n't participating in that procedure. `` We did appear in the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> case in order to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` The court's decision in that case we found to be untenable.'' Since the 1985 walkout, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been involved in two other cases, losing both times. The court ruled last month that Italian authorities had legally confiscated the Sicilian branch of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics company in the late 1960s. In 1988, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration suffered a defeat when the court ruled that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s plan to close down the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> violated international law.

<TEXT>
 Remember all that talk about pork rinds during last year's campaign? Forget it. About the only place you can find them in the White House is in a vending machine in the press area. <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides say the president rarely munches on pork rinds while working in the Oval Office. In fact, his favorite snack appears to be popcorn. And, while jelly beans used to reign supreme in the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, these are days of candy wars in the top corridors of power at the White House. Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> keeps a full bowl of licorice outside his office. It serves as the same social gathering point for staff members as water coolers do in other offices. A rival bowl of confections _ candy-coated chocolate <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ms _ sits outside the <ORGANIZATION> Oval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and has its own flock of devotees. Last week, a minor rebellion erupted after some unidentified _ but health-conscious _ staffer replaced the <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ms outside the president's office with what may have looked like pork rinds at first glance, but that turned out to be oat bran cereal. The oat bran went nearly untouched. The crowd grew bigger at <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s licorice bowl. After a few days of protest, the dietary experiment was halted. The M & amp; Ms are back. Meanwhile, pork rinds, while scarce at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, are regularly put out in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cabin aboard Air Force One. The president and the staff that emulates him by jogging, playing tennis and horseshoes and riding exercise bikes apparently devotes more time to exercise than nutrition. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, meanwhile, is one who has n't been caught up in the recent exercise binge. His idea of exercise, claim staff members, is playing computer games _ particularly mathematical ones. Asked why he had n't been swept up in the fitness craze, the stocky <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told a reporter: `` Hey, listen, I wish I had more time, and I should probably have more discipline. `` I've been playing a little basketball with the kids at home,'' he added. But he made it clear that you wo n't see him jogging alongside the president during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three-week vacation in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, which begins today. `` I think it's great'' that the president can engage in such activities, said his chief of staff. `` I think it adds to his capacity.''

 Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a recent lunch guest at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was asked by reporters about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state of mind in the midst of the recent hostage crisis. `` I think remarkably calm, peaceful,'' Law said, speaking on the driveway outside the White House. `` I think the president is a very competent person. And he listens, he's interested. He has the ability to ask pretty probing questions. And I experienced all that during the course of the meal.'' The cardinal went on to say he counts himself among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s friends `` It's a very good, close, warm relationship. I feel as though, if I have something that I wanted to discuss with the president that I could easily contact him.'' He paused a moment, then added: `` I would hope that I would never abuse that because, God knows, I read someplace that he's got 10,000 very close personal friends. `` When you're one among 10,000 ... you do n't want to overdo that.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he would n't hesitate to use military force if he thought that would safely rescue the eight Americans being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. However, the president said he did n't `` want to be responsible for the loss of innocent life.'' `` But if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and bring them out, and that required using the military force of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, make no mistake about it _ I would do it in an instant,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday at his 21st formal news conference since taking office seven months ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed the uncertainties that involve any military response when asked why he had not retaliated for the murder of hostage Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who embarks today on a 20-day vacation to his oceanfront retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, again signaled that he is willing to work to improve the bitter U.S.-Iranian relations of the last decade. `` We do n't have to be hostile with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the rest of our lives,'' the president said. `` We've had a good relationship with them in the past.'' The first step, he said, is for the Islamic republic to stop supporting terrorism and to pressure the Lebanese kidnappers to release their American captives. `` I think that if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided they wanted those hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would happen.'' Noting conflicting signals from the new Iranian leadership about rapprochement with the West, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` the jury is still out as to what has happened internally ... in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' He said he ca n't say the chances of a breakthrough on the hostages are closer today than three weeks ago, `` but we're going to keep on trying.'' On another matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> previewed the national anti-drug strategy he and drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will send to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 5. The drug strategy `` will target all aspects of the problem,'' including new efforts to cut off drugs at the source as well as tougher penalties for casual users, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think the day of tolerance for those who break the law in using drugs is over,'' he said. `` We are going to expand federal expenditures'' for the drug fight not by raising taxes but through `` some reallocation of resources.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave no specifics, but said his budget office was drawing up a list of programs from which funds could be diverted. On other topics, the president: _ Refused to rule out the possibility of abducting Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to face drug-trafficking charges `` I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he said. _ Declared he was `` very comfortable'' with budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s complaint that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was keeping interest rates too high _ Praised Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss., killed in separate plane crashes, as `` outstanding public servants'' who gave their lives trying `` to better the lot of mankind _ Said that if <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric seized last month by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos, were indicted for the kidnapping of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, `` I would be remiss if I did n't try to see him brought to trial. _ Suggested `` some kind of international effort'' to offer military assistance to countries that request help in eradicating drug production _ Expressed the hope that `` the legal process -LRB- can -RRB- go on without a lot of hype'' against suspended <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> diplomat <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, suspected of spying

 Federal engineers say they are stepping up their investigation into complaints that as many as 1.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> cars manufactured between 1982 and 1984 have a dangerous seating defect. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that it had received 96 complaints that the cars' seat backs shifted backward suddenly and without warning. The agency considers the allegations serious enough to upgrade a preliminary evaluation into an engineering analysis, said spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. The change means engineers will study actual seat backs to determine whether they are defective, as opposed to paperwork analysis. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Spetner </PERSON> said the company was reviewing the decision and would have no immediate comment. The Nissan action was among several announced Tuesday, including new or upgraded investigations of models sold under the nameplates of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, Mercury, <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>, Oldsmobile and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> and the closing of other investigations involving <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, Chevrolet and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've had large recalls of other cars for seat-back failures,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> action. `` It's a hazard. You can lose control of your car if the seat back suddenly fails.'' Complaints to <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> have blamed 22 accidents and 13 injuries on the alleged defect, he said. The agency's engineers are examining these <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> models manufactured during the 1982, 1983 and 1984 model years: Maxima, <PERSON> Pulsar </PERSON>, Sentra, Stanza, 200SX, 300ZX, 510 and 720. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also launched an investigation of 1987 and 1988 Ford Escorts and Mercury Lynxes after 13 complaints that safety belts had failed. Four injuries have been blamed on the belts' alleged failure to restrain occupants during accidents, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. Also, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> granted a petition requesting an engineering analysis of the 1989 Peugeot Model 405. Six complaints have been filed about malfunctions of the passive restraint system in 2,200 cars, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The agency also reported opening preliminary investigations of: _ Stabilizer bar breakage in 400,000 Toyota Tercels from model years 1982 through 1988 _ Passive restraint system problems in the 1987 Hyundai Excel _ Rear-belt failure in the 1989 Ford Festiva _ Brake dragging and locking in 30,000 BMW models _ the 325, 524TD, 528E and 5351 from the 1985 through 1987 model years _ Parking cable wearing in several 1985-1987 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> cars: the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION>, the Pontiac Grand Prix, the Oldsmobile Cutlass and the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regal </ORGANIZATION> _ Front wheel drive steering column locking in 500,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars with tilt steering wheels sold under <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> and Dodge nameplates The agency also raised several preliminary evaluations to the engineering analysis level. One was a probe of 1,064 <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabres </ORGANIZATION>, Oldsmobile 98s and <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonnevilles </ORGANIZATION> from 1986 and 1987 in the wake of complaints about jammed brakes. Another involved safety belt failures in 6,282 Toyota Land Cruisers. The agency reported discontinuing a probe into seat-back failures in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> passenger cars made between 1983 and 1986, finding insufficient grounds to proceed. The agency closed three other investigations, finding there was `` no defect trend.'' The investigations were into complaints of: _ Heater core failure in the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION> GL _ Fuel filler pipe spurting in the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> Car _ Brake lamp switch problems in the 1989 Chevrolet Celebrity

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, unsuccessful in a bid for federal approval to tear down the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant, still insists the new plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> will not open. `` No matter what their intent is, they're not going to be able to open this plant,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Tuesday after a nearly one-hour meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the plan to tear down a completed nuclear power plant before it produces any commercial electricity was `` an upside-down energy policy that defies any kind of logical description.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, wants the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant `` mothballed'' so it can possibly be resurrected later. `` I do n't think anything was done to change the governor's mind. I do n't think anything was done to change the president's mind,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after the meeting. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said `` the most productive part of the meeting is that the -LRB- energy -RRB- planners would get together'' sometime later to discuss energy policy. The governor also said he will continue to pursue court challenges to the federal government's authority to intervene in the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> case. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declined to characterize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to his presentation, but said it was a positive sign that the president agreed to the meeting. At issue is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s plan to dismantle the $ 5.5 billion Shoreham plant as part of its agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which would sell the plant to the state for $ 1. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> gets guaranteed rate increases of about 5 percent for a decade. Although the deal has been approved by the state and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> stockholders, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has said it will try to prevent the deal by opposing transfer of <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>'s license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must approve the transfer and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has tried to slow that process by asking the commission to order its own environmental review of the impact of closing <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and using alternative energy sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also wants the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to stop <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> from further reducing staff at the plant. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> joined a lawsuit that challenges the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> shutdown on environmental grounds. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> requested the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the plant should be mothballed _ put in storage, in effect _ for a few years until <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents realized they needed the power the plant would provide. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> met Tuesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and deputy chief of staff <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, on a flight back to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, told reporters that `` <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is an old politician who does n't write sentences, he writes slogans. ... They talk in slogans, they really do. And when they talk in sentences, they get in trouble.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was referring to <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> could be operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the state agency buying the plant under the agreement. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said state law prohibits the agency from operating a nuclear power plant. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> argues that <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> would be unsafe to operate because <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could n't be evacuated in case of an accident. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has approved an evacuation plan for <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> simply was personally opposed to opening the plant.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is overhauling its minority set-aside program in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> bribery and influence-peddling scandal. The regulations, issued Tuesday and effective immediately, put into effect legislation signed nine months ago by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They are designed to minimize political influence on the agency's 21-year-old program under which companies owned by blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Indians and economically disadvantaged women are given preference in the awarding of government contracts Among the changes: _ The director of the program will be a career employee of the agency, rather than a political appointee <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> named <PERSON> Erline </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, a former staff aide to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to the post. `` The person in charge will not have to respond as much to the political pressures,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. _ Companies that misrepresent their status as minority-owned will be subject to stiffer penalties The maximum fine was increased from $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 and the top jail term from five years to 10 years. _ For the first time, competitive bidding is required among minority-owned companies for manufacturing contracts over $ 5 million and product and service contracts over $ 3 million _ The length of time a company may get special preference was lengthened from seven years to nine years, but companies will be expected to derive a steadily decreasing percentage of their revenues from contracts awarded under the program _ Owners of eligible companies must have net worth of less than $ 250,000, excluding equity in their home or business, when they enter the program The old standard was $ 750,000, including home or business equity. _ The agency must rule on applications within 90 days <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, at a news conference, said about 3,000 companies participate. She said the net worth requirement and the initiation of competitive bidding may discourage new participants, but she said she hoped the deadline for decisions would boost participation.

<HEAD>Algae Substances Show Anti-AIDS Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government experiments show that four fatty substances found in common ocean algae are `` strikingly active'' against the AIDS virus, scientists say. Algae extracts protected cells of the human immune system against attack by the human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS, a team of scientists for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported. The substances, called sulfolipids, are structural components of membranes of chlorophyll-containing cell components in many plants, algae and micro-organisms. Their viral-fighting ability had not been known before and was discovered in the cancer institute's program to screen substances for potential AIDS-fighting ability. `` The pure compounds were strikingly active,'' with all four showing similar activity, according to the report in Tuesday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> However, the effectiveness varied according to which line of test cells was being used. Compounds with similar chemical structures gave no protection against the virus. The test could not show how the sulfolipids protected against viral activity, the report said. `` The sulfolipids that we have identified represent an intriguing new structural class of potential AIDS-antiviral compounds,'' the scientists wrote. `` Because of the urgency for identification and comparative clinical evaluation'' of new anti-AIDS drugs, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Decision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has selected the sulfolipid class as a high priority for further pre-clinical investigation and for evaluation of feasibility as a candidate for clinical testing,'' wrote the team. So far, only one drug, zidovudine or AZT, has been shown to be effective against AIDS, though some others can help fight diseases that result from AIDS.

<HEAD>Military Police Flood Newspapers with `Dirty Laundry'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspapers are being flooded with anonymous letters from an unusual source _ disgruntled gendarmes, the military corpsmen who make up almost half of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 200,000 police officers. Government officials have replied by saying reforms will be proposed this fall, and in the meantime the gendarmes should think about the soldier's duty not to air the military's dirty laundry in public. National and regional newspapers have received dozens of letters, each purporting to speak for a large number of gendarmes who are unhappy about pay scales, long hours and poor living conditions in barracks. The 90,000 gendarmes are responsible for police duties on most French highways and in rural areas, although they also sometimes patrol in cities. Special squads fight terrorism, monitor river traffic and patrol airports, among other tasks. The line between the duties of the gendarmerie and the national police is not always clear, and leads to frequent conflict between the two bodies. It occasionally leads to arrests of gendarmes by police or vice-versa. The gendarmerie traces its origins back centuries to the `` Marechaussee,'' medieval soldiers called to catch bandits and highwaymen. It got its name and current status in 1791, at the height of the French Revolution. `` It's a unique organization that exists in no other country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> once said, according to a history of the gendarmes. `` It's the most efficient way to maintain the tranquility of a country. ... It's a half-civil, half-military surveillance, spread over the entire territory.'' Gendarmes answer to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. They are trained, paid and expected to work and live like soldiers, while doing exactly the same tasks as police. Unlike police, they can not form unions, and are not paid overtime. Speaking out publicly means certain disciplinary action under military rules. An anonymous letter published in the regional daily <ORGANIZATION> Ouest-France </ORGANIZATION> complained about `` the 120 hours on-call each week, including 60 to 80 hours working, no overtime pay or compensatory time off and no compensation for working weekends and holidays.'' Starting pay is $ 1,135 monthly for the unmarried, and pay increases on a sliding scale for those with families. Several letters said that, once unpaid overtime is taken into account, gendarmes barely get the minimum wage. A letter published by the national daily France-Soir from an anonymous gendarme's wife who signed herself `` Madame X'' denounced `` the degradation of family life.'' She said the gendarmerie makes life `` abominable for couples, leading many of them to divorce.'' Married gendarmes live in apartments built into the barracks, with widely varying amenities. The first anonymous letters appeared in regional newspapers in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in early August and only gradually attracted national attention. Soon there was a flood, with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> counting almost 20 over the weekend of Aug. 12-13. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Renon </PERSON>, the junior minister in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said in a television interview that the letters dealt with `` problems we know about and are working on.'' Other government officials said a proposal would be presented in the fall to redistribute the work force, upgrade the barracks, assure at least some free time to the gendarmes and possibly increase the number of draftees allowed to do their military service as auxiliary gendarmes. The director-general of the gendarmerie, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mourier </PERSON>, issued a statement saying he was aware of the problems and was working on them. Meanwhile, he said, the gendarmes should keep quiet, `` not just from respect for the obligations of the military status, but from respect for the institution, its history and its place in the nation,'' <PERSON> Mourier </PERSON> said. The call to silence just unleashed more letters. `` It's not by telling us to shut up that the problems will be solved,'' said an anonymous letter published in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limoges </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` Watch out, general officers and elected officials, disgust and discontent is getting established in this good old Marechaussee.''

 The American Museum of Natural History has decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to dinosaurs. The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an apatosaurus _ commonly known as a brontosaurus _ looked like. But because the museum's 17-foot-tall, 66-foot-long apatosaurus skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140 million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant. So the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads. One is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton, another is a model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the apatosaurus' real head, and the third is the head of a close relative of the extinct beast. `` We may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton with a skull attached, but we think this is the most likely guess based on the available evidence until we actually find a complete skeleton with a skull attached,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingus </PERSON>, exhibit coordinator. No one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull attached. The skull created for the 1905 model skeleton was based on that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin, a camarasaurus. Since then, paleontologists have changed their minds about the apatosaurus' likely relatives. A paper published in 1978 argued that the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus, implying the apatosaurus had a longer, sleeker head than had been believed. When the museum tried to behead its apatosaurus in preparation for a new skull, `` it sent vibrations down the skeleton and a couple of the ribs fell off and broke,'' <PERSON> Dingus </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The second explosion of a submarine-launched Trident 2 missile in five months could again delay <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to send its newest, deadliest weapon on operational patrol. The original December target was put off until March 1990 by the first failure. Now the March goal is in jeopardy. One of the 44-foot, $ 23.7 million missiles exploded Tuesday seconds after it was launched from the nuclear submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> while it cruised submerged about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the blowup caused no injuries nor did it damage the submarine or a nearby support ship. Officials said the problem occurred shortly after the missile cleared the surface and ignited, reminiscent of the first Trident 2 submarine launch on March 21. That missile blew apart four seconds after it was launched by the crew of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Investigators traced the problem in March to a mechanical linkage responsible for moving the rocket steering nozzles back and forth. The faulty part was redesigned. On Aug. 2, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> launched a Trident 2 with the design changes on the missile's first underwater success, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hopes were buoyed. There was no immediate indication whether the two failures were related, and officials said they wo n't know exactly what went wrong Tuesday until they study radio telemetry tapes of the missile's behavior There was no immediate assessment of what impact the latest failure will have on the Trident 2 operational schedule. The first failure set back the plan three months. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had planned about six more underwater tests before sending the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on operational patrol in March with 24 of the nuclear-tipped weapons. Nine Trident 2 submarines are planned. Each missile is capable of propelling as many as 10 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away. Nineteen Trident 2s were test-fired from a land launch pad before sea trials began. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rated 15 of them successful.

 A proposal to allow riverboat gambling passed in two <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> counties, but a third county surprised some people by sinking the floating casinos plan by a wide margin. Voters in <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the largest of the three counties, approved the proposal by a 2-1 margin. With about 25 percent of voters going to the polls, 7,793 or 66 percent voted yes and 3,913 or 33 percent disapproved. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> vote was expected, but <LOCATION> Allamakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s rejection did n't seem to be in the cards, some said, because there was little organized opposition `` It was very quiet.

Six more <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> counties along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> will hold special elections this month on the plan. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s new riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion boats, beginning April 1, 1991, in counties where voters first approve it by a majority vote in a referendum. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> limited betting to $ 5 per play and set a $ 200 limit on losses. Boats can offer blackjack, roulette, slot machines, dice games and video gambling. The state <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will decide how many licenses to grant and where the boats will dock, but that decision is n't expected until next year. <PERSON> Harrmann </PERSON> said the City Council will select a possible site for a dock if <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> acquires a license. He said supporters have contacted three or four excursion boat operators to possibly operate a floating casino. One of them is Fried-Schegan and Associates of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Company President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> said: `` We're confident that <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> made the right decision and applaud their efforts. Passage of this referendum means that this region is one step closer to bringing a first-class national tourist attraction to the Midwest.'' Special elections are scheduled Aug. 22 for voters in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> counties. An Aug. 29 referendum is set for voters in <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION> counties. In western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, petitions are being circulated in <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> counties. No dates have been set for referendums there, the secretary of state's office said.

<HEAD>Town Agonizes Over Fate of Soldier Missing in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROSH HAAYIN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Lebanese hostage crisis has increased anxieties in this community, where residents pray for one of their own _ a soldier who according to news accounts may have died more than three years ago. <PERSON> Rachamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheikh </PERSON>, 23, was captured on Feb. 17, 1986, when Shiite Moslem extremists ambushed an Israeli convoy. Since then, there has been no word from <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, also 23, who was taken in the same attack. Recent reports have said they died of wounds shortly after their capture by the radical militia <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. A neighbor said the Alsheikhs suffer `` in total silence, seldom making their anguish public.'' The family declined to be interviewed. `` The <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> family's pain is felt by the entire community,'' said the neighbor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They are never alone, there is always someone from the family or the neighborhood with them.'' <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Haayin </PERSON> is a small town on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Like the <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> family, most of its residents are Jewish immigrants from <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. The community never forgot <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION>'s capture, but anxiety over it was heightened on July 28 when Israeli commandos abducted a Shiite Moslem cleric reputed to be a leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in a raid in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to swap the cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, and hundreds of Shiite prisoners for an Israeli navigator shot down over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1986, <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and the 16 Western hostages. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, abducted 4 -LCB- years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said in an report last weekend, however, that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s interrogators concluded the two infantrymen died of wounds shortly after the ambush. The newspaper quoted unidentified senior sources in the Israeli government. Israeli officials, in an effort to reassure the families of the missing men, said they assume the soldiers are alive unless there is conclusive proof to the contrary. At a public prayer session Monday in <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Haayin </PERSON>'s synagogue, <PERSON> Rachamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheikh </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON>, tearfully recited Psalms and prayers for his son and other missing Israeli soldiers. Hundreds of the town's 13,000 residents attended the service. `` Praying may be the only way to save our sons,'' the elder <PERSON> Alshiekh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rachamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheikh </PERSON> was captured while serving in the elite <ORGANIZATION> Givati </ORGANIZATION> infantry brigade. Under a special arrangement for students who attended Jewish seminaries, he divided his mandatory military service between religious studies and combat duty. <PERSON> Yehiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahavi </PERSON>, 53, a factory worker who has lived across the street from the <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> house since 1950, described <PERSON> Rachamim </PERSON> as a `` devout young man.'' <PERSON> Zahavi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rachamim </PERSON> attended a private Orthodox grade school and then a seminary in a nearby town. There are six other <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> children, one of whom has devoted his life to religious studies, <PERSON> Zahavi </PERSON> said. The owner of a neighborhood restaurant described <PERSON> Rachamim </PERSON> as `` innocent about the world.'' All men and women in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has a population of 4.2 million, are drafted into the military. The abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was portrayed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders as an example of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` sacred principle'' that every effort be made to gain freedom for captured soldiers. <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Haayin </PERSON> residents remain optimistic in the face of the conflicting reports about <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION>'s fate. `` I served in the army and in all the wars,'' <PERSON> Zahavi </PERSON> said. `` I know that the army always takes care of its boys, never abandons them.''

<HEAD>Agency Gets Criticism For Tranquilizing Pole-Sitting Bear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state agency said it was only concerned about the safety of residents when it tranquilized a bear that had ambled up a utility pole, causing her to tumble to the ground in a shower of sparks. The state Department of Game and Fish was criticized Tuesday for tranquilizing the bear atop the 25-foot pole without first cutting electrical power or providing a safety net. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkhauser </PERSON>, a conservation officer with the department, said he received nearly 30 calls Tuesday after television and a local newspaper showed the bear falling from the pole, contacting transformer coils that generated the spray of sparks, then trailing smoke 25 feet to the ground. The singed bear survived with a limp after the 7,200-volt shock and the fall, officials said, but that did n't deter callers. `` We've received quite a bit of calls _ primarily criticism. Public opinion in general seems to think it was n't handled as well as it could have been,'' <PERSON> Birkhauser </PERSON> said. `` Most of them would have liked to have seen us put a net under the pole or let the bear come back down off the pole on its own.'' But <PERSON> Birkhauser </PERSON> said public safety was the main concern. `` To have put a net would have been difficult and not terribly smart,'' he said. `` That bear could have came back to and latched on to the person holding the net.'' `` The main concerns of callers were that the bear was tranquilized while too high on the utility pole and no attempt was made to cushion its fall, and that electrical power was n't shut off before the animal was shot down,'' said <PERSON> Merrilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Segrest </PERSON>, deputy supervisor at the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. Department officers shot the bear once on Monday with a tranquilizer dart on a Northeast Heights rooftop, then again after it reached the top of the utility pole. The bear, believed to be from the <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, was taken to the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoological </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where she is doing well, officials said. She sustained an electrical burn on her right hind leg. The bear was believed to have been searching for her lost cub. A 6-month-old cub was captured Sunday in a mulberry tree in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. The cub, which was being held in the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> zoo, is fine, <PERSON> Birkhauser </PERSON> said. `` It's just scared and looking for mama,'' he said.

<HEAD>PEN Writers Conference Will Not Focus on Rushdie Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international writers' group that plans to meet next month in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has decided against focusing on the case of British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, according to an official. <PERSON> Graeme </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, president of the Canadian Center of the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said that although the conference is titled `` The Writer: Freedom and <PERSON> Power </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s predicament will not receive a great deal of attention. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of `` The Satanic Verses,'' has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since Feb. 14, when the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called on Moslems to track down the author and kill him. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual and political leader until his death in June, said the novel blasphemed Islam. The <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an international group of poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists, will hold its annual conference in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> from Sept. 23 to Oct. 1. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said the British-based Committee for the Defense of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> asked that the conference not take up <PERSON> Rushie </PERSON>'s situation. `` It's very hard to know what to do about it,'' he said. `` It's certainly part of the territory for PEN, but there is nothing specific planned at this point `` There are others in far worse conditions than Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, and in saying this, I'm not minimizing his condition,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. Numerous nations that are predominantly Moslem banned <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel after critics said it associated the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> with prostitutes and suggested that the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, was the work of Mohammed rather than <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> Some Western nations pulled the novel from store shelves and dropped plans to publish it. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, a Swedish publisher said it will distribute `` The Satanic Verses'' starting Friday, and will release another book explaining Islamic principles in two weeks. <PERSON> Carl-Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnier </PERSON>, vice chairman of the publishing house <PERSON> Bonnier </PERSON>, said the second book is titled `` Islam, Our Belief,'' written by two Moslem organizations and sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` It is not a polemic book. It describes Islam in a friendly way,'' <PERSON> Bonnier </PERSON> said Tuesday, adding that it explains criticisms of `` The Satanic Verses.'' `` There was never a question of blackmail of any sort,'' he said. Moslems in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> `` want to feel they are getting an opportunity to make their voices heard.'' But he also acknowledged the Moslem groups had made it clear that publishing the book could prevent the kind of violence and protests that occurred in other countries over its publication.

<HEAD>11 Arrested on Charges They Set Jungle on Fire in the Yucatan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eleven people have been arrested on charges they set fires that scorched 370,000 acres of jungle in southeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the Attorney General's office said. The group started fires in the state of <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Roo </PERSON> `` for the purpose of exploiting lumber resources and creating areas for cultivation and uncontrolled human settlements,'' the office said in a communique Tuesday. Residents near one of the fires told authorities they saw two of the suspects pour gasoline across a wide area of jungle, then set it ablaze, the communique said. The fires advanced slowly through the jungle for five months until rain extinguished them in early August. Dry wood and other forest litter from Hurricane Gilbert last September and the late start of the rainy season helped spread the fires, authorities have said. Mexican and foreign experts estimate recovery of the jungle will take more than 30 years, a spokesman for the Group of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectuals </ORGANIZATION>, an ecological organization, said Tuesday. Eight of the 11 were arrested in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, two in <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Roo </PERSON> and one in the state of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>. With 30 others, they had taken over land in <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION> state, also in the southeast, and set fire to it to open land for cultivation, the Attorney General's office said. Unable to control the blaze, they fled to <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Roo </PERSON> in late March. They were charged with property damage, carrying weapons without a license, criminal asociation and violation of forestry and ecological protection laws. The communique said some of those arrested Monday have been involved in fires and illegal land dealings on <LOCATION> Ajusco </LOCATION>, a mountain at the southern edge of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Two of the group were also wanted for various homicides in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the communique said.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> laughed all the way to the ratings bank as their comedy shows took over the top spots in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> survey. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' led the pack, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> claimed the most places with six while <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> failed to place a single program in the Top 10 for the week ended Aug. 13. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' in a tight race all summer with `` Roseanne'' for first, was second.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has begun a crackdown on a lucrative trade in smuggling Persian rugs to evade strict controls on carpet exports. Last month, authorities in southern <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION> province seized more than 750 silk rugs in what the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said was the biggest carpet haul so far. The agency said the rugs were worth millions of dollars. The rugs were hidden inside tanker trucks and would have been illegally shipped from a port on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coast, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> merchants say most smuggled Persian rugs are shipped across the gulf to the coast of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and trucked to warehouses in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, the region's major trading center. The crackdown on carpet smuggling from <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION> province started in July following similar campaigns against narcotics and arms smugglers. It followed reports in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run media that contraband carpet exports would soon outstrip legal sales abroad. According to official statistics, rug exports earned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at least $ 260 million last year, or more than one-third of its non-oil exports. Iranian newspapers estimated another $ 200 million worth were smuggled abroad. Silk rugs, which cost five times as much as wool ones, account for about 15 percent of carpets legally sold abroad. <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> merchants say a trickle of legal exports provides the cover for a huge smuggling network with dealers flying in from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to pick up bargains in Persian carpets. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s carpet industry used to employ more than 2 million people who spent the winter months weaving carpets in their villages. But production fell sharply following the 1979 Islamic revolution and the ouster of the monarchy. Political turmoil shut down major exporting firms and villagers from recession-hit weaving districts flocked to the cities to seek jobs. Soaring inflation meant that imports of fine wools and dyes needed for high-quality carpets were sharply reduced. It takes several years to weave a large carpet in a complex multi-colored design. In the revolution's early days, carpet exports were banned on the grounds they were part of the nation's store of wealth. Now, customs officers value carpets before they can be shipped abroad and exporters have to hand over their foreign currency earnings to the government in exchange for Iranian rials at an artificially low rate. During the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, dealers in the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> stocked up on rugs sold by Iranian tourists given government-paid trips to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> because their relatives had died as `` martyrs'' fighting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally during the eight-year conflict `` The Iranians would bring a small silk rug or two to sell in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. But after the cease-fire last year, there are n't nearly so many Iranians visiting,'' said <PERSON> Nazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahawndi </PERSON>, a dealer in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' cavernous Hamadiye bazaar Despite competition from lower-priced rugs made in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, traditional Persian rugs are still appreciated, Western European dealers say. `` Comparatively speaking, Persian carpets are selling for the equivalent of 1960s prices ... and they do n't wear out, unlike the new <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> rugs,'' <PERSON> Firouz </PERSON> <PERSON> Selmi </PERSON>, an Iranian merchant in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. Antique rugs, some almost 100 years old, are an investment `` that rates with anything else on the international art market,'' he added. A modern rug measuring 6 feet by 6 feet from a leading maker in the southern Iranian city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, a renowned carpet center, can sell for upwards of $ 15,000 at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction house. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, rug merchants mostly buy from private homes as Syrian families sell off the family heirlooms and switch to fitted carpets. Prices are considerably lower. A good-quality Shiraz rug measuring 10 feet by 6 feet costs less than $ 1,500. A top-quality throw rug in varied colors from <LOCATION> Kashan </LOCATION> or in deep red with bold dark designs from <LOCATION> Bokhara </LOCATION> costs about $ 2,000. `` Prices are still reasonable because we get enough stock from the old houses. But it's a limited supply and it ca n't last that much longer,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamedan </PERSON>, whose family runs an antique store in the heart of the maze-like <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> bazaar.

 Soldiers stormed a prison and killed convicts holding a religious group hostage after learning they had murdered male captives and raped the women, the officer in charge of the jail said today. All 16 convicts and five of the 15 hostages died before troops recaptured the jail Tuesday in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 610 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The dead included a 9-year-old boy and Australian missionary <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. One of the captives who was freed said Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> was raped at knifepoint the night before she was killed. Officials said most of the hostages were slain by their captors before the assault and that none of the captives died in the military attack. But in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> may have been killed by soldiers when the convicts tried to break out of the jail hours before troops stormed it. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesman said there was no evidence the military bungled the hostage crisis but announced an investigation into the bloody incident. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Calida </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s police commander and jail superintendent, said civilian officials tried to negotiate with the inmates after they seized the hostages Sunday during religious services at the prison. A few hours before the attack, the convicts had tried to escape by using hostages as shields. During an exchange of gunfire, one captive and one inmate were killed but five hostages escaped. They told police of the rapes and killings, <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station DZXL. `` When we learned that the women were raped and that male hostages were being killed, the task was given to us,'' <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> said. `` So the negotiating team was left with no other choice, because the hostages were being killed one by one. That is what the hostages were telling the negotiating team.'' The attack began at about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firing automatic weapons and secured the downtown jail after about 40 minutes, witnesses and officials said. Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>'s body was found dumped outside the detention center with a bullet wound in the chest. She had only been in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a month. The Rev. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, one of the freed hostages, said Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> and some of the nine other women hostages were raped. Other freed hostages said they heard the women screaming on Monday night. `` <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> told me about the incident,'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said it appeared Miss <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> may have been shot by a soldier during the escape attempt. `` In the doctor's opinion, death was instantaneous and had occurred some hours previously, which would indicate she had been shot during the attempted escape incident in the morning.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said in a report to the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Ms. <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> was seen to slump as the group retreated back through a gateway to the inner compound.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he had asked Philippine officials to investigate her death. In <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, criticized both Australian and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> authorities for their handling of the crisis. `` Why the hell did they have to storm the prison?'' he told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hobart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION>. `` She gave her life to helping other people and now she has paid for it with her life.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> told reporters, `` There appears to be no indication of mishandling the situation although we are examining exactly whether what they reported actually is what really happened, whether or not the casualties could have been avoided and what can be done to avoid similar situations in the future.'' All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group. <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> said the group had been holding prison services for two years as part of a program `` to rehabilitate the prisoners'' to `` help them morally.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the bitter fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and called for an immediate truce and renewed mediation efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The council's 15 member nations unanimously passed the statement Tuesday night after Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> invoked a rarely used power to convene a session when the council failed to act on its own. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> ministers who have tried to mediate a peace settlement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> also called for an immediate truce and denounced the intensified fighting. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, to get the council to act as soon as possible, pushed for the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a statement rather than a stronger, binding resolution, said diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. But minutes before midnight the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a statement, read by Algerian Ambassador <PERSON> Hocine </PERSON> <PERSON> Djoudi </PERSON>, this month's council president It said the council `` profoundly deplores the intensification of the shelling and bitter fighting in recent days.'' `` It expresses its great disquiet at the loss of human lives and the untold suffering it causes to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people,'' the statement said. The council `` urgently appeals to all the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and all shelling on land and at sea. It further appeals to all parties to observe a total and immediate cease-fire.'' When no council member was willing to call for a meeting on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> invoked Article 99 of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter for the first time since he became secretary-general in 1982. The article allows the secretary-general to call emergency meetings on any threat to `` international peace and security.'' The secretary-general only had to resort to this twice before in the 44-year history of the world body, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials. In 1960, Secretary-General <PERSON> Dag </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammarskjold </PERSON> invoked Article 99 to call a meeting on the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> Crisis; in 1979, Secretary-General <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> used it to convene a meeting after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took American hostages at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Some diplomats said the fact that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had to invoke Article 99 showed the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had little hope for the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Christian troops are battling Syrian forces and their Lebanese Moslem allies. The council's statement said it supports an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee that has tried to arrange a cease-fire and political settlement that would end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The members of the league's <ORGANIZATION> Tripartite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Aziz </PERSON> al Saud of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>; and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Late Tuesday night they they issued a statement that said they were `` saddened and profoundly moved by the recent evolution in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, marked by a significant deterioration in security, without precedent,'' the Moroccan news agency MAP reported in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>. The leaders did not single out any party for blame. In a statement Aug. 1, however, the foreign ministers of their nations specifically condemned Syrian's actions and said their peace efforts had come to `` a dead end in both the political and security fields.'' That was the second Arab mediation effort to collapse this year, and the diplomats said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> were not eager to join in a declaration would make them responsible for a solution to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s problems. The council may try to pass a resolution later in the week if the warring parties do not respond to the statement and to other diplomatic initiatives, the diplomats said. The permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary under President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> whose career was tarnished in recent years when he was convicted of income tax evasion and disbarred, has died at age 79. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> died Monday at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, which he entered July 25 suffering from cancer of the esophagus, his son, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said Tuesday. He died from surgery complications. As <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary from 1957 to 1961, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was known as a conservative who put a higher priority on preserving the dollar's value than cutting taxes or paying for additional outlays It was on his recommendation that <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> decided that the projected surplus for fiscal 1961 be used to pay off some of the national debt rather than cutting taxes. After leaving government, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was a limited partner in the New York-based investment banking firm of <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhoades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from 1961 until 1973.

In 1987, he was sentenced to a month in prison and five months' house arrest. He served his prison term in August 1987 and completed his house arrest in January 1988, authorities said. Judge <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> also sentenced him to five years' probation and directed him to make restitution to victims of the bank operation who lost money on his advice The judge said he was aware <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had been hospitalized for alcoholism 10 times since 1981 and ordered him to enter a treatment program. In January, the Appellate Division of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> disbarred <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, saying the illegal banking had been unconscionable. Originally a Democrat, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in his first presidential campaign in 1952 and switched to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in 1956. He served as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1953-54, during which time he carried out <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s request to desegregate <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> posts in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 From the same <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> playground, at about the same time of day, on the same day of the week, two toddlers who lived in the same apartment building vanished. Investigators now are distributing posters around the country of 2-year-old <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dansby </PERSON> and 19-month-old <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> disappeared 5 p.m. Thursday, while <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> was last seen 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 18. The two never played together, but authorities say the disappearances may be linked because of the eerie similarities. Just before they vanished, the toddlers were even playing with the same children. The two playmates, a 10-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother, can not recall seeing anyone take the boys from the busy playground, police said. Authorities have questioned them extensively. `` No one that we have found yet has seen anybody with the child, taking the child by the hand, carrying it, leading it, taking it through a fence, or leaving the playground,'' said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> detectives. He said two black men `` similar only in their dreadlock hair styles'' are being sought for questioning. He declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, who both lived in the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Towers housing project, vanished from the development's large playground. <PERSON> Rosalee </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>'s mother, said she and <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> went to the playground about 5 p.m.. She sat on a bench as <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> played with the two children, she said The kidnapping `` happened so fast,'' she said. `` I turned my head away when this guy asked me a question.'' When she looked back, <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> was gone. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>'s grandmother, believes the two cases are connected. `` In both cases, the kids were taken right under our very noses,'' she said. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said she, too, turned her head away for a minute at the playground, `` and my grandchild was gone.'' The national search includes rewards for the return of the children totaling about $ 30,000. Police have searched the area's sewers, roofs, basements, and air shafts of occupied and abandoned buildings, but have found no signs of the boys. The disappearances also have led investigators back to their files: They've reopened the cases of two other infants kidnapped in the area in the last two years. One theory they have is that <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> were taken as part of a conspiracy to steal or sell babies. But the heads of two private adoption agencies in the city, which place large numbers of black children with adoptive parents, discounted that thought. `` It's hard to imagine,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Louise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a black market for white babies, but for black babies, I do n't think so.'' <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsino </PERSON>, director of the adoption department at Spence-Chapin, said: `` I have not heard of kidnapping any children of that age to satisfy the wishes of adoptive couples ... I ca n't picture the end result -LRB- of a kidnapping -RRB- being adoption. She added: `` People have used babies as fronts for illegal activities ... children are being sold for drugs.'' Detectives were looking at other theories as well, including abduction by a pedophile, an adult who has abnormal sexual desire for children, or simply by a person who wished a child harm. Investigators had ruled out ransom as a motive, saying no one had contacted the families for money. `` We're going over everything with a fine-tooth comb because we really have nothing to go on, and just have to dig, dig, dig,'' <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Military forensic experts today began identifying the remains of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 15 others who were killed when their plane crashed into a cliff in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The bodies arrived in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital Tuesday evening. Helicopters were used to remove them from the wreckage of their light plane, a Twin Otter, on the steep slopes of mile-high Tam mountain. Seven Ethiopians and nine Americans _ including <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who chaired the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger _ died in the crash Aug. 7 en route to a refugee camp near the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> border. The plane crashed about 100 miles short of its destination. `` Ethiopian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities declare that all bodies have been recovered,'' Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> said later in a statement read to reporters. Additional medical personnel were to arrive in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> today to help the forensic experts already on hand identify the bodies before the Americans are returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for burial. <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> said the task of identifying the dead probably would take five to seven days. The work was being done at a clinic at <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>'s international airport. Members of an investigating team from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> flew to the crash site this morning to examine the wreckage for the cause of the accident. They included members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> companies, which made the airframe and engines of the Canadian-built Twin Otter. The Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> is coordinating the investigation. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, and his party were heading to the Fugnido refugee camp about 480 miles southwest of this capital when the accident occurred. Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have led to the crash. After a six-day search, rescuers Sunday found the wreckage and bodies strewn over about a quarter-mile wide region of the 5,500-foot mountain. The Fugnido camp is one of four in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. They house more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled war and famine in their neighboring country. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a six-term representative from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, was mourned as a champion of the homeless and hungry throughout the world. Funeral plans for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> include a memorial service to be held at 7:30 p.m. Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Mass will be said at 10 a.m. Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Private burial will take place at a later date.

 Pro-IRA activist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was deported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today after violating an order barring him from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> territory, the government said. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, publicity director for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION> NORAID </LOCATION>, was flown out of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flight heading to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the Home Office said. The 39-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer was arrested Tuesday in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, after taking a walk through the city on the 20th anniversary of the deployment of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops in the troubled province. `` He was flown out on a regular <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> flight to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said a spokesman for the Home Office, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. `` It was a point that we wanted him out of the country as soon as possible and the <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> had a plane available at about 5 a.m.'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has been banned from entering <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> territory since July 1984 when he gave a speech endorsing violence one day after a soldier was killed in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. A month later police tried to arrest him during a public appearance in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> fled, but a young man was killed by a plastic bullet fired by police trying to break up fighting in the crowd of Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> supporters. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> illegally on at least three other occasions. He said Tuesday he had been in the province for three days before police in bullet-resistant vests arrested him. He was flown Tuesday night to <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base <PERSON> Brize </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. During his walk, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was accompanied by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, and by several local <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> leaders. They openly walked past a security checkpoint on their way to the mainly Roman Catholic Bogside area of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> was not permitted to speak to lawyers before being deported, but would be challenging the exclusion order on his return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> NORAID </LOCATION> collects money to buy arms for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> denies this, saying the money goes to families of victims of violence in the province. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite the province and its Protestant majority with the predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule.

 An East German failed in an attempt to escape to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> when the truck he was driving flipped over after striking a border barrier, police said today. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said Communist East German border guards quickly surrounded the man and dragged him from the vehicle shortly before midnight Tuesday at the <PERSON> Stolpe </PERSON> crossing point between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Police said the truck appeared to be a military vehicle. They said that East German guards covered the truck with camouflage material at once to prevent onlookers from viewing it. The crossing was closed for a half-hour after the escape attempt was thwarted.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> officials were n't amused when a radio station offered prizes to listeners who used operator assistance to call the station during the telephone company's strike.

<HEAD>State Sues Exxon, Other Oil Companies Over Alaska Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a lawsuit, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and six other oil companies of deliberate and gross negligence in not preventing and properly cleaning up the nation's worst oil spill. The lawsuit does not specify damages, but could amount to billions of dollars, a state official said Tuesday. The state alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the subsidiary that owned the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, are responsible for the tanker running aground by failing to staff it adequately and supervise the crew properly. The lawsuit, filed in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, also says <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of oil companies that runs the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, failed to take prompt and adequate measures to contain and remove the spilled oil or prevent it from spreading into environmentally sensitive areas. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> was in charge of the initial response to the spill. The March 24 tanker disaster left nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` If you assume that the damages have n't been half mitigated and then you add in any potential punitive damages, this is probably in the multiple billions,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LeResche </PERSON>, the state oil-spill coordinator who announced the lawsuit at a news conference. The lawsuit names <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> and each of the consortium companies: <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary; <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipelines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Those companies controlled <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>'s budget to a degree that makes them responsible for <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the spill, the lawsuit says `` We feel that <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> as a corporation was merely a sham, a corporate shell if you will, behind which these partners have been hiding for the last 12 or 15 years,'' <PERSON> LeResche </PERSON> said. The lawsuit also charges that the oil companies misrepresented their ability to contain and clean up oil spills, violated federal marine pilotage laws and inflicted `` severe emotional distress on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> residents.'' In a statement issued at its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it had not seen the complaint `` but it appears to completely disregard the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the accident has been massive and responsible.'' `` Our goal continues to be to leave the water and shorelines in an environmentally stable condition such that animals, birds and fish are not harmed and no restrictions on commerical use or subsistence hunting and fishing are necessary,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for destruction of the environment and harm to the region's fisheries-based economy. `` The state recognizes that more than 1,000 square miles of its lands, waters and resources in or near <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> suffered severe environmental damage, including the devastation of beaches and coastal waters, the death or injury of thousands of animals, the curtailment of important commercial fisheries, and the impairment of recreational opportunities,'' a state news release said. The lawsuit seeks punitive damages, its cleanup costs, its costs of studying and monitoring the spill, and a negligence fine under state law of up to $ 100 million. The state also asks for an injunction to ensure <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> continue the cleanup until the environment is restored. <PERSON> LeResche </PERSON> said he expected the lawsuit would take a decade to resolve.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Genda </PERSON>, one of the chief planners of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surprise attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, has died of heart failure in a hospital, his family said <PERSON> Genda </PERSON>, who died Tuesday on the anniversary of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender in World War II, would have been 85 today. A graduate of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s naval academy, he was a young aviation staff officer who was called in early to plan for the daring attack that severely damaged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fleet in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and brought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into the war. He directed much of the secret training in Japanese waters before the attack and, on Dec. 7, 1941, <PERSON> Genda </PERSON> was aboard one of the Japanese carriers that launched the raid. In June 1942, however, he was involved with the unsuccessful Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Some analysts partially faulted him for failing to order enough search planes to find the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet in the assault. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense of Midway ended with many Japanese warships sunk or damaged in one of the great sea battles of modern times. After the war, <PERSON> Genda </PERSON> joined <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s revived air force in 1954 and became its chief of staff in 1959. After retiring from the military, he was elected in 1962 to the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and was re-elected three times before he retired in 1986. Regarded as a hawk among the ruling party's defense experts, <PERSON> Genda </PERSON> said in 1968 that if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had possessed an atom bomb it should have used one during the war. <PERSON> Genda </PERSON> was a native of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, the western city that was leveled in the first atomic attack on Aug. 6, 1945.

<HEAD>Estonian President Meets with Kremlin Leaders on Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders met today with the president of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to consider ways to end a weeklong strike by Russians complaining of discrimination in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, Soviet media said. The strike by tens of thousands of ethnic Russians and other non-Estonians is in response to a new law that limits the right to vote and hold office to long-term residents of the small republic. The workers are also upset about a new law requiring many of them to learn to speak Estonian. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-democracy group that also has been a moving force behind pro-Estonian changes in the republic, called for a national law guaranteeing the rights of minorities, the labor newspaper Trud reported today. `` We will be living together for a long time and if the tension keeps increasing, our lives and that of our children will be intolerable,'' the group's statement said. While Estonian President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON> met in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> with the ruling council of the Soviet government, a group of parliamentarians toured Estonian factories and spoke with workers, strike committee member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> said. The legislators met Tuesday night with the strike committee, <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Maarika </PERSON> <PERSON> Saarna </PERSON>, an editor with Estonian state radio, said from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> Tuesday night that 26,000 workers at about 40 enterprises were believed to be on strike. <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> said tens of thousands of workers at 50 enterprises were involved. The walkout has paralyzed rail cargo around <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s capital <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said more than 3,000 rail cars were idle while Pravda said 2,000. To assure that necessary supplies get to the city of 480,000, goods are being shipped to other cities in the republic, Pravda quoted the republic's deputy premier, <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palu </PERSON>, as saying. `` That way, we'll supply <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> with everything needed,'' <PERSON> Palu </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s new election law limits voting to adults who have lived in the same district for two years, or anywhere in the republic for five years. Candidates for elected office must live in the same place for five years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said the law will take the right to vote away from more than 100,000 recent non-Estonian arrivals. That was the aim of backers of the law, who fear an influx of outsiders is making ethnic Estonians a minority in their homeland. However, Estonian journalists said the number of people affected was 10,000 to 20,000, since most of the republic's non-Estonians have lived in the republic more than two years.

 The 17-year-old nephew of jailed businessman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> offered today to take his place if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would allow <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for his mother's funeral. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 53, has been held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> as an alleged spy for nearly four years, and his family and the British government have appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to let him attend the funeral on Saturday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, offered to go to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as collateral for his uncle. `` I am a little scared, obviously, because I have never been to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but my father has been there three times,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` He has had no problems with the Iranians. They have treated him well. I can not see any reason why they would not treat me properly.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said his son's offer was contained in an appeal he sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` If they wanted a surety that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> would return to jail, since officially he is still a spy or is being held for who knows what, I have said my son, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, would be happy to go as surety,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` That was <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s own proposal when we discussed the matter a couple of days ago.'' He said the move was a personal initiative rather than one approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is very important to us that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> is at his mother's funeral,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said `` She is the woman who brought him into this world. She has been a wonderful mother.'' Their mother, Dr. <PERSON> Rosaleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, died Aug. 3. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who had lived in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for more than 20 years, was detained in November 1985 and formally charged with espionage one year later.

<TEXT>
 Vietnamese boat people were rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel whose former captain was punished for not picking up refugees who later resorted to cannibalizing dead shipmates, officials said today. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, an amphibious transport ship, brought 30 Vietnamese into <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> on Monday after rescuing them from a wooden boat in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> early Sunday. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, now commanded by Capt. D.L. <PERSON> Wetherwell </PERSON>, was permitted to put the refugees ashore on the embassy's guarantee that the Vietnamese would be resettled in another country within 90 days, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Wetherwell </PERSON> would not be interviewed about the rescue, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who was not certain whether the present crew members were aboard in June 1988 when the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> gave food and water to Vietnamese refugees but left them to continue sailing on their own. The skipper at that time, Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, was tried by court-martial in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and found guilty Feb. 24 of dereliction of duty for failing to recognize their distress or act to see that they survived. The case highlighted the mariner's code that requires giving help to a vessel in distress and the dangers faced by Vietnamese boat people, who risk death in storms, by starvation and at the hands of pirates. In the 1988 incident, the refugees had been drifting without engine power for several weeks. Eighteen days after the Dubuque sailed away, Filipino fishermen found the disabled boat, and survivors said 31 people had died. The survivors later admitted they had cannibalized the dead. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was relieved of his command before his court-martial. His conviction resulted in a reprimand and he was transferred to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Sunday, the Dubuque's crew spotted a wooden, 35-foot refugee boat about 460 miles north-northeast of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said. The boat, carrying 23 adults and seven children, was out of food and fresh water and low on fuel, he said, and some of the refugees were suffering from dehydration. The vessel was determined not to be seaworthy, and the refugees were taken aboard the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, the official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship then brought them to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where it was making a routine port call.

 A 2-year-old boy allegedly abducted by his father when he was 17 days old has been reunited with his mother after a passerby spotted him hiding in the back seat of a parked car, officials said. The child's father, who was arrested along with two other men, took the boy after his wife fled a religious cult to which they belonged, authorities said. The boy's mother, 25-year-old <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinzetl </PERSON>, wept as she described her ordeal Tuesday at a news conference. `` I thought I'd never see him again,'' she said as the boy, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, munched fistfuls of candy from a paper cup. She said she lives in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, but would not disclose her hometown. The child's father, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, 27, allegedly ran off with <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> in August 1987 after <PERSON> Weinzetl </PERSON> fled the group, which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators call a cult. <PERSON> Aurthorities </PERSON> said the group is known as the <ORGANIZATION> Holiness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Alma, Ark. <PERSON> Weinzetl </PERSON>'s daughter from an earlier marriage, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, now 3, was returned to her by <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> five months after she left the group. But she says he refused to let her see <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> and eventually went into hiding with him.

<TEXT>
 Housing construction continued to rebound from the depressing effects of high mortgage rates with a 0.8 percent increase in new starts last month, the government reported today. This could mean more jobs in the construction and building materials industries, and additional employment and sales in such housing-related businesses as home furnishings and appliances. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that new homes and apartments were built in July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million units, up from 1.42 million units in June when the rebound began. The housing industry had been among the sectors hardest hit earlier this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> drove interest rates up to restrain economic growth and contain inflation. Construction starts had fallen for four consecutive months through May, the longest string of declines since activity slowed for five months in a row from February through June 1987. The May level of 1.31 million units was the slowest pace since the 1.3 million rate in December 1982. But the central bank began nudging rates down in June and, in anticipation of that move, fixed-rate mortgages began falling from their peak of 11.22 percent in March. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said fixed rates had dropped to 9.96 percent by last Friday. The July construction pace followed a hefty 8.5 percent hike in June, the highest since a 8.6 percent jump to 1.51 million units in February 1988. But June's increase reflected a 32.9 percent rise in the volatile apartment construction, the highest since a 43 percent increase in April 1988. Apartment construction last month fell 1.2 percent to an annual rate of 389,000 units. It had increased 5.4 percent in May after falling 26.6 percent in April. Construction of single-family homes in July rose 6.3 percent to an annual rate of 1.04 million units. Single-family starts had risen 0.2 percent in June after falling 5.1 percent in May and 4.7 percent in April. Analysts had expected single-family construction to remain weak as the economy continued to slow, causing a buildup in unsold new homes. By region, overall housing construction jumped by 16 percent last month in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 196,000 units. Starts were up 11 percent to 272,000 units in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> but fell 4.3 percent to 530,000 units in the South and 4.2 percent to 432,000 units in the West. Applications for building permits, a barometer of future multifamily housing activity, were down 3.1 percent in July, following a drop of 2.9 percent in June. They had risen 1 percent in May and 8.5 percent in April after three consecutive monthly declines.

 An anti-apartheid youth leader freed last week from detention was shot and killed outside his home today, his family said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON>, 27, was released from custody Friday after a prolonged hunger strike.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said today he hopes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can reach an agreement to keep its military bases in this country, but he said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will find other host nations if necessary. The lease on the six military installations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base, expires in 1991. Many Filipinos, including lawmakers, have said it should not be renewed. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was scheduled to meet later today with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. She has not stated her position on the issue. `` If they come to the conclusion that it is to the best interest of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to permit us to continue using the facilities, then we will gladly and willingly continue to utilize them,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. He added, however, that the American government would develop `` operative facilities elsewhere'' in case the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> decides to close the bases. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, who is chairman of the Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs subcommittee in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in this country today with Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., and <ORGANIZATION> Eni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faleomavaega </ORGANIZATION>, a legislator from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> In other comments to reporters, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s proposal to host some American forces was a `` constructive offer'' _ but not a substitute for the bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> extended its offer earlier this month. However, Defense Minister <PERSON> Tengku </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rithauddeen </PERSON> of neighboring <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> said the proposal could jeopardize political stability in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Some Filipino opponents of the bases, wary of the heavy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence, have suggested the facilities could instead be used for such things as commercial ship repair and industrial parks. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are expected to begin talks this year on whether to extend the current agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is expected to discuss the issue during a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November. In October, the two countries reached an agreement allowing the bases to remain until 1991 in return for $ 962 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic aid over two years. About 40,000 American troops, civilian workers and military dependents are stationed at the facilities.

 Dozens of people injured by the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> were back home today after receiving treatment by Israeli medical experts. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 61 people injured in the earthquake arrived aboard an Israeli airliner Tuesday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of the Armenian republic. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said some patients had received artificial limbs during their seven weeks of care in Israeli hospitals. At least 25,000 people were killed, 31,000 were injured and more than 100,000 left homeless in the earthquake that decimated large areas of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Dec. 7. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that Soviet television said the flight `` meant the end of operation ` Healing.''' `` The passengers of today's unusual flight spent seven weeks in the best Israeli hospitals,'' the agency said. `` Very complicated operations were made on them, and they received prosthetic appliances produced according to the latest methods in medical science and engineering.''

<HEAD>Daily Says U.S. Must Condemn Israel and Release Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Iranian newspaper said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can only improve ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for `` acts of terrorism'' and releasing frozen Iranian assets. The same daily newspaper said Tuesday that the release of Iranian assets would not guarantee Iranian help in freeing Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups. In an editorial today, the <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has shown `` substantial restraint'' on the hostage issue but that is not enough to improve ties between the nations. The editorial, reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, echoed a statement Monday by an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, that there is no chance for talks between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian leaders. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` can demonstrate its wisdom, farsightedness and pragmatic approach just by taking two simple actions: 1. Condemn <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for its acts of terrorism, and 2. Release Iranian assets,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> said. Billions of dollars in Iranian assets, mostly undelivered military equipment, were frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after Iranian extremists seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage. The hostages were held 444 days. There are 16 Westerners, including eight Americans, held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday the Iranians have it in their power to get American hostages released and rejoin the `` family of law abiding'' nations. But he has said there can be no link between unfreezing Iranian assets and releasing the hostages. <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` pin hopes on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s assistance'' to free the hostages `` without respecting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s conditions is wishful thinking It said the release of Iranian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` be taken only as a goodwill gesture,'' not as a trade-off for help in freeing the hostages. The plight of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages was pushed to the fore after Israeli commandos July 28 kidnapped <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem cleric from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said it wanted to trade him for the Western hostages and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In response, a group called the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claimed it had hanged an American hostage, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Another pro-Iranian group threatened to kill another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage but later suspended the threat. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. In another development today, the 17-year-old nephew of jailed British businessman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> offered to take his place if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would allow <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for his mother's funeral. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 53, has been held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on spy charges for nearly four years, and his family and the British government have appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to let him attend the funeral on Saturday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, offered to go to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as collateral for his uncle.

<TEXT>
 The government of new Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> has more public support than the previous administration, but its approval rating remains below 50 percent, according to results of a poll released today. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has pinned its hopes for recovering its popularity on <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, who became prime minister Aug. 9. His predecessor, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, resigned after only 69 days in office following the party's heavy losses in July 23 elections for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said 46.5 percent of those responding to a poll conducted last week approved of <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s new administration, compared with 35.5 percent who supported the Uno Cabinet when it was formed on June 2. Forty-three percent of respondents said they disapproved of <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s administration, compared to 49 percent who opposed the Uno Cabinet, it added. It said the poll showed support for the conservative governing party rose 9.6 percentage points from June to 40.8 percent, while support for the biggest victor in the elections, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, rose 5.3 percentage points to a record 33.8 percent. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s initial support rating was the third lowest since <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> began conducting approval polls in the 1960s, the news agency said. The lowest rating for a newly formed Cabinet was for the administration of <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, formed in November 1976, it said. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, began his administration with a support rating of 58.6 percent in November 1987, but that dropped to an all-time low of 3.9 percent in April of this year, largely because of a stock-trading scandal that forced him to resign. Asked why they supported the <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration, the largest number of respondents, 28.9 percent, said there was no other appropriate person for the post, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. The main reason given for opposing the new government, cited by 33.7 percent of respondents, was that it was backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said 3,000 eligible voters were contacted in the poll, conducted Aug. 11-12, and 1,968 responded.

 <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ the self-annointed hotel queen portrayed in court as a tight-fisted tyrant _ had no friends, a former aide says. That was exactly what Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s lawyer wanted the jury to hear. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, is charged with evading about $ 1 million in federal taxes by charging about $ 4 million in personal expenses to <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> businesses. Her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, 80, was previously ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial. Defense attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> has sought to show that the couple were entitled to bill <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> businesses for expenses at their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion because they used it to do work and entertain business associates. <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> on Tuesday opened his case by calling Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s former personal assistant, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, to the stand <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> had also testified for the prosecution. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her husband spent most of their time on the weekends working at <LOCATION> Dunnellen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. He said they read correspondence, financial reports and other business documents. `` Mr. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, did the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> have any personal friends?'' <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> asked. `` No,'' he replied. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said he once presented <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> with a stack of financial reports and told <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> they might put him to sleep. `` Put me to sleep? This is the most exciting reading I can get,'' he said <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> replied. Previous witnesses had portrayed Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> as an abusive boss who extorted kickbacks from liquor suppliers, did n't pay her bills and forced suppliers to charge personal expenses to her business. Even her attorney conceded she was `` demanding'' and `` abrasive.'' Also Tuesday, U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> reserved decision on whether to admit an accounting report that <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> says shows the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> are actually owed $ 681,000 in tax refunds in 1983-85, the years charged in the indictment. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said the defense gave him a copy on Monday. He complained that the documents should have been turned over much earlier under the rules of evidence. The judge admonished <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> for not furnishing the material earlier. `` To me, it is inexcusable and I ca n't understand why it did n't happen,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> fans marking the 12th anniversary of his death filed solemnly past his pool-side grave in a candlelight procession early today. The vigil, which began Tuesday night, drew 3,000 to 4,000 participants, police said. The affair is the largest single event of <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION>, a nine-day lineup of concerts, memorials and fan get-togethers. Presley died of heart disease on Aug. 16, 1977. He is buried next to the swimming pool at his white-columned estate, Graceland. Participants in the vigil marched single file up the quarter-mile drive at <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION>, carrying tapers lighted from a torch fired from an eternal flame at Presley's graveside. Many left roses by the simple marker. Devotees began lining up at <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION>'s distinctive gates _ decorated with musical notes and a rendering of <LOCATION> Elvis </LOCATION> _ five to six hours before the procession. By the time the ceremony began, the highway in front of the mansion was filled with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fans, more than a few with Elvis-style metallic sunglasses, spangled belts or jet-black hairdos. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Campione </PERSON>, 6, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, wore a green jumpsuit with a white cape as he posed for snapshots, striking karate poses a la Elvis. `` I love <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. He was kind and generous and I like his music,'' the boy said. His mother, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, said her son was entered in an Elvis impersonator contest at a local nightclub. The graveside vigil has been sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> for 11 years. The club has more than 1,200 members worldwide, many of them too young to have been Presley fans when he was alive, said club president <PERSON> Georganna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` One reason for a fan club is to pass the torch, to keep the candle burning,'' she said. The 7-year-old Tribute Week is organized by the managers of Graceland, which draws 650,000 visitors a year, including some 40,000 during the anniversary celebration. Presley bought the three-story residence in 1957 when his rock' n' roll career began to take off. It was opened to the public in 1982. Graceland and its 36,000-square-foot souvenir shopping center across the highway take in some $ 12 million a year and are run for the benefit of <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s only child, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Announce Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mozambican rebel forces have issued a peace plan saying they would rather participate in elections than carry on their 12-year-old battle to oust the government by force. Their 16-point plan, released in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> Tuesday, represented an answer to an earlier proposal by the Mozambican government of President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>. The rebel plan said neither the rebels nor the government would gain from continued fighting. `` It is not <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to change the existing order in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> through armed force,'' said the two-page document, referring to the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym for the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>. `` The armed struggle is just a last recourse in the defense of the people against the negation of their rights,'' the two-page document said. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting the Marxist-oriented government since <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1977. The war has killed an estimated 600,000 people. The rebel proposal followed a week of discussions that began Aug. 8 in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> and a delegation of Mozambican Roman Catholic and protestant church leaders. During the talks, the church officials presented a 12-point peace plan from the Mozambican government. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Afonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON> said the rebel proposal was a response to <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s offer, which was never made public. In its proposal, <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the southeast <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation and urged `` genuine'' peace negotiations be held. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many other Western countries have been providing non-military aid to the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government, which continues to get the bulk of its arms from Soviet bloc. Some Western countries, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, provide some security assistance. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> has large number of troops in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> helping the government fight the war. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said recently he has accepted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s word that it no longer aids the rebels. However, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> still believes the rebels receive help from non-governmental groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said the rebels want negotiations toward `` a national reconciliation without winners or losers'' that would `` finally end in peace.'' <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>'s other proposals included a call for its own recognition `` as a political force,'' an end to verbal attacks by <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s government and general elections The guerrilla proposal also stated <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to human rights abuses. `` Renamo is a guerrilla force whose survival depends only on the people, therefore it is by nature against any atrocity that risks the lives of the people, its reason for being,'' said the document. The rebels have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians while seeking food or new recruits. In an English-language news release accompanying the proposal, <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON> said the church leaders and rebels addressed the withdrawal of foreign troops and possible ways of ending the conflict. The closed-door meetings between church leaders and rebels were held under Kenyan government auspices. The <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> talks followed <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s request to Presidents <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> to mediate an end to conflict in the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is one of the world's poorest countries. An estimated 6 million of its 15 million people receive food aid.

<HEAD>Guardian Angels Win Award for Subway Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group formed to promote solutions to social problems today honored the Guardian Angels for their patrols on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway and said they led authorities to improve security on the system. `` Whatever the government's reservations about this group may be, they have had a salutary effect on the authorities, who have been shamed into placing more police on the Underground system as a result,'' said the citation from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventions </ORGANIZATION>. `` Rigorously self-disciplined, unpaid and imaginatively trained, they are visibly succeeding not only in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but in other cities,'' it said. The Guardian Angels began patrolling the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway in May, wearing their trademark T-shirts and red berets. They underwent three months of training supervised by the organization's American founder, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>. British police and government officials opposed the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> setting up in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, saying law enforcement should be left to professionals. But after their arrival, the government said it would temporarily assign an additional 80 police officers to patrol the subway system. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on the award. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventions </ORGANIZATION> each year gives out 12 awards worth a total of $ 1,500 to groups or individuals who come up with `` new and imaginative ideas to improve the quality of life.''

<HEAD>Palestinians Call for Strikes to Protest Identity Cards</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today called for a two-week boycott of jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest new computerized identity cards for day laborers. The call came one day after leaflets distributed by activists in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> also told day laborers there to strike for a week to protest the measure imposed on the Gazans. Palestinians in the occupied territories were already in the second day of a separate general strike today. Shops, offices and many schools remained closed for the strike, which was called to mark a prison riot last year that left two Palestinians dead. The new strikes are to start Friday, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it will start enforcing the new identity card system. An estimated 50,000 Gazans and 60,000 West Bank Arabs work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and play an important role in its economy. On Tuesday, an Israeli truck driver was charged with manslaughter and reckless driving in the deaths of four <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, 1987. Riots touched off by the traffic deaths are viewed as the beginning of the uprising. In renewed violence today, five Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Slogans spray-painted on walls in the coastal <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, signed by leaders of the 20-month-old uprising, urged the day laborers to stay away from their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to defy its efforts to control them by requiring the cards. The government began to issue the computerized identity cards two months ago to try to control the movement of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> day laborers. The move came after the kidnapping and killing of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and other attacks by Gazans on Jews inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Cards are denied to anyone with a criminal record or who is considered a security risk. The work boycott could result in a permanent loss of jobs for many of the Palestinians. Israeli employers have been under growing pressure to replace Palestinian workers with Israelis, both for security reasons and to reduce domestic unemployment. Earlier, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists launched a campaign to sabotage the identity card operation, urging Palestinians to reject the cards. The charges against the 29-year-old Israeli truck driver, <PERSON> Herzl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokovza </PERSON>, were delayed for 20 months because of police investigations and a backlog in the courts, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Etty </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON> said. According to witnesses, <PERSON> Bokovza </PERSON>'s truck collided with a car carrying <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> laborers from the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing all four Arabs in the car. Rumors spread through the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that the truck had intentionally run over the workers, and rioting broke out.

 A decorated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent whose undercover work goes back to the French Connection days was himself arrested in a sting by colleagues after he allegedly walked into a setup carrying 62 pounds of cocaine. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> devised some of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s best undercover operations during an 18-year career, said fellow Agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who described himself as a friend of <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 44, was arrested late Monday at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> while delivering suitcases filled with cocaine to informants, authorities said. `` This is a very sad, sad moment in drug enforcement,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> worked together in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> trying to uncover heroin labs in the 1970s. `` Those were the hotbeds of activity in the French Connection days,'' he said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s knowledge of how sting operations worked made his arrest particularly difficult. To conduct the sting that netted <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> used private citizens who cooperated with the agency, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` You're dealing with someone in every respect who would be knowledgeable of everything,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> headed the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> office from 1982 to 1988 and received a special citation from Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1984 for supervising a crackdown on a major cocaine ring in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Before his arrest <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> worked at agency headquarters in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, helping set up a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> museum, said spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Festa </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> has been placed on leave. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> received the cocaine earlier Monday from an informant in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> received $ 14,000 to transport the drugs and was expecting to receive another $ 14,000 on delivery in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and could get 10 years in prison and fines up to $ 4 million if convicted, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s brothers <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> were arrested Tuesday and charged with conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Bourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, were held pending a bail hearing Thursday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, of Sandwich, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was released on $ 25,000 bail. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said that in July, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, under <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> surveillance, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, obtained about 55 pounds of cocaine and sham cocaine and brought it to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for $ 25,000.

 Four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jets came dangerously close to colliding with a Spanish commercial jetliner carrying 50 people, an aviation official said today. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Yus </PERSON>, the director of air traffic at <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION>'s airport, said the incident occurred the afternoon of Aug. 10 when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> A-10A Warthog jets were returning to the air base at <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Aviaco </ORGANIZATION> jet was approaching to land. The air base and <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION> airport share a landing strip.

The normal climbing speed is 500 feet per minute. `` It was clearly a dangerous situation because neither the airline pilot nor air traffic controllers had been informed of the jets' flight, and they were not in contact with the tower,'' <PERSON> Yus </PERSON> said. The American jets, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> anti-tank aircraft normally stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, were at the <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION> base to practice firing at nearby Bardenas Real training range, he said.

 A principal who cut his own job so teachers would not be laid off is back at work after an outpouring of support from townspeople.

Even Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose cuts in state aid have been blamed for much of the town's financial problems, telephoned. `` He asked if there was any way he could help get me back into the job,'' <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> said. `` I told him that my concern was not that, but what we are going to do to preserve good schools.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Announce Major Opposition Unity Conference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid leaders today announced plans for a national conference aimed at unifying opposition to the government. They called on foreign countries to ensure the meeting was not banned. Organizers of the `` historic conference'' on Oct. 7 include Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, black miners' union leader <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, co-president of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition. `` The aim of the conference will be to map out the most effective, shortest path to the ending of oppression and exploitation, and the creation of a democratic country,'' the organizers said in a statement. `` We expect the conference to be attended by thousands of delegates from all walks of life, representing millions of poeple.'' A similar broad-based, anti-apartheid conference was scheduled to be held in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> last year but was banned by the government. Predicting another ban this year, the conference organizers said, `` We are alerting the international community to monitor the actions of the regime in relation to this gathering of the people.'' They said officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had been briefed about the conference, to be held in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` The current mood of our people is such that we believe they will defy any attempt by the state to prevent the conference from going ahead,'' the organizers said. They noted that a nationwide defiance campaign already was under way, challenging various segregation laws as the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections approach. The organizers said any group would be welcome to join the conference which shared support for seven basic demands. These were a one-person, one-vote political system, lifting of the state of emergency, unconditional release of political prisoners, unbanning of political organizations, freedom of association and expression, press freedom, and a `` living wage'' for all workers. The announcement made no mention of the forced resignation of P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> this week and the appointment of F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as acting president. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has promised a five-year program to bring the black majority into the political structure, but activists say his proposal is too vague and too slow. The specific issue which triggered <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s split with his Cabinet was the planned trip by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> on Aug. 28 to confer with <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, a vehement critic of apartheid <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, foreign affairs spokesman for the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, today described <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> as `` an outspoken enemy of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' and urged de Klerk to call off the meeting. If the meeting takes place, <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> should `` give a public assurance that no internal affairs will be discussed.'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> in effect would be representing the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Parliament today elected as its new speaker <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, a middle-ranking clergyman who has been instrumental in trying to export <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution to other Moslem countries. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said 145 of the 243 deputies at today's vote supported <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, who has long experience in the Majlis, or <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was appointed deputy speaker last year to <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who had served as speaker since 1980. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> resigned Tuesday to take over the presidency, which he won with 94.5 percent of the vote last month. As head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> has been a leader in the movement to spread <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist revolution.

He was sometimes criticized for his obsession with bringing relief to the starving people of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; his detractors said he should have concentrated on the hungry people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instead. But <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> had an answer for that: `` I am as much a citizen of this world as I am of my country,'' he said. `` To hell with those people who are critical of what I am able to do to help save people's lives. I do n't mean to sound hokey but I grew up on a Christian ethic which says we are supposed to help the least of our brothers.''

 Aug. 15 St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> on the death of Congressman <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>: <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, died last week in the country that was birth to his mission as a politician. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Representative from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> had always fought on behalf of people in need, but in 1983 he toured <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and was shaken by the desolation and deprivation he saw visited upon the people there. When he returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, ... <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> began his crusade to create a select committee on hunger. That committee, with ... <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> at its head, has been the conscience of the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ not just concerning famine relief for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but the plight of the poor in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... The impetus behind the formation of the hunger committee was a trip to an Ethopian refugee camp, where a little girl died before his eyes from the hunger that consumed her. It was on his fifth trip to such refugee camps that his plane crashed. The tributes to him from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, from House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, from activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> go properly to one who, in ... <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s words, `` represented the best in compassion that we as a nation possess.''

 Aug. 14 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on babies without brains: In a civilized society, doctors trying to save life can not be allowed to profane the dying. Yet that's just what the medical community would do if it comes out on the wrong side of the debate involving brain-absent babies and organ transplants. Although the debate involves a small number of potential organ donors _ fewer than 200 brain-absent babies are born alive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year _ it has far-reaching implications. By the time an anencephalic baby dies, usually within a few days of birth, its organs often have deteriorated to the point that they are not usable for transplant purposes. Those who want to speed up the process, by declaring living children dead and maintaining them on life-support systems until their organs are needed, would do a terrible thing. A disturbing report appeared recently in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Authors argued that anencephalic babies are not alive, and that doctors should therefore be allowed to ignore the usual standards of brain death in order to use such an infant's organs earlier. The suggestion is chilling. What Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truog </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and bioethicist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> propose is the creation of an artificially sustained class of ever-ready organ donors. ... Currently, most transplant centers will not traffic in anencephalic organs, because such donors are not considered dead under standards set by either states or medical societies. With today's technological advances, however, doctors have the ability to blur the fine line between life and death, morality and immorality. Those who misuse brain-absent babies leap across that line. The precedent such transplants would set would be devastating. If doctors succeed in keeping brain-absent babies alive on machines until their organs are needed, it's not much of a jump for them to consider the same fate for comatose adults, or anyone else the medical community has given up on.

They also want bills itemized to clearly indicate services directed to children aged 12 and under. It's a good theory on the surface. And in reality, it's not feasible to expect one company, which only provides the lines and billing for the information providers, to excuse all bills claimed to be made by a child. If that were the case, a precedent would be set for erasing responsibility for what our children do. It would also teach children the lesson that they can get away with irresponsible behavior because their parents will get them out of it. Temptations such as 900 recordings are here to stay, and until blocking is available on all telephone companies, large phone bills are a danger. Parents must teach their children to make responsible choices and take the consequences when they do n't.

 Aug. 11 The Register-Guard, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on airline deregulation: The current financial state of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s domestic airline industry can be summed up in four words: profits up, bargains down. The relatively few airlines that made it through the post-deregulation chaos are reporting record profits. The good news for the industry, however, translates into bad news for travelers. Fares are up _ by more than 15 percent in the past year. And discounts, frequent flier programs and other enticements ... are fewer and more restrictive. More disturbing, however, is the fact that only eight airlines _ <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAIR </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> _ control more than 90 percent of the domestic market. That concentration of market control is the antithesis of what deregulation was supposed to be all about. ... The free market has worked and the fittest have survived, but at what cost to those companies that died along the way and those cities that no longer have air service?

Sunday was the 44th anniversary of the first atomic bomb attack on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> carried out by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> B-29 bomber. And Wednesday was the same for the second and the world's last nuclear attack to date.

Three days later nearly half that amount lost their lives at <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. Those two days did as much as anything in this century to change the course of the world. While the attacks resulted in a swift end to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> involvement in World War II, it was the beginning of the atomic age, the nuclear age. And it was the beginning of awareness of the power of nuclear energy and the horror of it if used improperly. Every day the world lives in fear of a nuclear holocaust. Will it ever happen? No one can know, but the sheer thought of it should never leave the minds of those who are in global decision-making positions.

<HEAD>Dockworkers Refuse to Handle Toxic Wastes From Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Port owners and dockworkers today refused to unload Canadian toxic waste from a Soviet freighter, despite assurances from the environment minister that it poses no pollution or health risks. The freighter <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhova </PERSON> was carrying polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> when it docked at <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The cargo was to have been sent to a special high-temperature incinerator in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Mersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Docks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow the PCBs to be unloaded and said the ship will return to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after unloading other cargo. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Tilbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> at the mouth of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> refused to handle a separate consignment of PCBs from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and another Soviet freighter had to take them back to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. PCBs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers, but have been banned in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because they have been linked with cancer. Regarding the ship in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, a dock company spokesman said: `` The ship will be discharging and unloading other cargo and sailing tonight.'' A dockers' spokesman, who also requested anonymity in keeping with British custom, said: `` We did not know how serious it was until it was brought to light recently and became a political football.'' The <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> port's refusal to handle the PCBs follows a wave of protests from residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Rechem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> incinerator is located, and from the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental group. About 100 protestors greeted the ship when it arrived at the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaforth </LOCATION> Container Terminal four hours later than scheduled because of bad weather in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The environment secretary, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> dockers had `` no reason whatsoever'' to fear the cargo on environmental grounds. He said government regulations, tightened following a toxic waste controversy last year, ensured the Canadians PCBs were safe to handle. `` There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds these cargoes should not be handled,'' he said. `` After all, the port has been handling these cargoes safely for some time.'' <PERSON> Rechem </PERSON> has a contract to dispose of a total of 13 consignments of wastes to be shipped from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in the coming weeks. Company spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said its lawyers are studying the contract, although Rechem is not considering legal action `` at this stage.'' Rechem, he said, will `` defend our position.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has only one incinerator capable of disposing of PCBs. It is located in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> and does not accept wastes from other provinces. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> tightened its regulations for accepting chemical wastes last year after a ship containing 2,000 tons of toxic waste, including PCBs, was banned from docking. The <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>, a West German vessel, was carrying Italian wastes which had been illegally dumped in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. The wastes were ordered removed from the African country and were rejected by several European nations before being finally accepted back by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 Two minor parties today endorsed the idea of a coalition government led by the Solidarity movement, strengthening <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s bid to create the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which hold the balance of power in the Polish legislature, said they would back a Solidarity-led coalition. `` We have entered a period of an open fight for power,'' <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers today. `` The situation is dangerous, but it is not time to put up our hands'' in surrender, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted him as saying. A Soviet diplomat expressed concern over the developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would not interfere. The governing crisis that threatens to interrupt more than four decades of communist rule began with the party's crushing losses in June parliamentary elections, the most democratic balloting in the country since World War II. Huge gains made by the Solidarity-led opposition hampered communist efforts to form a coalition government. On Monday, Communist Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said he was prepared to resign and abandon efforts to assemble a Cabinet in the face of Solidarity's opposition to any communist-led government. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> became prime minister 12 days ago. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> proposed a meeting of the country's main political leaders to find `` rational solutions,'' but there was no word on when the meeting might take place. Solidarity has said that only an opposition-led government will have the public support needed to deal with a deteriorating economy and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. The possibility that Solidarity may lead a new Polish government has worried Polish communists and the Soviets, who fear the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance could be threatened. A communist legislator who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> gave a `` very emotional'' speech today on the challenge to his party. `` What can you expect after such a lack of diplomacy by Solidarity?'' he said. `` Nobody in the world wants to give up power. And they want a government without communists. They could have power, but only by going step by step and not trying to turn it over all at once.'' In a bid to ease Soviet fears, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the Solidarity leader, on Tuesday promised that in any Solidarity-led government the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be given control of the `` sensitive'' ministries of defense and interior that control the army and internal police. It was possible communists could receive other ministries as well, union spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said today. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON>, said today that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement was `` very sensible ... In regard to the following, that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is a member of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and Solidarity should make the necessary conclusions as a result of that.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was `` very much concerned'' about the Polish situation but, `` We do n't interfere in the internal affairs of that country. The Polish people should decide themselves.'' A Polish communist official said the party `` will not take responsibility for the result'' if Solidarity forms a coalition government that excludes the communists. `` Every thinking man ... should realize that we are not a state of parliamentary democracy yet,'' party Secretary <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiatr </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Zycie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warszawy </ORGANIZATION>. `` Having a parliament majority in itself is not sufficient to exercise power.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> on Monday said he would turn over his unsuccessful attempt to form a `` grand coalition'' government to <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> has not publicly said if he wants to be a candidate for prime minister, and his own <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislators declared after meeting with him today that they `` fully support <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s initiative.'' In a resolution, they urged party leaders to `` quickly realize'' the <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> coalition plan, party spokesman <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON> declined to say what majority the resolution was supported by the 76 Peasant lawmakers, who make up the third-largest parliamentary delegation after the communists and Solidarity. <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> returned to party headquarters to meet with party leaders, he said. Meanwhile, the 27-member <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> caucus also met and with only one negative vote adopted a resolution supporting the Solidarity-led coalition, said their caucus leader, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Janowski </PERSON> said coalition talks with Solidarity started last week and while there had been no decision on whom to propose as prime minister, he understood the premier would come from Solidarity, the largest coalition partner. Deputy prime ministers would come from the two minor parties, he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Tuesday that he would serve as prime minister `` if society wishes it.'' But he said that he would prefer someone else take the office.

The Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, `` welcomes without any conditions the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution,'' said an <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> spokesman, who demanded anonymity. `` The resolution, as we understand it, is a package deal that involves not just a cease-fire, but also the lifting of blockades and planning the Syrian military pull-out from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman added. The spokesman did not elborate, and it was unclear if <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s welcoming of the truce was tantamount to accepting it The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution made no direct references to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or its blockade of the embattled Christian enclave. But it called on `` all the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and shelling on land and at sea.'' The resolution also called for `` the opening of the lines of communication and the lifting of the sieges.'' There was little fighting in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today after heavy artillery battles on Tuesday. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s statement was issued one day after the Syrian army and Moslem factions vowed to join forces to defeat the Christians. Sources today reported a buildup of troops and ammunition around the Christian heartland. There was no reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire demand from Syrian and Moslem forces. The 15-nation <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had called for the truce during an emergency meeting ordered by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> ministers also renewed their call for an end to the fighting. <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee members <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> called in a statement for `` an immediate and global'' cease-fire. Police said 19 people had been killed and 104 wounded in the fighting since Tuesday, when <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces fought Syrian troops with tanks and artillery along the southern, eastern and northern edges of the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners also pounded the 28-mile-long Christian coastline, the only escape route for the area's residents. By police count, 760 people have been killed and 2,050 wounded since the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war began March 8. Since then, shelling day and night has largely destroyed <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and driven out 90 percent of the city's 1.5 million residents. The fighting between the 20,000 mostly Christian troops under army <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers slackened early today to intermittent shelling. But Moslem security sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the Syrians were reinforcing their troops opposite <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s lines in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the central mountains and northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One source said, `` Syrian trucks were observed early in the day bringing in troops and ammunition to positions facing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s lines.'' He said <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla groups from Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, bankrolled by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, also sent reinforcements to their positions in the wooded mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> The buildup began after a seven-hour meeting in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> of the heads of virtually all <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fractious Moslem groups. The Syrians summoned their Moslem and leftist <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia leaders to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for a council of war in what appeared to be a move to escalate the campaign against the Christians. The leaders of 16 factions, including Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups and radical Palestinian guerrillas, attended. They issued a statement late Tuesday saying they would close ranks to bring down <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` The solution must be on the basis of ending the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, and blowing up the sectarian regime from its roots,'' it said. `` But to bring down <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is the priority, as well as blowing up all the imaginary red lines.'' The border of the Christian enclave is often referred to as a `` red line'' that would provoke international intervention if crossed by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces because it would represent a major escalation in the fighting. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has used its militia allies to do most of the ground fighting while Syrian artillery and armor provide support, giving <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> room for diplomatic maneuvering. International pressure was building for a cease-fire. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Tuesday from <LOCATION> Castelgondolfo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>: `` In the name of God, I turn to the Syrian authorities, asking them to stop the bombardment that aims to destroy ... the whole country.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called the emergency <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting when none of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 member nations acted. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter allows the secretary-general to call such meetings when international security appears in serious danger.

The <ORGANIZATION> NABJ </ORGANIZATION> objected to what it said was the derisive tone and terminology used by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and reporter <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> in a 1988 obituary on <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the first black network TV anchorman and a founder of <ORGANIZATION> NABJ </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> died of AIDS. In a letter to the network, two <ORGANIZATION> NABJ </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>'s introduction `` insinuated that Mr. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> contracted AIDS in a decadent, shameful fashion, though there were no facts reported to support that presumption. `` We reviewed our piece on <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and we remain convinced that it was fair and objective,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON>, speaking for NBC News. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> got the dubious designation in the print category for a May 8 column calling for a coalition `` to liberate black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from a worse enemy than the Klan ever was, the black criminal.'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> wrote that `` if a young black, or young white male, sidles up to ask directions, and one of the two is a robber, rapist or killer, the odds are at least 11-to-1 that it is the black male.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallos </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, said Tuesday that she would try to relay the news to him, but he had not commented by today.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today a new poll shows `` I'm off to a very good start,'' even though it found that more than half the people surveyed thought he is n't qualified to be president. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll found nearly a 2-1 approval ratio for the way <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is handling the vice presidency. However, 52 percent of those questioned said he was n't qualified to take over the presidency. `` I am very delighted to see that by a ratio of 2-1 Americans think I am doing a good job as vice president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today at a photo session. `` I feel I'm off to a very good start.'' Asked how he explained the 52 percent figure, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I tend to accentuate the positive and I have a very positive ratio of support with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of 2-1 on how I am doing the job. They approve of the way I am doing the job. That's good news for me.'' Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> dismissed the poll's findings. `` We think the public does have confidence in the vice president,'' he told reporters en route to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` thinks the vice president is doing an excellent job; he has outstanding qualities in many areas.'' Asked whether he had faith in public opinion polls, the spokesman said: `` I never believe in the bad ones.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> talked about the poll as he posed for pictures with <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, who is returning to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after serving as ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called it a `` final courtesy call'' and said the two would have `` a frank discussion.'' `` Clearly I will be giving him messages that he can take back to his government,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, the vice president's press secretary, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> raised concerns about human rights and `` what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have to do to improve its relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' in the aftermath of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy forces. The poll on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance was conducted by telephone with 1,022 people Aug. 4-8, about a year after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate. It showed little change from earlier polls that indicated a widespread lack of confidence in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications to take over the government in an emergency Fifty-two percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would n't be qualified to take over as president. Thirty-eight percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be president and the rest offered no opinion. Forty-three percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should seect another running mate if he runs for re-election. But the respondents had less trouble with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in his current job: 43 percent approved of the way he's handling the vice presidency, 22 percent disapproved and 34 percent said they did n't know The results were similar to national polls taken last spring that showed slightly more than half of those responding said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was not qualified to be president. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Post that his continued poor showing in polls is a result of last year's campaign in which Democrats attacked him as unprepared to step into the Oval Office. `` I do n't think people have the knowledge and information about me they do about the president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unconcerned with such poll results. `` The president likes the job he is doing,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. The results were sharply different for party members. Two-thirds of those who said they were Republicans approved of the job <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is doing, while only a third of the Democrats approved. The poll found 43 percent believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a mistake in selecting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, while 47 percent said it was not a mistake and the rest had no opinion. The survey has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

 Speakers at a civil rights convention today stressed the need for black participation in both the Republican and Democratic parties and urged voters to watch for persecution of black elected officials. `` We do n't want our folks singled out,'' said <PERSON> Spiver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a commissioner in <LOCATION> Greene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said at the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are concerned where there seems to be a special effort to prosecute African-American elected officials.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a national <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> board member, was convicted of vote fraud in a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe of election irregularities in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> had contended he was the victim of selective prosecution based on race, a charge denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON>, vice mayor of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, noted the absence of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> after the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's apparent courtship of black voters with Tuesday's appearance of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had been scheduled to appear. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> just has not offered the kind of sensitivity needed if we are going to participate,'' <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> said. At the same time, <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> cautioned Democrats not to assume blacks are satisfied with the party. `` We have been bludgeoned politically by Democrats,'' he said. He added it will be `` infinitely easier'' for blacks to progress in both parties. Civil rights leaders have been meeting with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over what they say is a trend toward overturning civil rights victories with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings. The group has said it intends to decide a course of action for `` reversing the assault on affirmative action and minority set-aside programs.'' The theme for this year's conference is `` Rebirth of Hope In The Struggle.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Tuesday told participants that recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings against affirmative action and minority set-asides do not reflect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attitude toward their cause. The crowd of about 500 board members and staffers applauded him enthusiastically at times and seemed cool at others. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said afterward he had `` no expectations going in there'' but felt good about the response. `` I know there are concerns among you,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` We will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> open and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> equal for all. `` We may differ from time to time as to the course this nation must travel, but we do not differ on the ultimate destination.'' Later, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declined to comment on what those differences were. Civil rights leaders have said they are focusing upon the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's actions, not its words. In introducing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` put some music'' behind the discussions. `` Let me take this opportunity to provide some music,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` This president has, in fact, gone beyond the rhetoric. ... Yes, we can do better and yes, we will do better. `` This is not rhetoric. This is not politics. This, my friends, is the right thing to do.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> referred to last week's appointment of Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and said the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> `` can rest assured we will not be deterred'' in reaching out to appoint blacks in the administration. `` I feel confident we can work together and build an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we all envision,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` There is no place for the Klan, neo-Nazis, skinheads or any other racist group in our country. `` I was surprised to hear about some of the things he knew about the movement,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> had said after a recent meeting with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He was tossing out names and places and asking a lot of questions.'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> was one of the few civil rights leaders to support the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's failed nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> as the nation's top civil rights enforcer. Others had charged that the black Republican lacked experience. The nomination was killed two weeks ago in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> subsequently appointed <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to another position in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that did n't require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The convention, which runs through Friday, is being held in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the first time since <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> took over the leadership in 1977. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> and the Revs. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuttlesworth </PERSON>, founded the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> in 1957 in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to carry on the movement started with bus boycotts in that city. It has long been considered the grass-roots arm of the movement, working on issues such as homelessness, unemployment and economic empowerment.

 Time has erased most of the scars left along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> beachfronts by Hurricane Camille, but for survivors the horrors of the 1969 killer are as vivid as yesterday. `` We live with the memory of <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON>. `` There's another Camille out there somewhere and I just pray it does n't come in here.'' The most powerful storm in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> danced along the coast for days before roaring ashore in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> the night of Aug. 17, 1969. <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>'s 200 mph winds smashed everything in its path and it unleashed a wall of water as high as 30 feet. Two hundred forty-eight people died, including 141 in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Structures that had withstood major hurricanes of the past, including <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> in 1965, vanished under <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>'s tidal wave. Large ships were tossed onto dry land, with a 200-foot barge coming to rest across what was left of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 90, at the time the major traffic artery along the coast. `` I flew down there the next morning and it was incredible,'' recalled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. G.V. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss. `` I had seen total destruction in battle zones in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but nothing like this.'' `` There were no cars, no people moving. It was very frightening,'' he said. In the weeks following <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, National Guardsmen patrolled streets to prevent looting. Volunteers from across the country arrived to help remove debris and provide food and shelter for hundreds of homeless. Losses from the storm, which also caused extensive damage along coastal <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and spawned scores of tornadoes inland, was placed at $ 1.5 billion, with most of the loss coming in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guice </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> destroyed 6,744 homes and damaged 46,709 more, while destroying or damaging 746 businesses. Harbor facilities have been rebuilt and the sand beach reclaimed over the years, but there are reminders _ driveways leading to empty lots, twisted, aging trees and even a souvenir shop built next to a shrimp boat that rests near where it was blown ashore. `` When a hurricane gets in the Gulf you see people looking out over the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Sound, wondering if another <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> is coming,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, harbor master at the <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> small craft harbor. `` Before that storm people always felt things would n't be as bad as the weather people were predicting Well, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> changed all that.'' The storm left another calling card for shrimpers along the coast as receding waters sucked debris back into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` There were lots of shrimp out here after <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> but you could n't drag but about 10 minutes before you would have to pull the nets in to clean out the referigerators, car batteries, pilings and things like that,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevel </PERSON>, who as a 16-year-old at the time worked with his father aboard their shrimp boat. `` We even had ` zippers' on our nets so they could be opened quickly to dump the debris.'' <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> and her husband had ridden out hurricanes for more than 50 years and saw no reason to abandon their beachfront home in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> despite the urging of friends and neighbors. Within a few hours, the two were clinging for life, 30 feet up a television antenna, watching as gulf waters crushed their home and covered the two-story house next door. `` How can one forget a night like that?'' asked Mrs. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, 79. `` Everything we had, things that can never be replaced, are gone forever.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> recalls the violent wind that pinned her head back for hours, the blinding flashes of lightning in a night with no stars or street lights, and the hours she hung onto her unconscious husband in a sea of debris. The two, suffering broken ribs and other injuries, were rescued the next morning. `` There are so many stories of horror from that storm,'' said <PERSON> Guice </PERSON>, who has headed <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s emergency agency for 28 years. `` There was the apartment complex where at least 24 people drowned during a hurricane party and an Episcopal Church built in 1849 where 13 members of one family died.'' `` I keep thinking about the loss of life, if only those people had responded to our evacuation call.''

<HEAD>Government Reports More Evidence of `Soft Landing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Industrial production rose for the first time in three months in July while housing starts continued to rebound, the government said Wednesday in reports seen as further evidence a recession will be avoided this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index last month stood at 141.7 percent of its 1977 base, compared with 141.4 percent in June. The 0.2 percent increase in July followed consecutive declines of 0.1 percent in May and June. Overall production was up 2.7 percent over a year ago. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing starts rose 0.8 percent in July after posting declines for four consecutive months through May. They started to rebound with an 8.5 percent increase in June. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported that the factory operating rate remained steady at 83.6 percent in July, continuing to ease inflationary pressures. `` It's consistent with the soft-landing scenario, modest growth without tipping into a recession,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said of the reports. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that several months of stagnant production at manufacturing plants had been causing fears of a recession. But Wednesday's report `` indicates that manufacturing may have bottomed out and we're seeing some moderate strength that should help with the soft-landing scenario,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been walking a fine line between keeping interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. It began letting rates drop in June as inflation seemed to lessen. `` The July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of total materials as well as continued strength in business equipment excluding motor vehicles,'' the central bank said Wednesday in releasing the industrial production report. `` In contrast, automobile and truck production fell sharply, and output of construction supplies, on balance, remained weak,'' it said. Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent after remaining flat in May and June. That was a 3.3 percent increase from July 1988. Output at mines and oil wells rose 0.3 percent following a revised 1.1 percent decline in June caused in part by a coal strike. The July output was 3.5 percent lower than a year ago. Production at utilities, reflecting increased use of air conditioning, rose 0.8 percent in July, following a 1.3 percent decline in June. Utility production was up 1.2 percent from July 1988. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>, manager of the Community Resources Section of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said he was encouraged by the housing report. `` This month's rebound in housing starts shows that the country's economic expansion is continuing,'' he said The July level of construction totaled 1.43 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 1.41 million in June. Single-family construction rose 6.3 percent last month while apartment starts fell 1.2 percent. Analysts said the multifamily drop was a natural falloff from an unusually steep 32.9 percent increase in June. The operating rate at the nation's factories remained at 83.6 percent last month after declining 0.3 percentage point in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported. The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last December. Last month's operating rate was down from 83.7 percent a year earlier. The closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of inflationary pressures. The operating rate at manufacturing plants slipped 0.1 percentage point to 83.9 percent, down from June's 84 percent. That rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, edged down 0.3 percentage point from 82.6 percent in June. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods rose to 86.2 percent, compared with 86.1 percent in June.

 The government accused communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Wednesday of using the border for propaganda purposes by allowing a student to return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> across the Demilitarized Zone after an illegal visit. Unification Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong-koo </PERSON> said, `` These provocative acts could endanger a truce on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula.'' Im Su-kyong, 20, was arrested when she crossed the border Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> peace village. She had gone to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> six weeks ago. Government officials said Miss Im was being questioned Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> at a hospital. She was taken there for a medical checkup because she recently went on a five-day hunger strike. Officials said she would be released from the hospital soon into the intelligence agency's custody. The agency has said it intends to arrest everyone who participated in sponsoring or financing the trip. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> forbids unauthorized trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and insists that all dialogue on reunification be conducted through official channels. The peninsula has been divided since 1945. Miss Im went to the North for an international youth festival as a symbol of reunification and has said she returned across the heavily guarded border to dramatize the issue. Her supporters call her `` the flower of unification.'' She crossed the border with the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyu-hyun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who traveled to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to escort her home. They were arrested immediately. The government has said they would be charged with violating security laws by making unauthorized trips to an enemy country and committing other acts against state. Dissidents and radical students said they would conduct a nationwide campaign against any punishment for Miss Im and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>. Newspapers and political columnists predicted the trip and its aftermath would accelerate the deterioration of relations and lead to another crackdown on dissent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the unification minister, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` committed an intentional provocation'' by permitting the crossing `` through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> despite our repeated warnings.'' The U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a signatory to the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the three-year Korean war, said a formal protest would be filed with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> say the crossing violated the agreement. No peace treaty has been signed, so the nations remain technically at war. Talks to reduce tensions have been held sporadically, with little progress.

 Participants in a government-sponsored conference on AIDS and minorities disrupted a morning session Wednesday to demand discussion about women's issues and other topics they said were getting short shrift. About two dozen people attending the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on HIV Infection and AIDS Among Racial and Ethnic Populations took over the stage during the main morning event and, when the speaker finished, commandeered the microphone. `` I'm not getting what I need out of this conference,'' <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told the audience of several hundred. `` I need information on drugs. I need information on other people's programs. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> and others complained that women's issues _ including low representation in drug-testing trials _ were n't being adequately addressed and that there was n't enough opportunity for people actually running programs in communities to share their experiences with each other. A man among the demonstrators said people like himself who have AIDS were being shortchanged by the lack of discussion about life-prolonging treatments that are becoming available and about access to clinical trials in which new therapies are being tested. `` I'm sorry we had to act up, and I'm sorry that some of you do n't like the fact that we're acting up, but some of us are fighting for our lives,'' he said. `` It's platitudes, empty rhetoric we're hearing,'' <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the Center for Women's Policy Studies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> explained after the demonstration that, with much support from the audience, disrupted the conference for about half an hour. During the interruption, a woman who had been translating into sign language for the deaf continued signing, and often the audience broke in with enthusiastic applause for the protesters, some of whom are members of the activist group <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, known as ACT UP. At first, some in the audience argued with the action of the demonstrators, with one person in the audience calling the protest `` an act of incredible disrespect'' because the demonstrators began mobilizing at the front of the room while a native American was speaking from the podium. But another person in the audience rose to say: `` I think what they're doing is encouraging. ... There are too many of us that have felt a lot of anger and it's about time someone did something.'' Another person in the audience drew hearty applause when she said: `` We are letting ourselves be divided _ that's not what we're here about We need to move on and work together.'' The moderator of the session agreed to give the protesters five minutes, which stretched to about 20 minutes, for individuals among them to state their concerns. The four-day conference, which ends Thursday, is being sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, defended the agenda for the conference. `` In putting together this conference, we worked with all groups involved in the fight against AIDS ... about what should be discussed,'' he said. `` The list of sessions covers the complete spectrum _ from legal and discrimination issues to drug abuse, helping people with AIDS, volunteerism _ the whole spectrum.''

 The second test flight of the $ 530 million B-2 stealth bomber was cut short today by a low oil-pressure reading, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> at 7:29 a.m. for a three - to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m. because of `` minor concerns'' with its indicators, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman 1st Lt. <PERSON> Anu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON> `` It was decided to land, which is a normal procedure during any type of flight. ... The crews were never in any danger,'' she said. `` We do n't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with it and will have to check it out.'' Nevertheless, `` we did achieve some of the things we set out to do, so we ca n't say it was n't a successful flight,'' she said. The black, batwing bomber, whose fate in being debated in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, flew with its landing gear retracted for the first time and also flew a little faster and higher than on its maiden flight in July, although the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> wo n't specify the speed and altitude, she said. Each of the B-2's four engines `` has an accessory drive. One out of the four drives indicated low oil pressure,'' <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON> said. Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarius </PERSON> said the accessory drives power the engine turbine startup unit and hydraulic systems, but there was no failure of the hydraulic system, which on many planes allows pilots to operate flaps and other control surfaces. The flight by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> test pilot <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> came after a day of delays blamed on wind and a long list of preflight checklist. During takeoff, the plane climbed gradually and looked steady as it flew with the wind at its tail. Aircraft usually take off from here heading west, into the wind. During the plane's July 17 maiden flight, <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> and Couch flew the B-2 nearly two hours at up to 10,000 feet. The tailless, 172-foot-long wing with bulges in the middle was described by Couch as a `` very nimble aircraft'' and `` a lot of fun'' to fly. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had planned to fly the plane again after dawn Tuesday, but the test was rescheduled. `` There was nothing wrong with the airplane,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisert </PERSON>, a B-2 deputy program director. `` We expected winds to come up and we wanted to make sure we could get in a full day of activity.'' The bomber, the most expensive warplane in history, was given a unique contour and built with radar-absorbing composite materials. It is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, with the conventional B-1, replace the aging B-52 bomber. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to put strict limitations on production of the plane, requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to come up with a cheaper program. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> made a modest cut of $ 300 million in the $ 4.7 billion President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking. The government has already invested about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule.

<TEXT>
 A trail of popcorn led authorities to four young vandals who broke into a school, trashed several rooms and tried to take the sting out of any future punishment by stealing the school's paddles. The boys splattered finger paint, tore up a bean bag chair and scattered its contents and poured bleach, vinegar and cooking oil on floors. They also spilled unpopped popcorn, and that was their undoing, Sheriff <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said a boy at <ORGANIZATION> Cactus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> inquired the day before the burglary last week if there would be paddling during the upcoming school year. `` He was told yes, there would be,'' the sheriff said. `` Part of the things that were missing were all of the paddles in the school.'' Authorities later found popcorn kernels around the home of the boy who had popped the corporal punishment question. `` Apparently the youngest one had gotten cooking oil all over him,'' the sheriff said. `` The popcorn had stuck to the youngest one's clothes.'' School officials had no estimate of the damage. The boys were turned over to their parents and the case was referred to juvenile authorities. Cactus is about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> remembers the approach of Hurricane Camille on Aug. 17, 1969, was little more than an excuse for a party at her <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> apartment complex. After all, she had ridden out hurricanes before and `` a hurricane party was a good time to drink and play cards under the hurricane lamps.'' But within hours the storm's screaming 200 mph winds and wall of water claimed her husband and the two dozen people who had gathered on the third floor of the apartment complex for the party <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> organized. There were many stories of personal tragedy in <LOCATION> Camille </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, who spent that night 20 years ago with her late husband clinging for life 30 feet up their television tower in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> as giant waves reduced their home to rubble. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> said long hours at work before the storm saved her life. `` I had worked the night before so we decided to take a nap in our second-floor apartment and join the party on the third floor later. Not going up to that party is why I'm alive today.'' Within hours, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>'s strengthening wind had blown out their apartment's windows and water from the nearby <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> had reached waist deep in their bedroom. `` We looked up at our ceiling and there were cracks in the walls, you knew the third floor was fixing to come down right on top of us,'' she said. `` We swam out of the window and I immediately got tangled up in telephone lines.'' <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> said once she had freed herself, she fought to swim away. `` It was during that time I heard my husband hollering, ` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>,' and then I did n't hear his voice any more. I knew he had drowned but the shock did n't register,'' she said. As she grabbed onto debris and fought to keep her head above water `` I looked back and I could see the apartment house. It just started sliding down into the water,'' she said. `` I will never forget seeing the hurricane lamps as they were still lit and disappearing under the water. I knew all those people inside were gone.'' <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> was rescued the next morning on a pile of debris. Her husband's body was found in a tree-top 11 days later. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> is now serving a life sentence for murdering a later husband. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, now 79, had experienced several hurricanes during her 51 years living along the coast. She rode out a major storm in 1947 and `` I just did n't believe <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> could be any worse than that one.'' Despite warnings from friends, the couple decided to stay to protect their home. Within a few hours it was too late to leave. Water eventually poured into their home and they were swept outside. They clung to their 60-foot television tower, inching higher as waves broke over their heads. `` All around it looked like we were in mid-ocean _ the wind was so strong I could n't hold my head up,'' <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> said. The tower finally broke off, sending the couple into the water and knocking her husband unconscious. She managed to pull him to the roof of their house, `` which was floating like a barge at the back of our property.'' Hours later, the two were rescued and both were hospitalized for broken ribs and other injuries. `` The first Sunday <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> was out of the hospital he went to his Sunday school class at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, and the class sang the hymn ` Lord Plant My Feet on Higher Ground' and dedicated it to him.''

 Californians want a bigger say in who becomes president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and strongly support advancing the date of the state's primary, a poll found. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Poll released Tuesday found that residents favor moving up the primary, now scheduled in June, unless the move costs a lot of money. Democrats and Republicans alike favor the proposal by 61 percent to 21 percent, according to the poll. But the estimated $ 40 million added expenses was a definite turn-off, with only 14 percent backing such a plan when the estimate was included. The last time <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters cast decisive votes in a presidential bid was in 1972, when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary to grab the Demoratic nomination. Measures have been introduced in the Legislature to move the primary to February, March or April. `` It would create at the top of the calendar an instant winnowing device for both parties and establish early on who are credible national candidates,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Those who dislike the current primary system say the state has virtually no voice in selection of presidential nominees, even though it sends the largest groups of delegates to party conventions. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Poll was based on interviews with 754 registered voters and was conducted by telephone from July 12 to July 23. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percent.

But that can not and it will not be as long as <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> violates the human rights of his own people; as long as he, almost alone in the entire world now, swims against the tide that is bringing sweeping change, democracy and freedom to closed societies around the world,'' he said. `` As president, I will look for signs that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> wants to move away from subverting his neighbors, move toward more openness, more freedom for his own people. But until I see demonstrable change there will be no improvement in relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared to warm applause. `` It simply can not be.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> severed relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1961. The two nations currently are represented in each other's capital by `` interest sections'' rather than full-fledged embassies. The president embarked on a three-week <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> vacation today by taking a roundabout route from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to boost <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s bid to succeed the late Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> district that includes many Cuban-Americans and other Hispanics The Cuban-born candidate's campaign manager is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> comes amid a bitter debate over <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> efforts to deport an anti-Castro Cuban militant, Dr. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence information implicates <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> in bombings and assassination attempts during <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s 30-year rule of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s supporters, including <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, view him as a hero in the battle against <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said she planned to ask the president to overrule the deportation order, and Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., has requested a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the matter White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, however, that the president could not address the case. `` It's a matter before the legal system and we ca n't comment on it,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> `` the kind of uncompromising, experienced crime-fighter we need in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> right now.'' And, in a district whose ethnic voting population is critical to campaign strategies, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> has `` an increased sensitivity to the problems of all oppressed minorities, wherever they may be.'' He recounted a story about her grandfather who helped smuggle Jewish refugees out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> `` wehn <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s tyranny crushed freedom on the island.'' The president was campaigning for the 37-year-old educator as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> eyed what it considers a golden opportunity to add to its 10-8 majority in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation. Pepper held the seat for the Democrats from its inception until his death 27 years later, May 30 at age 88. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> will face <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who won the Democratic nomination in a heated runoff Tuesday night, in the Aug. 29 election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to travel to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, later today to spend the next 20 days at his family compound by the sea. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff said the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> trip would be mostly recreational, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family and friends on hand. First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent most of the month there. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expecting visits from Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schluter </PERSON>. The athletic president has spent past trips to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> in a whirl of golf, tennis, jogging, swimming, boating, fishing and restaurant-hopping. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> race is one of several House special elections this year in which the Democrats and Republicans are sparring heatedly. Republicans hope to improve their standing of 175 members to 255 for the Democrats, with five vacancies. The most recent vacancies were created by the deaths of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. They died in separate plane crashes. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, whose resignation after seven years as a state legislator is effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with 83 percent of the vote. The Democratic runoff was charged with ethnic innuendo. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, a lawyer, said repeatedly that the seat is `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seat.'' His opponent was Cuban-born <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when she was 14.

 Juveniles held at the city's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> have been put in the same cellblock as adults, and in at least one case, in the same cell, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported today.

State and federal law allow juveniles who have been certified to stand trial as adults to be housed in an institution with adults. But the practice may violate a <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> consent decree requiring that juveniles at the House of Correction be kept separate from adults there, the newspaper said. The Inquirer said that according to prison records, one day last month, three adults were held in a part of the cellblock that prison officials said is for juveniles. The records also showed that an adult was housed in the same cell as a juvenile who had been at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> for one day. That adult had been charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of children. Prison officials said as many as 27 juveniles at a time have been held in a wing of the adult prison over the past nine months because of overcrowding at the city's youth detention center.

<HEAD>Hard Liquor Sales at Lowest Point Since Record-Keeping Began</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RECASTS throughout to show that shipments not at 18-year low,

<TEXT>
 Shipments of hard liquor fell last year to the lowest point since an industry survey began in 1970, a development attributed to Americans' new love of health and fear of addiction. With only a few individual ups among the downs, sales of distilled goods fell 4.2 percent last year, to 159 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1987, the trade publication Impact reports in its current edition. Liquor sales last year were 2.5 percent below the 163 million cases shipped in 1970, the first year Impact began its industrywide survey. A case equals nine liters. Industry experts have blamed a variety of factors: growing health consciousness, the aging of the baby boom generation and the powerful campaigns in recent years against drunken driving and intoxication by alcohol and drugs. In the late 1970s, some in the industry hoped hard liquor sales would rise as the baby boom generation grew out of beer and wine. Instead, distaste for drinking appears to be drying up sales of all alcoholic beverages. Total wine consumption in this country dropped to 552.2 million gallons in 1988, down 28.7 million gallons, or 4.9 percent, from the previous year, the industry publication <ORGANIZATION> Wines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Vines reported last month. Beer sales, too, were flat, registering a negligible rise to 2.4 million cases in 1988. Impact blamed the decline in sales of distilled goods on `` the cumulative effects of federal, state and local tax increases on spirits and the continuing pressure on the entire alcoholic beverage industry from anti-alcohol forces.'' Studies indicate consumers drink less as they age, Impact said. Distillers, their profits drained by declining sales, cut total advertising budgets last year by more than $ 100 million, to $ 240 million, Impact said. Makers of so-called `` white goods'' _ vodka, gin, rum and tequila _ could toast some sales gains. Vodka, at 38 million cases distributed last year, was reported the biggest-selling distilled spirit in the country, far ahead of the 21 million cases sold in 1970. Gin ran a poor second in 1988 with 14 million cases. Rum, with 13 million cases in 1988, advanced 7 million cases over 1970. Whiskeys took the biggest whipping, a challenge distillers regard as extremely grim as they look for ways to recruit new customers to replace aging whiskey sippers. It's estimated people over 50 years old account for half the sales of whiskeys, called `` brown goods'' in the trade. Sales in the whiskey segment, including bourbon, blends, Scotch, Canadian and Irish, declined 43 million cases, to 60 million cases, between 1970 and 1988. <PERSON> Bourbon </PERSON> was the biggest loser, dipping 19 million cases from the 36 million figure in 1970 and skidding 6.3 percent between 1987 and 1988 alone. The biggest loser from 1987 to 1988 was Scotch, dipping by 8.8 percent to 13 million cases. But even as they spurn hard liquor, drinkers demonstrate there's still commercial value in the snob appeal of a beverage like single-malt Scotch The leading single-malt Scotches, Glenlivet and Glenfiddich, advanced by 130,000 and 75,000 cases, respectively, between 1987 and 1988.

 In an ethnically tense battle to succeed the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, a lawyer won the Democratic nomination on the theme that he's running for `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seat.'' His Cuban-born Republican opponent called his victory ominous. The winner was <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, a 47-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president making his first run for office. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> gathered much of his strength from a heavy majority of the diverse district's white non-Hispanic voters in a 61-39 percent victory over <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> moves on to an Aug. 29 special election against state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, Cuban-born as is Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, for the seat left vacant by Pepper's death May 30 at age 88. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> got a strong endorsement today from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who hastily arranged a side trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> before beginning a vacation in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON>'s dream is your dream,'' he told some 600 people at a fund-raising luncheon. `` It's not a Republican dream or a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dream _ it's the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s legislative experience and her tough stand on crime and drugs. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> called his victory a victory for the community. `` Now is the time for Democratic unity. ... I can not understand how being an American can possibly be divisive.'' He said he will represent `` all the people,'' not any one ethnic group. With all of 146 precincts reporting unofficial returns, <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> had 14,411 votes to 9,226 votes for Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, a seven-year state legislator, flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday and flew back to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> late this morning aboard Air Force One with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed a list of speakers at the luncheon. Organizers said they raised at least $ 250,000 for <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s campaign. `` I think the victory sends an ominous message that there are some voters who respond to an ethnically divisive campaign,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said. Republicans believe they have a strong shot at adding to their 10-8 majority in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation by winning the seat Pepper held for Democrats since its inception 27 years ago. Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 44, in her concession speech, called on <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> `` to stop this divisive campaign'' and warned that an ethnic campaign `` can have <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s seat in jeopardy.'' She said she would meet with <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> today to discuss the general election campaign. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said, though, that he can defeat Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> on issues such as abortion _ she's anti-abortion, he's for abortion rights _ and that he can unify the community. `` She is in the right-wing, extreme element of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. `` We're going to campaign by going to the people. This is a grass-roots campaign,'' said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who overcame Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s support by party leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said his theme was meant to unify <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and to rebut <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> national Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s statement that it's time to elect the first Cuban-American to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` He thinks that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is his opponent,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said. `` I condemned those words the moment they were uttered.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 37, said she will campaign on issues such as crime and drugs and holding down taxes. `` I think voters are going to choose on issues and experience,'' she said. `` I'm certainly proud of my heritage, but I do n't campaign on that basis.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> carried Hispanic and black precincts Tuesday, but was defeated 4-to-1 in predominantly `` Anglo,'' or non-Latin white, precincts. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, Jewish and Brooklyn-born, stunned Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, with a late-charging, 146-vote victory in the Aug. 1 primary, in which five other Democrats were eliminated. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, whose resignation as state legislator is effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with 83 percent of the vote. Her campaign manager is <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son. Little difference on issues emerged between Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> in their runoff, dominated by discussion of ethnic divisiveness, qualifications and ability to defeat Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>. Democrats are concerned that an increasing number of Hispanic voters _ they now make up 40 to 50 percent of those registered _ will swing future elections to Republicans. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> supporters said he can best energize the vote in black neighborhoods and on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to capitalize on the Democrats' continued registration advantage

 The jury in the 6-month-old `` Night Stalker'' murder trial resumed deliberations today after the foreman reported that panel had `` put behind them'' the slaying of a juror and the suicide of her boyfriend. The `` Night Stalker'' defendant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a drifter charged with 13 murders, shouted out an objection and an obscenity when the judge indicated he would allow the panel to return to its task with an alternate member.

There was no request for mistrial.

<TEXT>
 Authorities gave permission Wednesday for a tent community to shelter hundreds of East Germans seeking to emigrate to the West, while the international dispute surrounding them escalated. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told a West German official that activities by <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> violate international law. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said the East German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called in <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertele </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Permanent Representation, to lodge the protest. <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said it was rejected by <PERSON> Bertele </PERSON>. The tents approved by Hungarian authorities are intended for use by some of the hundreds of East Germans who left their makeshift camp outside the West German consulate Tuesday and moved to a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. A crush of passport and asylum requests by East Germans has overwhelmed West German diplomats in this city and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The embassy and consulate were closed in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> Monday, and the West German mission shut down in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Aug. 8. <PERSON> Csilla </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeselager </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maltese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> humanitarian group, said about 20 military tents would be set up Thursday on a campground in a working-class district in the Pest part of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. The tents, sent with cots by the West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, can shelter up to 350 people, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Some East Germans began round-the-clock vigils outside the consulate last month in hopes of getting help to emigrate to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most have now illegally overstayed their visas to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government officials said Monday that 141 adults and 40 children remained holed up inside the West German Embassy despite the closure to the public. They have demanded asylum in the compound. Hundreds more East Germans are reported to have gone underground rather than return to their Communist homeland. Some refugees say they fear persecution if they go home, and others say they seek a better life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are allies in the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Hungarian officials have privately acknowledged that East German attempts to use <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as a springboard to the West are leading to tensions between their country and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officially, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> insists the affair is strictly between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. But a West German diplomat said Wednesday the Hungarians are doing what they can to help the East Germans' efforts to emigrate. `` The tent city OK comes officially from the mayor of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, but it's clear that the -LRB- Hungarian -RRB- interior and foreign ministries were consulted,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The estimated 300 East Germans who left the consulate crowded the lawns of a Roman Catholic church Tuesday evening, but Mrs. <PERSON> Boeselager </PERSON> said Hungarian families took in two thirds of them Wednesday. On Wednesday, many of those remaining at the church lined up at folding wooden tables as <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers doled out peas and pork. Some refugees ate sitting on the lawn, while others filled out questionnaires given them by West German diplomats. The refugees say the diplomats have been processing requests and handing out passports on church grounds. Several East Germans say they will stay in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as long as it takes to gain passage to the West. `` People at home are so bitter about the stagnation there,'' said a 30-year old woman while her two boys, aged 6 and 3, crouched at her feet eating their food. `` We'll do anything to make it over the border.'' The wave of refugees developed in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after its liberal communist authorities removed border fences with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May. Hungarian border guards, however, have not let East Germans pass with papers obtained in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>.

 Another bump is in the path of <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager already under fire over allegations he gambled on baseball.

It was the second time in 13 months that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> has bumped an umpire. The argument Tuesday night came during the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>' 5-2 loss to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>. It started over a call by the plate umpire.

<HEAD>Utility Chief Says Nuclear Managers Ignored Warning of Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Managers of a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> nuclear plant that has been called one of the nation's worst ignored warnings as long ago as three years that complacency was jeopardizing safety, the owner's chief executive told federal regulators Wednesday <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he had told supervisors at the Calvert Cliffs plant on <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> that he saw `` a slippage setting in'' that threatened the plant's reputation for efficiency and safety `` I'm not so sure they believed what I had to say,'' <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which last December declared Calvert Cliffs one of the worst-run plants in the country and stepped up monitoring of its operations. The commissioners called in <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> and the utility's other top officers to explain how Calvert Cliffs had fallen to the bottom of the performance pile after long being touted as one of the best-run and most efficient plants in the nation. The plant's sudden fall from grace has raised new questions about the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to detect drops in plant performance levels before serious accidents occur. Both of Calvert Cliffs' nuclear reactors were shut down last May because of mechanical problems. A series of earlier mishaps at the plant culminated in the accidental death last September of an employee who drowned in a water storage tank. `` We recognize we have problems _ major problems,'' <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> told the commissioners. `` The current state of affairs disturbs me deeply.'' He and other utility officials said they were working on a broad strategy for improving operations, including methods of ensuring stricter adherence to safety procedures and strengthening plant management.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has made clear it does not want to intervene in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but is quietly reminding the Syrians of limits to how far they can expand their battle with the Christians without risking retaliation. The warnings have been contained in hints by some officials and repeated public statements calling for worldwide pressure on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to stop the 5-month-old battle <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, a legislator from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said Tuesday the Israelis would warn <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` in a quiet way'' about `` red Lines'' that can not be crossed That same day, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force sent a warning to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, some of whom are allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, by buzzing guerrilla positions near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Reporters asked <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Wednesday whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would put limits on Syrian military action in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He replied without elaboration: `` There are red lines. The red line is the safety of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has long made clear that its strongest territorial defense line is drawn at <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Awali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The river is 25 miles north of the border. The government also insists the Syrians not threaten <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>'s freedom to fly reconnaissance over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or its ability to patrol the southern Lebanese coast to block guerrilla attacks by sea Most statements by officials have castigated the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for failing to stop or condemn <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s bombardment of civilians in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also shelled relentlessly during a 70-day siege in 1982. `` We were sorry to see that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was not ready to do anything of any significance,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. `` The Syrians think they can act in this brutal manner contrary to all the norms and laws of civilized society.'' At a meeting called by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved an appeal Tuesday night for a cease-fire in the Syrian-Christian artillery battle that began five months ago. Analysts say they believe <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> understands how far it can go, but also pointed to changes in strategy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would consider a threat. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> expert at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> ground buildup could be dangerous for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> even if it did not encroach on south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` If they bring large formations, air defense systems are part of these formations,'' he said, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would fear that <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> missiles could interfere with its aerial surveillance. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> now has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, a retired brigadier general and independent military analyst, said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> air defense batteries could `` gnaw away'' at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s freedom of action in the air. He also said a Syrian victory in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that upset the balance of power might force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to reconsider its non-intervention policy. `` If <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> ends up with the upper hand, being victorious, this will be a drastic change in the strategic situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> added, however, that he did not believe President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would risk possible retaliation from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which supplies arms to the Christians. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> does not want to `` annihilate'' the Christians, he said, only to punish the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, for challenging his role as power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> describes the Syrians as an occupation army and says he is fighting a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. `` What <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> really wants is <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s head,'' <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said. He said involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has kept <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> too busy to concentrate on Israeli, and `` it's a blessing for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will be bogged down deeper and deeper in the Lebanese mud.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unwillingness to intervene stems from its experiences in the 1982-85 invasion and occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: 650 soldiers killed, political disunity at home and harm to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image abroad. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said on television Wednesday: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not get out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in order to return there. ... There is a place for being worried only if direct Israeli interests are harmed.''

<HEAD>What's Life Without a Yellow Legal Pad, Lawyers Are Wondering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The capital's army of high-priced lawyers _ at least those not spending August playing golf somewhere _ was jolted by an edict from local government trash collectors this week: `` Stop using yellow legal pads.'' The warning was intended to prepare local office workers for a sweeping new recycling law that goes into effect in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Oct. 1, and to discourage them from producing colored paper trash which many recycling firms do n't want. Although yellow legal pads are n't actually banned by the new law, the order from <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohlfs </PERSON>, recycling coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>, sent a chill through this town with the highest concentration of lawyers anywhere in the country _ more than 30,000 of them, or roughly one for every 22 residents. Does this portend the demise of the legal brief? Will there be fewer petitions to habeas the corpus? Will those friends of the court _ the amicus curiae _ be popping in less frequently to lend a helpful hand? `` It means we'll have to use white legal pads, I guess,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a partner in the prestigious, 240-lawyer firm of <ORGANIZATION> Covington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Burling. Yellow legal pads are suffering a decline in popularity among younger lawyers who prefer to use personal computers for their legal research and note-keeping, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` But us older fellows and gals are wedded to yellow legal pads, I'm afraid,'' he said. `` My desk is littered with them right now.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothkopf </PERSON>, partner and chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Hogan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hartson </PERSON>, said the new law will mean headaches for landlords, who must haul the trash away, but not for lawyers. `` We'll do things the way we always have,'' <PERSON> Rothkopf </PERSON> said. `` There'll always be yellow pads. We lawyers ca n't live without them.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, predicted that his colleagues will figure a way to `` pick at the law'' and get around it somehow, possibly by using legal pads with a slightly different color, `` such as beige, or maybe mauve.'' `` Lawyers charge by the pound for paper, whether it's separated in piles for recycling or not,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. `` They'll still figure out a way to make the law work for them.'' The law, signed by Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> in January, is intended to help the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> recycle more of the 720,000 tons of trash it generates annually. Most of the city's solid wastes are burned in an incinerator or buried in a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> sanitary landfill that is expected to reach capacity in three years. <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, who sponsored the new law, called <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` a paper factory'' whose paper trash amounts to 53 percent of the city's solid wastes, compared with a national average of about 36 percent. Effective Oct. 1, according to Ms. <PERSON> Rohlfs </PERSON>, all paper trash _ newspapers, magazines, computer paper and office stationery _ must be collected separately for recycling. `` Keep the newspapers separate,'' she said. `` Keep the computer paper separate. Keep out contaminants such as gum labels, tape and see-through envelopes. And stop using yellow legal pads.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Roslyn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazer </PERSON> said crackdown on yellow legal pads might lead to a bright future for some of her colleagues. `` Many lawyers are frustrated gourmet ice cream salesmen, baseball executives or proctologists,'' she said. `` The unavailability of the yellow legal pad will enable them to embark on fully satisfying careers.''

<HEAD>Governing Party's Youth Wing Protests Any U.S. Bases in Singapore</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing party's youth wing on Wednesday protested <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s proposal to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases on its territory. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s offer, made earlier this month, was seen as a move to encourage the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to extend the lease on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases there. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> asked other countries in the region to share some of the burden of having <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. Five officials of the youth wing of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> gave their note to the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> diplomats at that country's embassy. However, the youth officials and about 20 supporters made no move to protest at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy across the street. The note accused <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> of ignoring the concerns of its neighbors. `` We know it is <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s sovereign right to do as she wants, but how will she like it if <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> invites the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to site bases in this country?'' Some members of the group said they ignored the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> because the proposal came from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has not said it would accept it. Malaysian leaders, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON>, also have criticized <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> for making the proposal. If accepted, they said, it could destabilize the region. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> diplomats declined comment on the youth group's criticism, saying only that the note would be sent to their government The tensions stem from the opposition of many Filipinos, including lawmakers, to extend the lease of the six American installations there. They include the stategically important <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is touring the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s offer was helpful and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was also eager to keep its bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He said, however, if Philippine opponents of the bases win their battle to block leasing of the bases beyond 1991, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will find other host countries for them. `` If they come to the conclusion that it is to the best interest of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to permit us to continue using the facilities, then we will gladly and willingly continue to utilize them,'' he said. He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would develop `` operative facilities elsewhere'' in case the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> decides to close the bases. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, chairman of the Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs subcommittee, arrived in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Wednesday with Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., and <ORGANIZATION> Eni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faleomavaega </ORGANIZATION>, a legislator from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> He met briefly with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> but did not say what was discussed.

<HEAD>Revolutionary Hard-liner New Iranian Parliament Speaker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Iranian lawmakers Wednesday elected to the influential post of parliament speaker a radical anti-Western cleric who advocates the spread of the Islamic revolution. The selection of <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> was seen as a blow to the new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, whose so-called pragmatist faction favors rebuilding relations with the West. Parliament has to approve all the president's Cabinet appointments. As the overseer of the 270-seat parliament, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> could make or break legislation and curb <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s policies. State-run <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> won 145 votes among the 243 members of the parliament, called the Majlis, who attended the session Wednesday. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 54, had been speaker since 1980 but gave up the post after his election to the presidency July 28. He had pushed for former Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nateq-Nouri </PERSON> to succeed him. During his time as speaker, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> built the speakership into a key role. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, a 51-year-old middle-ranking cleric, has been a member of the Majlis since March 1981 and was elected deputy speaker under <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> last year. He is a revolutionary hard-liner who frequently was imprisoned for his clandestine activities during the reign of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. He is allied with <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s political rivals, led by the radical interior minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> also was close to the late revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who named him head of the <ORGANIZATION> Martyrs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a vast conglomerate that controls more than 700 enterprises in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> As head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> was well-placed to oversee covert operations in the drive to export the Islamic revolution. In 1986, Iranian Revolutionary Guards posing as pilgrims tried to smuggle explosives and weapons into <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> during the annual pilgrimage to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrines in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. Most were arrested and deported. The following year, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> led militant Iranian pilgrims to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, where Saudi troops were called in to quell political rioting allegedly instigated by the Iranians. More than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians, were killed. This year, <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> told demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> the 1987 riots were `` a calculated plot designed by American and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> advisers to prevent the spread of the Islamic revoution to other parts of the world.'' <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, was involved with <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> in secret arms-for-hostages negotiations in 1985 with then-U.S. National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is expected to take the oath of office Thursday. He takes over the presidency from <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who was elected <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious leader after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died June 3.

<TEXT>
 The pilot of a plane carrying Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> appeared nervous and even ran the aircraft off a taxiway shortly before takeoff, officials investigating the fatal crash said Wednesday. The Cessna 177 veered east from its anticipated flight path before slamming into a 70-foot pine tree in the DeSoto National Forest Sunday night. Killed were pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON>, 58, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 45-year-old freshman Republican. People who saw <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON> before takeoff `` said he appeared to be kind of nervous ... like he was concerned about the flight,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON>, regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` People at the <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION> airport observed the aircraft taxing out and said it ran off the paved -LRB- taxiway -RRB- area and into the grass, then back onto the paved area, which is kind of strange,'' <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The two were returning from <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION> to their homes in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, about 70 miles to the south. The plane wreckage was found Monday, scattered through tall pines and dense underbrush about 14 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowden </PERSON>, an employee of Southeast Aviation, watched <PERSON> Vierling </PERSON>'s single-engine plane both during and after takeoff. `` He taxied straight out off the ramp area onto the grass and when he realized what had happened, he made a 180-degree turn, then taxied slowly out to the runway,'' <PERSON> Dowden </PERSON> said. `` The taxiways are lit up with blue lights and what happened struck us as being highly unusual.'' <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said there were other questions about the first minutes of the flight, including why the pilot told controllers that he would follow the established route along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 49 but instead flew about nine miles to the east over the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will look at every aspect to see why he deviated,'' <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said. While the investigation into the crash continues, residents of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> once served as sheriff, began filing by the congressman's flag-draped casket on Wednesday. A funeral Mass was scheduled for Thursday.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court agreed Wednesday to hear the appeals of three white men convicted in the 1986 <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> attack, in which a black man fleeing a white gang was hit by a car and killed. State Court of Appeals Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON>, on behalf of the full seven-member court, granted the appeals of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, both 20, and <PERSON> Ladone </PERSON>, 18, were convicted in December 1987 of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault for attacking three black men in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> on Dec. 20, 1986.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader on Wednesday marked the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II by reminding his countrymen of the `` heavy burden'' of their Nazi past. Bishop <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON>, chairman of the West German bishops conference, also called the Nazi massacre of the Jews `` unparalleled'' in human history. On Sept. 1, 1939, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops attacked <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, touching off the worldwide conflict that killed more than 50 million people. During their 12-year dictatorship, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> also killed an estimated 6 million Jews. In his message, <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> said later generations are not responsible for what happened under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that alone does n't take care of the question of guilt and its causes,'' he wrote. `` All in fact are affected by the common heritage and must carry along this heavy burden in solidarity.'' `` And what's more, all are responsible for what will become of our people in the future,'' the 53-year-old bishop wrote in his message distributed to the news media. He blamed the outbreak of the war on the Nazi leaders' `` megalomania,'' third thirst for power, and their `` criminal contempt of mankind. The bishop also called on West Germans to be on guard against movements that lead to hatred. The country has been seeing increasing support for the extreme right, which has blamed foreigners for many of the nation's troubles. <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> also singled out the sufferings of the Jews under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s profound hatred of Jewish fellow human beings and of certain minorities determined his actions,'' the bishop said. `` The genocide of the Jews is unparalleled in human history.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been the scene of a debate sparked by some conservative historians who argue that the Nazi killings of the Jews should be compared to other atrocities in history. Some West Germans contend those historians are trying to diminish the horror of the Holocaust.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane carrying forensic experts, medical equipment and nine coffins arrived Wednesday to retrieve the bodies of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and eight other Americans killed in a plane crash. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> said it probably would take five to seven days to identify the remains. The task was under way in a makeshift clinic at <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>'s international airport. `` Obviously, we would n't want to ship an Ethiopian body back to the states by mistake,'' said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, explaining the need for the medical specialists and their sophisticated equipment. `` Conversely, we would n't want to leave an American here.'' Seven Ethiopians also died in the crash Aug. 7 of the small Twin Otter plane, which was en route to a refugee camp near the Sudanese border. The plane slammed into the side of a mountain in bad weather, killing all aboard. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was visiting <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in his official capacity as head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger. As the medical experts arrived, other American military personnel began leaving. On Sunday, when the wreckage of the plane was found, more than 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel were in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> taking part in the search. Not since 1974, when a military coup brought a Marxist government to power in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, have so many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel been in the country. The Ethiopians even permitted an American U-2 reconnaissance plane, commonly used on spy missions, to participate in the search. That cooperation extended into an investigation into the cause of the crash, being conducted jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian experts. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and its Canadian counterpart and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> companies flew to the crash site Wednesday to begin the investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> provided the aircraft's frame and the engines for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s chartered Twin Otter, which was manufactured in a Canadian plant.

 After seven years of silence, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on Wednesday began talks aimed at normalizing diplomatic and trade relations that were severed after the 1982 Falklands War. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON>, met <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> del Solar, director-general of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, to `` seek to establish the conditions and agenda for direct talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' according to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission The mission said the meetings `` will be without prejudice to the sovereignty positions of either side regarding the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>.'' The talks opened Wednesday but no details on the times and locations were disclosed. An official communique is expected after they conclude Thursday. Although the dialogue is not taking place under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, `` it is an encouraging development that Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> welcomes,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, made the dialogue possible when he dropped his country's insistence that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s claim to the islands it calls the Malvinas be the first step in any talks A meeting between British and Argentine government officials in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in July 1984 broke down when <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> raised the sovereignty issue as a precondition. In April 1982, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded the islands, where 2,000 people of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> descent live. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> counterattacked and defeated <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in a six-week war that cost nearly 1,000 lives. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> cut ties with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and has said it will never negotiate sovereignty of the islands, where the population has expressed almost unanimous preference for continuing their colonial relationship with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have held indirect talks through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on such issues as fish conservation. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s government would like to recover fishing rights in the area around the Falklands. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> currently enforces a 150-mile exclusion zone, steering Argentine vessels away from the area. Many nations fish in the areas just outside the exclusion zone, largely unregulated, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> would like to reach an accord on regulating fishing in the south <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Both countries have lifted bans on importing each others' products, with <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> taking the step this month <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> lifted its ban in 1985.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s defense minister on Wednesday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of organizing a major guerrilla offensive to overthrow <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. Defense Minister <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON>, in an unusual interview with Western reporters, also said fighting in the 11-year-old civil war had died down across most of the country in recent months despite what he described as `` newer, heavier, and more sophisticated'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms provided to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON> also said the Moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> were feuding among themselves and could never be united under a single command. Asked about reports of a new guerrilla offensive, he said: `` On the basis of information acquired from different sources, the Americans, Pakistanis and Saudis are making strenuous efforts to amass a huge force from among all opposition groups to launch a major offensive with the hope of a military victory.'' He did not say when he expected it to begin or provide any other details, however. `` I'm also of the opinion that the problems of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> should be settled through peaceful means, and there is no possibility of the military solution of the problem,'' <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON> said. He added that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was ready to stop supplying weapons to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> halted arms shipments to the guerrillas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have accused each other of escalating the arms race in this poverty-stricken nation of 10 million people. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says the Soviets have nearly doubled their weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since they pulled their last troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February. It says the Soviets are providing up to $ 3 billion in weapons annually. Last week, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said the Soviets had begun to supplying MiG-29 fighters and the latest Sukhoi-27 ground-attack jets. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has promised the guerrillas new weapons to attack airport runways and counter high-altitude bombing attacks by the Afghan air force. Despite the reported arms shipments, <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON> said there had been an overall reduction in fighting by the guerrillas, except in provinces bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The seven most powerful guerrilla groups are based there. <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON> also said that since the Soviet pullout, leaders of the Pakistani-based guerrillas, who formed an interim government-in-exile, have lost much of their control over guerrilla field commanders. He said they were becoming increasingly isolated because of their growing identification with foreign powers. `` I am of the opinion opposition groups can never have a regular organization, and they can never be used under a single command. This is the result of the shattering blows of the armed forces ... which led to severe differences among them,'' he said. Though reputed to be a hard-liner, the general said he supported <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s policy of bringing all warring factions into a broad-based coalition and creating a neutral, demilitarized <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said the Afghan government has confounded Western predictions it would fall quickly without Soviet troops. `` The armed forces ... proved in the last six months that they can independently and alone eliminate the opposition groups inside the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Communist Party Seeks to Restore Moral Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist Party is appealing to the patriotism of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people as it tries to re-establish its moral influence in the wake of the June crackdown on dissent. Official newspapers Wednesday reprinted a 1956 article by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> that focused on the party's efforts to adapt socialism to fit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s needs, and its duty to set a moral example for the public. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, responding to questions raised by a youth group, said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members were `` advanced elements among the common people'' who can lead <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> down the `` happy road to socialism.'' The renewed call for party members to `` serve the people wholeheartedly'' is part of the party's effort to regain public confidence following massive pro-democracy protests this year. Party hardliners, who ordered the army to crush the student-led protests on June 3-4, are blaming the demonstrations and violence on ousted party leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and a small group of dissidents it accuses of promoting `` anti-Chinese,'' or unpatriotic, ideas. There are no signs yet of the xenophobia of the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, when even tenuous contacts with the outside world drew severe political persecution. After a decade of openness, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders appear unwilling to jeopardize foreign trade and international aid. They make only vague attacks on Western democratic ideas. But those attacks portray the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's defenders against a conspiracy to replace its customs and traditions with Western culture and socialism with capitalism `` Today, restoration of capitalism in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can only turn the socialist country into a dependency of the West. The Chinese nation, except for the traitors, will never agree to this,'' the People's Daily said Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> on Wednesday accused `` some foreign powers'' of contributing to the pro-democracy movement and of stirring up a `` wave of anti-Chinese feeling.'' The party has justified its arrests of many Chinese dissidents by charging that they opposed communism and rejected Chinese culture. Dissidents such as astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who is in hiding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, `` looked down on -LRB- <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s -RRB- ancient land and our yellow-skinned countrymen to such an extent that they even dreamed of extinguishing the Chinese race,'' the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said. The official commentaries blame <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who is believed to be under house arrest, for corruption and have repeatedly criticized him for supporting a controversial TV series broadcast last year, `` River Elegy,'' that questions the superiority of traditional Chinese culture. `` River Elegy taunted and condemned the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the Great Wall ... -LRB- and -RRB- went on to use yellow water, yellow soil, yellow beans, yellow rice and yellow skin as signs of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s backward and hopeless civilization,'' the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said The People's Daily, the official party newspaper, said the series `` repudiates the achievements made by socialist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ... While eulogizing and beautifying Western or capitalist civilization.'' An author of the series, <LOCATION> Su </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Xiaokang </LOCATION>, is blamed in some accounts for inciting the pro-democracy protests with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s support. But Su, who was arrested in June, said `` River Elegy'' was intended to encourage `` enlightenment and help the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people find a way out for their country.'' The party's efforts to meld partriotism and party influence is aimed at recapturing the influence lost by the pro-democracy protests and the resulting crackdown, in which hundreds were believed to have died. The protesters' complaints of official corruption touched a sensitive chord among the general public and posed a clear challenge to the party's moral leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to cheer the protesters and to voice their own grievances. Chinese say privately that few people are cooperating with party officials sent to work units to investigate supporters of the protests.

 Israeli authorities are depriving the 700,000 Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> of adequate medical care as an additional means of battling the Arab uprising, a group of doctors alleged Wednesday. The Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> doctors, who wrote a report on medical conditions in the occupied lands, said at a news conference that indifference by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities and political obstacles also have led to poor medical care in the territories. The only psychiatric ward for Gazans has no one trained in psychiatry, and the only oncology department is run by a blood specialist rather than a cancer expert, the doctors said in a report. The group _ the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> _ said that since the outbreak of the uprising, `` a new tendency has appeared: the use of medicine as an additional means of repression against the population.'' The military government's chief medical officer in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> denied the charges. `` We do n't mix medicine and politics,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterburg </PERSON>. He added that `` this physicians' association is known for its imprecision and slanting of facts.'' The doctors conceded that since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, medical treatment for Gazans has vastly improved. For example, infant mortality has dropped from 86 deaths per 1,000 babies to 28 deaths between 1970 and 1988. But they said the improvements came mainly because Israeli hospitals were available to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents. They said facilities in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> have been ignored. The doctors said the need for medical care has risen steeply because of the 20-month-old uprising, which has killed 536 Palestinians and wounded thousands in clashes with the army and Jewish settlers. The inadequacy of medical services has created a situation where Gazans `` are completely dependent on the decisions of the military government,'' the doctors said. It cited a severe shortage of doctors _ one per 1,400 residents in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> compared with one per 400 residents in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It also claimed that Israeli policies prevent dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors from working. No services exist in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> for chest or blood vessel surgery, neurosurgery, radiation treatment, pathology or handicapped rehabilitation, the report said. It charged that during army-imposed curfews, people who need medical care often could not get to clinics or hospitals. It also said army troops had thrown tear gas inside hospitals and entered some facilities to beat patients and medical staff. <PERSON> Peterburg </PERSON> said soldiers were under strict orders not to interfere with hospitals but could enter to make arrests. He said soldiers caught in beating incidents were punished. While acknowledging that health services in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> were not on a par with those of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said: `` If you look at the area over a period of years and remember where we started, the figures show that there has been constant improvement, even during the uprising.''

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership on Wednesday rejected as unconstitutional a new Estonian law that denies some Russian residents of the <LOCATION> Balitic </LOCATION> republic the right to vote. They called it a violation of human rights. However, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, has apparently sought to avoid a contest of wills with Estonian leaders over the law, which has touched off an 8-day-old protest strike by tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who live in the tiny Baltic republic. Instead, the Presidium said that by Oct. 1, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s government would present the republic's legislature with proposals to bring the law into line with the Soviet Constitution, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. That seemed to indicate agreement on both sides to avert a crisis. Leaders in the republic of 1.6 million people, which declared its sovereignty in November, have rejected attempts by Moscow-based authorities to annul their laws, but both sides have avoided bringing matters to a head. Estonian President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON> met with the Presidium in the Kremlin Wednesday and explained the reasons that led to adoption of the election law, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It was not clear whether he agreed it should be revised. Ethnic Estonians have called the more-restrictive law a necessity to ensure they maintain political control in their ethnic homeland and are not overwhelmed by an influx of ethnic Russians and Soviet outsiders lured by <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s higher living standards. But the Presidium found that the law's restrictions, which Justice Minister <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said constitute the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first residency requirements for voting and holding office, `` violate human rights.. including in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said The law limits the right to vote and hold office to long-term residents. Among diplomatic commitments entered into by the Soviets that are violated by the law is a Covenent guarantee that `` each citizen should have the right and possibility to vote without any discrimination and without groundless restrictions,'' the Presidium said. `` The Soviet Constitution, its demands of equality of rights of citizens and equality of citizens before the law, must be observed unconditionally _ there is no other way,'' said Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege, who chaired the meeting. Excerpts of the session were shown by state television. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Presidium's chairman, did not take part, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said he signed the decree at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, giving it his personal stamp of approval. The Soviet leader has been rumored to be on his customary August vacation. The Aug. 8 decision of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet parliament to limit the right of suffrage and office-holding ignited a strike that continued Wednesday. Strike committee member <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Maximov </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, that more than 20,000 workers have walked off the job, shutting down 51 factories and enterprises. Official Soviet media have said the strike in one of the country's most economically advanced republics has cost the national economy millions of rubles. More than 2,000 loaded freight cars are sitting idle and dock workers at <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s two ports also have joined the walkout, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the Estonian government had annulled its own Aug. 10 decree that had ordered an immediate end to the strike, but which stiffened strikers' resistance instead Protest leaders said the decision, which they called an attempt to appease them, would have no effect. `` Our demands are political, not economic,'' said <PERSON> Maximov </PERSON>. `` We are fighting for our political rights.'' Leaders of the strike, which began the day after the more restrictive election law was adopted, say the measure disenfranchises many ethnic Russians and other recent arrivals in the republic. Of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s total population, 65 percent are ethnic Estonians and 28 percent are ethnic Russians. While the Presidium was in session, a commission of Soviet parliamentarians toured Estonian factories hit by the strike and spoke with workers, said <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON>, another strike committee member. The panel of legislators met Tuesday night with the strike committee, <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. Under the new election law, residents of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> must live in the same district for at least two years or anywhere in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for a total of five years to be able to vote. Candidates for elective office must have lived in the same spot for five years or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. By declaring the law unconstitutional, the Presidium again was taking issue with the republic's claim of `` sovereignty'' proclaimed in November by <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet, which said the independent-minded republic could set its own policy in all fields except foreign policy and defense. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> authorities pronounced that concept invalid, but the Estonian parliament has stood by its vote. This year, Estonian lawmakers also declared Estonian the republic's official language and approved limited private property.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Negotiators for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and bank creditors announced tentative agreement Wednesday on a new debt package, allowing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to claim a second victory for its program to reduce the debt burden being carried by the Third World. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will receive new money in addition to a partial reduction in its $ 28 billion debt burden, about half of which is owed to commercial banks. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> agreement follows an accord reached last month with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the developing world's second largest debtor with $ 108 billion in loans. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hailed the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> pact as evidence that its initiative to reduce the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden was bearing fruit. Private economists, however, were less enthusiastic, saying the amount of actual debt reduction was likely to be modest both for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was briefed on the details of the debt plan Wednesday by top <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> negotiators, predicted that it would `` promote significant debt reduction while also providing new money.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10 unveiled the administration's new approach to Third World debt. The effort seeks to get commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the loans they hold in return for guarantees from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that the reduced debt would be repaid. In the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> agreement, banks were given the choice of reducing interest or principle on the old debt or lending new money. The same option of reducing old debt or supplying new money will apply for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, officials said. They stressed that the exact amounts of new money and debt relief will not be known until the commercial banks holding the debt make their individual decisions on which option to take. Philippine negotiators, who had been seeking new bank loans of as much as $ 1.7 billion, expressed happiness with the outcome of the discussions, which were held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the Philippine central bank governor who led his country's negotiating team, said that the combined effect of the debt reduction and an improving economy would eventually `` bring about the end of the debt problem for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> were considered two of the best candidates for the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> debt-relief plan. Discussions with two other leading candidates, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, are currently stalled. Private economists said that the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> initiative was still a long way from its goal of reducing the pool of commercial bank debt by 20 percent for the world's 39 most heavily indebted nations. `` This is an incremental change rather than an explosive change,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a research group specializing in developing countries. `` It would be a mistake to argue that there is great momentum behind debt relief.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said that the debt relief in the case of both <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was likely to be modest as long as the packages remained voluntary on the part of the banks. `` You need a coordinated effort and some type of enforcement mechanism that says everybody has to write off a certain portion of the debt,'' she said. `` If you are just piling new loans on old loans with little actual debt relief, all you have bought is more time.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pflug </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the leader of the bank negotiating team, said that the options of granting debt relief or providing new lending would appeal to two separate categories of banks: `` those that wish to exit from the process as opposed to those that have determined to maintain their credit relationships in the country.'' Both sides predicted that a final agreement on all outstanding issues with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> would be reached in September.

<TEXT>
 Dissident Czechoslovak playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> urged his countrymen to refrain from street protests marking the 1968 Soviet-led invasion because such rallies may spur a harsh crackdown by authorities. Monday is the anniversary of the Aug. 21, 1968, invasion that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms that briefly liberalized Czech society. In a statement dated Aug. 14 and released Wednesday by the London-based emigre publishers <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said he could understand that Czechoslovaks might believe street protests are the only way to vent frustrations. But he added, `` I personally believe there is no point in resorting predominantly or exclusively to this method of protest now ... when authorities are waiting exactly for this type of action in order to be able to strike hard to paralyze people's democratization for a long time to come.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> instead urged citizens to sign the petition known as `` A Few Sentences,'' which has garnered an estimated 15,000 signatures since it was first distributed in late June. The petition demands democratic reforms and negotiations with Communist authorities. It has come under fierce attack in the state-run media and from party leaders who have rejected the sort of political reforms occurring in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Protests during last year's anniversary failed to nudge the government closer to reform but resulted in at least three petitions for democratic change and an increased activism among dissidents. This year, authorities have warned they wo n't tolerate disturbances and will do what is necessary to maintain public order. <LOCATION> Czechslovakia </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> appealed to citizens to avert street violence on the anniversary, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> newspapers reported Wednesday. The committee was established on Dec. 9, 1988, in an apparent move to offset the rising wave of dissident protest, but activists say it lacks the courage to speak out against police brutality. `` Having the experience of January, we express our anxiety over the possible manifestations of demagoguery, general nihilism or violence in the forthcoming days,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal warned The statement referred to protests that broke out in January marking the 20th anniversary of the death of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, who set himself on fire to protest the 1968 invasion. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was arrested during one such protest and was jailed for four months. Several dissidents have been harassed in advance of the anniversary. Dissidents <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON> were detained in the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> on Monday, apparently in connection with the `` Few Sentences'' petition. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was detained twice in two days and warned to stay out of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Last week, six independent Czechoslovak human rights groups called for two minutes of silence at 5 p.m. on Aug. 21. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, 52, appeared to encourage his fellow citizens to be optimistic that change is coming. `` I am firmly convinced that a thorough revision of the official view of the August 1968 invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is irrevocably drawing near,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> cited Friday's statement by a Hungarian official that the invasion was `` essentially wrong,'' and a Polish <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution condemning the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling communists distanced themselves even further from the 1968 invasion. In a statement carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the ruling Politburo of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the party's `` present leadership ... does not concur with the 1968 military intervention in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' The Czechoslovak state news agency criticized the Hungarian statement as helping `` Czechoslovak and foreign anti-socialist forces. They, incited by reactionary circles of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, want, in contradiction with the historic truth, to misuse the events of 1968 against restructuring and democratization inh <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Small Mining Company Vows to Leave Tuscarora Alone But Continue Mining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSCARORA, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This 1870 mining boomtown that now is home to just a few people got something of a reprieve from a company digging an open pit gold mine that was intended to swallow half the historic community. `` Horizon affirms today that it has no desire to mine its way through a century of history of <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shares </ORGANIZATION>, told a public hearing Tuesday. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said the company, which originally wanted to expand its open pit into part of <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION>, will leave the main town alone, including three sites for which residents are seeking protected historic status. `` I state publicly that Horizon Gold will not invoke <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s eminent domain statute to mine within the original town site area,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, adding that trailers outside of town could be moved, however <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s statements came during a public hearing held by the <ORGANIZATION> Elko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to discuss giving historic status to an old rooming house, a Masonic lodge building and the town cemetery in this flyspeck on the map 250 miles northeast of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. The designation is sought by some dozen full-time and another dozen part-time <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> residents trying to block Horizon's efforts to expand its 2 -LCB- - year-old mining operation to get at ore reserves near and below <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, a town leader who has lived in <LOCATION> Tuscarora </LOCATION> since 1966 when he started a pottery school in the old rooming house, said he was wary of the Denver-based mining company's promise to leave town residents alone. He questioned why <PERSON> Horizon </PERSON> still plans to go ahead with its lawsuit to prove that the company through its century-old mining claims owns the town and that residents only have surface rights. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said the lawsuit, filed Friday in <LOCATION> Elko </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, is needed to settle once and for all the issue of who owns the land in the historic town built after gold and silver were discovered in the late 1860s. `` There are 125 years of confusing and often conflicting transactions that have given Horizon concern as well,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Some 80 people attended the 1 -LCB- - hour-long public hearing in <LOCATION> Tuscarora </LOCATION>, and 19 spoke in favor of designating the three historic sites in the town Only <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> opposed the status, saying the law specifically says that an historic designation should n't be declared just `` to hamper mining.'' The commissioners took no immediate action on the issue and set another meeting for Sept. 20 to discuss the proposal. Horizon employs about 50 people to work at the open pit mine 52 miles north of <LOCATION> Elko </LOCATION>. The company has invested $ 8 million so far in working the pit, now about 400-by-800 feet and 150 feet deep. At its 1870s peak, <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> had 4,000 residents and a 1,000-strong <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> population in the West at the time.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil rights leaders meeting here had intended to plan a political action agenda on Wednesday. Instead, they found themselves debating whether blacks have a single political party they can call home. In a heated two-hour session, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> agreed that blacks in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are coming to a political crossroads prompted by their wariness of Republicans and their dissatisfaction with Democrats. But the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> leaders had few answers for voters who say they do n't think either party is sincerely interested in their concerns. `` We do n't have to sell our souls,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the Joint Center for Political Studies. `` But until -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has those kinds of individuals who look like us and talk like us and are willing to stand up like us, the black electorate will not follow Republicans.'' Blacks have been particularly reluctant to join the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because they view it as insensitive to civil rights issues. They also say the immediate past Republican administration, under President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sought to turn back the clock on civil rights progress made during the 1950s and 1960s. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> recently has stepped up its efforts to court black voters, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been in frequent communication with civil rights leaders, voicing support for their cause. Civil rights leaders say they are waiting for action, particularly after recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions against affirmative action and minority set-aside programs. The <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>, which is convening in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this week, has lent a noncommittal ear to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights goals. <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> has met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and invited Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to open the convention. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeter </PERSON>, who identified herself as a black Republican, said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has failed to work for the roughly 90 percent of black voters it represents. She said she feared that could happen in either party. `` I'm no blind fool,'' she said. `` How can we work within the system when it has n't worked for us?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, a Democrat who represents the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said too much of the two-party system could dilute black voting strength, `` given our numerical percentage.'' <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed. `` I'm appalled by one-party domination,'' she said. `` It is incumbent on everybody in this room to check out the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I am not opposed to getting people out to vote Republican,'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said. `` You in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must have the courage to say to your party, ` This is not a game.''' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said that party identification is not a key question for black voters. `` The question will be: ` When I was hungry, did you feed me?''' he said. `` I'm not here to say the Republicans have the answer,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We as blacks should be cognizant of two-party politics. If it can work for other people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it can certainly work for us.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had been scheduled to participate in the political session, but did not attend. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke on Tuesday. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON>, vice mayor of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, cautioned Democrats not to assume blacks are satisfied with the party's treatment of their concerns `` We have been bludgeoned politically by Democrats,'' he said, adding that it will be `` infinitely easier'' for blacks to progress in both parties. The <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> convention, which runs through Friday, is being held in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the first time since <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> took over the leadership in 1977.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Wednesday welcomed the release of 29 political prisoners by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but condemned that nation's government for continuing to imprison more than 6,000 people for their politics. `` This step is long overdue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. `` We urge the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to release all political prisoners, including the 6,000 political prisoners they still hold, and the remaining 39 National Guardsmen who have been imprisoned since 1979 in violation of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' commitments ... to free them,'' he said. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Tuesday announced the release of 29 peasant farmers jailed for alleged counter-revolutionary activities and said his government would decide the fates of an additional 1,200 political prisoners by early September. The gesture appeared designed to encourage anti-government guerrillas to lay down their arms in the wake of an agreement among Central American presidents to disband U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The agreement calls for the demobilization this fall so long as <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> moves toward democratic reform. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said `` the release of political prisoners is always a welcome development.'' But he said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, by continuing to hold political prisoners, was violating an agreement reached two years ago among Central American presidents. `` The continuing imprisonment of political prisioners in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is a violation of the Esquipulas Agreement, which required signatories to issue decrees of amnesty, which I quote, ` shall establish all the provisions to guarantee the inviolability of life, freedom in all its forms, property and the security of the persons to whom such decrees apply,''' said <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> basketball coach, his players and the university community will be the focus of a six-month <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> research project on grief, an official said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> plans to look into how relatives, friends, fellow students, city and university leaders reacted and coped following the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 last December. A terrorist bomb exploded in the plane as it flew over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people, including 35 students in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>'s study abroad program A Clay, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, couple and three other central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> students also died in the bombing. Researchers hope to gather data on how people handle grief and how best to instruct counselors and others to deal with the bereaved. Researchers are especially interested in the emotions of Coach <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeheim </PERSON> and basketball team members who played in a game against <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> the night of the crash, said Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartone </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> won the game, 94-71. `` It was a controversial decision, and some observers felt it was disrespectful,'' <PERSON> Bartone </PERSON> said. `` Others thought it was the best thing to do. We want to see the impact of the decision on players. `` The Army parallels to this because, when a unit suffers major losses, often there is not a great deal of time for formal mourning before activities must resume,'' he said. The Syracuse project is an extension of a 3-year-old project by the department in which researchers have studied bereaved family members and those assigned to help families after a Dec. 12, 1985, charter airline crash in <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, in which 248 soldiers were killed. In <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, researchers also will study the effects on those who counseled the bereaved. `` We want to derive the human psychological lessons from the experiences, so other communities and individuals will be better prepared,'' <PERSON> Bartone </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Skinner Asks Action on Air Accident Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> called Wednesday for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to move quickly to to ratify a 14-year-old treaty that would increase compensation for victims of international air accidents, saying action is long overdue. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the bombing last December of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 `` serves to highlight the gross injustices that exist'' because current treaty provisions limit compensation to $ 75,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has wrestled with the compensation question for more than a decade. In 1975, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed the so-called <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocols to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Convention which would allow an increase in compensation for international air accidents by establishing supplemental compensation plans. While the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> twice has recommended the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocols be ratified, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has failed to do so because critics objected that proposed plans still did not provide for enough compensation to international air travelers. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered a revised supplemental compensation plan. It cast aside the proposed maximum compensation of $ 317,000 and proposed an essentially unlimited recovery plan per passenger which would be subject only to an overall limit of $ 500 million per accident. The awards would come from a special fund established through a $ 5 per passenger fee on roundtrip tickets for international air travel. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> never held hearings on the proposal before adjourning. In a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> asked that hearings be scheduled as soon as possible on the revised compensation package and that the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> act swiftly after that to ratify the protocols. `` I urge that your committee take the necessary action to bring an end to this longstanding inequity for international air passengers,'' wrote <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has recessed until after Labor Day and a secretary in <LOCATION> Pell </LOCATION>'s office said the senator was not in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Staff aides to <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and on the committee could not be reached Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid leaders said Wednesday they have scheduled a conference for Oct. 7 to unify opposition to the government, and asked foreign countries to make sure it is not banned. Organizers include Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize; <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON>, leader of the black miners' union, and <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, co-president of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition. In <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, the family of an anti-apartheid youth leader released last week said he was shot dead outside his home. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON>, 27, was freed after a prolonged hunger strike in protest of being jailed without charges. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> that black African nations might help arrange peace talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group if the process of Namibian independence goes smoothly. White South African business leaders, back from a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, said they tried unsuccessfully to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, to abandon violence. Organizers of the unity conference said its aim was `` to map out the most effective, shortest path to the ending of oppression and exploitation, and the creation of a democratic country.'' `` We expect the conference to be attended by thousands of delegates from all walks of life, representing millions of people,'' they said in a statement. Last year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white authorities banned a similar conference. The organizers, predicting another ban, said: `` We are alerting the international community to monitor the actions of the regime in relation to this gathering of the people.'' Officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations have been briefed about the conference, they said, and `` the current mood of our people is such that we believe they will defy any attempt by the state to prevent the conference from going ahead.'' A nationwide defiance campaign now under way in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is challenging various racial laws. <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON> was a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaMashu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> affiliate based in one of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>'s largest black townships. His brother <PERSON> Popo </PERSON> said a car drove up to their home soon after midnight and someone in it honked the horn. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> went outside and was shot in the chest by two blasts from a shotgun, <PERSON> Popo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, current chairman of the black `` Frontline States'' adjoining <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said: `` We are watching <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> very carefully on the question of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. If it fares well we are willing and ready to give <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> the benefit of the doubt. We might begin to ... bring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> together. The path is well marked out how we are going to do this.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, after U.N.-supervised elections in November. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Matus </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest business organization, visited <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> with two colleagues. They said before the trip they would confer with <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> and members of his government about political and economic developments in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but told reporters Wednesday they also held `` wide-ranging discussions'' with members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> executive committee. `` They said they could n't denounce violence because then there would be nothing to fight this country with,'' <PERSON> Matus </PERSON> said. `` We begged them to compromise their stance on violence, but to no avail.''

<HEAD>Disrupted Deliberations Resume After Juror's Murder</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The disrupted deliberations in the `` Night Stalker'' murder trial resumed Wednesday after the foreman said jurors had `` put behind them'' the murder of a juror. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the drifter charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies, shouted out an objection when the judge indicated he would allow the panel to return to its task with an alternate replacing the dead juror. `` I have an objection,'' shouted <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, using an obscenity. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told the judge: `` I believe a cloud hangs over the jury now, a cloud of sadness.'' He asked that deliberations be suspended for a week. Defense attorneys said outside court they feared that the jurors, grief-stricken over the killing of <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> by her boyfriend, who then committed suicide, might vent their anger on <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. `` He's the only target they have,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, ignoring <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s outburst, overruled <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s motions after interviewing the jury foreman. Asked about the atmosphere in the jury room a day after panelists learned of their colleague's violent death, foreman <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said, `` I feel it's somewhat tranquil. ... Everyone appears to have put it behind them.'' The judge then summoned all the jurors and told them to remember that the killing of Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, found shot on Monday, had no relation to the trial. `` Please understand that none of this had anything to do with whether Mr. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is guilty or innocent of these charges,'' he told the jurors. `` We must get on with the task that life has given us,'' he told them. `` No matter how deeply you feel about her death, it is in no way connected to the case of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 29, is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies. Prosecutors allege that <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is the devil-worshipping `` Night Stalker'' who raped, robbed and murdered victims in a 1985 rampage that terrorized <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Some jurors wept Tuesday when they were told about the death of Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, 30, who had sat beside them in the trial for the past year and had deliberated with them for 13 days. The alternate who was chosen to replace the dead juror was distraught at first. But by Wednesday she appeared calm as she sat in Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s seat in the jury box. <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> informed jurors that Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s live-in boyfriend, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, 51, had committed suicide on Tuesday, leaving a note admitting he had killed her over a domestic dispute. The deliberations have been troubled since last week when another juror had to be replaced by an alternate for sleeping during deliberations. That meant the jurors who had been deliberating for 13 days had to start their talks all over again. On Wednesday, they began for a third time. The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, told reporters: `` I'm relieved. I am grateful that we followed the correct path.'' No mistrial motion was made, and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he was uncertain whether there would be one in the future. `` I like the jury,'' he said, `` so personally I'm not crazy about a mistrial.'' In another development, the judge said he was issuing a bench warrant for the arrest of a defense attorney in the case, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who has failed to appear at recent court hearings. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, no relation, said his colleague was recently married and has been in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on his honeymoon.

<TEXT>
 Three computer hackers suspected of giving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> information from military and industrial computers worldwide were indicted on espionage charges, prosecutors said Wednesday. The West German government called the breakup of the spy ring, which gave the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret data from 12 countries including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` a major blow'' to the Soviets. In a four-page statement, chief federal prosecutor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers for endangering national security. The men, identified only by their first names and last initial, were indicted `` on suspicion of espionage activities for the Soviet intelligence agency <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. The defendents were <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, he said. The men were arrested in March. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> are in prison, while <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> has been released pending trial, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. There was no indication when the trial would begin. The full range of information the Soviets received is not known, but the espionage activities, first detected by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer specialist, had been in operation since at least September, 1986, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. The Soviets paid about $ 49,000 for the information, he said. The hackers gave the Soviets programs and passwords for computer systems in industrial and military areas. They also gave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a `` Security pack'' designed to prevent unauthorized computer break-ins, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said. The three men broke into computers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, he said. Among the systems to which the hackers gained access was a key <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> computer known as <ORGANIZATION> Optimus </ORGANIZATION>, according to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television. Other computers affected included some used by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and defense researchers, as well as computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> said. The defendant <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> delivered his Soviet contact agent `` Serge'' information in about 25 separate meetings over the course of 2 -LCB- years in <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Congressional Agency To Estimate 1990 Deficit of $141 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> projects next year's federal deficit at $ 141 billion, well above the $ 110 billion target in the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, figures obtained Wednesday show. The budget office, which provides <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with non-partisan fiscal information, also estimates that without further action, the shortfall will stay at about the same level through fiscal 1993 _ the year <ORGANIZATION> Gramm-Rudman </ORGANIZATION> requires that the budget be brought into balance. The new numbers reflect the recent enactment of the savings and loan bailout law and passage of the drought bill and another emergency spending measure. The figures are of limited significance because the budget office's forecasts are not used in the Gramm-Rudman process. Instead, it is the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> _ perennially more optimistic than <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> _ whose projections are counted by the law. In addition, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from its August recess after Labor Day, legislators will have nearly four weeks of work to find additional savings before the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1990. Among the measures lawmakers are already working on is one that would produce about $ 13 billion in savings from spending cuts and new tax receipts. If Gramm-Rudman deficit ceilings are surpassed, automatic spending reductions in defense and many domestic programs can be triggered. But <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s figures, which the agency officially releases Thursday, are noteworthy because they are respected by lawmakers and private economists, who use them to measure the fiscal effects of programs and legislative proposals. The executive branch plans to release its projections next week. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, it is widely expected that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> will forecast a $ 116 billion deficit for fiscal 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> projects a $ 161 billion deficit for this year, up from $ 155 billion in fiscal 1988. The budget office is projecting that without any further action, there would be deficits of $ 144 billion in fiscal 1991, $ 141 billion in 1992, $ 143 billion in 1993 and $ 128 billion in 1994. The 1991 Gramm-Rudman deficit target is $ 64 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted a $ 1.17 trillion budget blueprint for fiscal 1990 last May. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> estimates that if all the savings contemplated in the budget were fully achieved, next year's deficit would be $ 118 billion. Many of those savings, however, are not expected to be enacted. For example, conflicts between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> make a projected $ 5.7 billion in asset sales extremely unlikely. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> estimates the savings and loan bailout legislation President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed into law last week would add $ 14 billion to this year's deficit, $ 4 billion to the 1990 shortfall, and a total of $ 10 billion over the following four years. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s projections of the effect of the savings and loan bill are expected to be much different. Because the bailout's spending next year will not count on the budget, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> is expected to claim a savings of about $ 12.5 billion resulting from the measure's passage, according to the Republican staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister canceled a news conference Wednesday, giving no reason, and speculation arose that he wanted to avoid questions about Westerners held by pro-Iranian kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In a brief departure statement after three days in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said his visit was `` very successful and useful.'' He had a final meeting Wednesday with <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>, the Syrian foreign minister, but there was no immediate indication of what they discussed. Sixteen Western captives are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, half of them Americans. Most are believed in the hands of Shiite Moslem factions sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. After meeting with <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters `` our talks with our Syrian brothers will not have anything to do with the hostage issue, since this issue does not concern us.'' He said the visit to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was linked to fighting between Christian army units and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but official <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> media had indicated President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> was pressing the Iranians for action on the hostages. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally, has been instrumental in past hostage releases and promised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help resolve the crisis that began with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction July 28 of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s office said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had a message from <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> saying the captors of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> had assured him the American hostage's life would not be threatened again. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> also pledged to help obtain the release of all hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` for humanitarian reasons'' and condemned the killing of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> as a `` crime against humanity,'' said a statement from the office. Kidnappers holding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who was on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when abducted in February 1988, said they hanged him July 31, three days after <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was kidnapped. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s life was threatened, but his captors said they had suspended the death sentence. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> delivered a letter to <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> from President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who has indicated willingness to discuss the hostage question with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the contents were not disclosed. The foreign minister said his talks in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> centered on `` regional matters and bilateral cooperation.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and all the Western hostages. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

By contrast, 9 percent said they followed very closely the stories about the anniversary of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, the upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rock festival that got under way 20 years ago Tuesday and is being marked as a cultural milestone. The latest survey, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was done over a four-day period ending Sunday. The second-ranking story in the survey was the killing of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> by his Lebanese captors, with 49 percent saying they followed it very closely. Third, with 26 percent, was the passage in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of legislation to bail out failing savings and loan institutions. The percentage of readers and viewers who said they were following very closely the investigations of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> rose from 15 percent a month ago to 21 percent. Only 6 percent could identify <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> as the Cabinet officer in charge of the department at the time covered by the investigations. But 17 percent could correctly identify <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the diplomat under investigation as a suspected Soviet spy. Of 55 news stories included in surveys beginning in 1986, only the explosion of the space shuttle challenger with 80 percent, the rescue of a little girl who fell into a well in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 69 percent and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air strike against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> with 58 percent were followed very closely by more Americans than was the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crash. The only news story, of those selected for use in the surveys, that was followed very closely by fewer viewers than <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> was the coverage in May of the scandal that brought about the resignation of the Japanese prime minister and other officials. Only 6 percent said they paid very close attention to it. Interviewers questioned 1,250 adults, 18 and over, by telephone. Times-Mirror officals said the reported percentages might be off by four points or so, as a reflection of the general population, because of sampling error.

<HEAD>Drug Testing Program At School to Test Band, Debaters as Well as
Athletes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As many as 1,500 high school students involved in competition _ including athletes, band members, debaters and chess students _ could soon face drug tests under a proposal adopted by a suburban school board. The proposal approved for <ORGANIZATION> Homewood-Flossmoor </ORGANIZATION> High by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 233 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night is believed to be one of the first involving all students in interscholastic competition. Only a handful of high schools across the country test athletes for drugs. `` The feeling of the board is that these kids represent our school by wearing the uniform and carry our name in a different arena,'' District 233 Superintendent <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachford </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` There was a firm belief that anyone representing the school has an obligation to be an example.'' The proposal originated two months ago with football coach <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON>, who sought permission to test only those members of his team that he suspected might be using drugs. `` I wanted to be able to reach the kids I felt had a problem, but after all that's gone on, I realize you ca n't play God and arbitrarily decide who you test,'' <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> said. `` Even so, I did n't have the slightest idea it was going to wind up like this. Neither did the administration of the school in south suburban <LOCATION> Flossmoor </LOCATION>, the lone school in District 233, <PERSON> Rachford </PERSON> concedes. `` Coach <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> said he was willing to subject his program to this kind of scrutiny, so the administration researched the legal questions and decided to expand it to include all athletes,'' he said. The board went even further, amending the proposal to include all students involved in interscholastic activities. The final package was approved by a 5-1 vote. Board member <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerone </PERSON>, the lone dissenter, said she wanted to hear more from parents, teachers, students and others in the community before approving the policy. How the plan will be implemented remains to be worked out by the board, but the details will be of great interest to school administrators elsewhere. <PERSON> Rachford </PERSON>, however, said he envisions many obstacles. The school has 2,100 students; 1,500 were in interscholastic activities last year. `` We may be headed for legal challenges. Speaking practically, who pays _ the public, parents, booster clubs, merchants? Then, in what order do we do this and how quickly can we afford to do it? Random testing, or not? `` There are a lot of questions to be answered before we bring this proposal back to the board'' on Sept. 5, when the administration will submit a detailed plan for final approval, he said. `` It sounds like we rushed into this,'' <PERSON> Rachford </PERSON> said, `` but there was a lot of frustration that kids are endangering themselves and we're unable to make a dent. I think the idea is that any tool we can aquire would be an important step.'' Drug testing for high school athletes withstood its first legal challenge late last year, when a federal appeals court ruled unanimously that a high school near <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, could use randomly test athletes. Since then, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, athletic director at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCutcheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said he has been deluged with inquiries from coaches and administrators around the country. `` They all want to know how we are doing it,'' he said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a specialist in children's rights for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> case was very different from what was being proposed at <ORGANIZATION> Homewood-Flossmoor </ORGANIZATION>. `` In that case there was credible evidence that the athletes had a serious drug problem,'' he said. He also called the suburban school's expanded plan the first step down the wrong road. `` Anything that erodes society's expectations of privacy for students, I think, is trouble,'' he said.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> distributor of airplane parts and its president pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges that they conspired to sell doctored airline parts to governments, manufacturers and airline customers. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 42, president of <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hauppauge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts of mail fraud. The company pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy and mail fraud. Attorneys on both sides emphasized that no aircraft accidents were known to have occurred because of the parts, consisting of altered and falsely certified rivets and other fasteners. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> called much of the problem `` historical,'' saying the parts likely would have failed in their first few months of use if they were going to fail. But while many of the fasteners have been recovered or accounted for, many are `` in the stream of commerce; they're gone,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The counterfeit fasteners were distributed from 1977 through 1988, mostly in the early 1980s, prosecutors said. Court documents indicate the reprocessed parts were sold to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, the Israeli government, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, British Aerospace, <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION>, Sikorsky, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the Brazilian airline <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and Pan AM. Some of the parts were purchased for military aircraft including the F-111, the B-1B bomber and F-14 fighters, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and his company were accused of buying surplus parts from suppliers, and then having them secretly stripped and replated or relubricated at a facility that <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s customers had not approved. To make the parts traceable, prosecutors said, certification documents from the original suppliers were simply copied and submitted as the paperwork for the reworked fasteners. `` There's so much trust -LRB- in the industry -RRB-, if somebody gives you a part and it has a trademark on it, you believe that company did the work,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The Rice case, which grew out of a tip from an anonymous whistle blower in <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s company, is the first prosecution produced by a special federal task force called <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Contracting, or NORDECON. The task force, made up of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and several other agencies, has been investigating criminal practices in the aircraft parts and supply business. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> made no comment after entering his pleas. One of his attorneys, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubitzky </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> `` has never, at any time, done anything that jeopardizes the safety of the flying public.'' `` After two years of investigation, the government has yet to find anything, to prove anything ... is unsafe,'' <PERSON> Dubitzky </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> set sentencing for Feb. 16, 1990. Under plea agreements, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> faces five years in prison, a $ 250,000 fine, $ 250,000 in court costs, an additional $ 250,000 fine at the discretion of the judge and possible restitution of up to $ 1 million. The company could be fined $ 25,000 on each count and will share any burden of restitution with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. On Wednesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office also filed charges against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohlman </PERSON>, 70, a parts broker from <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Viejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for allegedlly conspiring with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> to pay kickbacks in 1982 to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Surplus personnel. The charge alleges the cash payments were not reported to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>State Department Declines To Say Why It Barred Cubans From Baseball
Tourney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had invoked a 1985 presidential proclamation to bar seven Cubans from attending a baseball tournament in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, the president of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s Olympic committee, German <PERSON> Rieckeoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampayo </PERSON>, protested the decision as an `` abuse'' and unsportsmanlike. The seven, one of whom was listed as a technician, applied as journalists. Five Cubans who had been granted visas to cover a boxing tournament in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> were permitted to remain. And another <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> journalist was approved. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s national baseball team is participating in the amateur tournament known as the Interncontinental Cup along with teams from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The 1985 proclamation declared all Cubans except diplomats ineligible for visas. But, a press office statement said, `` as a matter of practice, the department often grants exceptions to this prohibition to Cuban sports delegations.'' Forty-two members of the Cuban national baseball team were granted visas. No explanation was given for singling out the seven Cubans who were barred. `` After reviewing the applications, the department granted exceptions to only five of the journalists,'' the statement said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the decision was based on `` facts,'' but he declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Balk at Mention of Genocide</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are demanding that references to genocide be struck from texts in what rivals said Wednesday was a `` semantic battle'' stalling progress at a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> peace conference. Less than two weeks before the close of the international forum, the Cambodian guerrilla faction has balked over the word `` genocide'' and is insisting that Vietnamese civilians in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> be viewed as colonizers. The subjects are dominating discussions, diplomats say. `` Around these two themes they have launched an absurd and indecent semantic battle,'' Cambodian vice minister of foreign affairs, Sok An, said. `` They are blocking the work of the commissions.'' Working committees, which resumed closed-door negotiations Wednesday after a four-day break, are to submit conclusions to a session of foreign ministers that convenes for three days starting Aug. 28. Ministers from 19 nations and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> opened the conference on July 30 in the first concerted effort to lay the groundwork for peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late September, leaving the Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> fighting the guerrilla coalition, unless the peace talks find a solution. Pressing conference tasks include setting up an international control mechanism to monitor vietnam's troop withdrawal, an eventual cease-fire and an end to foreign aid to the various factions. Progress is `` very 50-50,'' said one Western delegate. `` But the mood, I think, is still fairly optimistic. ... It is a tremendous task to be accomplished in a month.'' Discussions are heated and insults have been exchanged between the four Cambodian parties, said one participant. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and the resistance, headed by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, remain opposed on all major points. The center of the conflict lies in whether the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should be allowed a part in a coalition government. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> argues they should not, but <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> maintains the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are less dangerous as allies than enemies. `` The priority now is to liberate <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Keo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasmey </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s delegation. `` We know that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the problem, but let the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people reject them ... in general elections.'' During nearly four years of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule, hundreds of thousands of people were killed. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978, driving out the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and installing another communist government. Both <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government and its Vietnamese sponsors refer to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> reign of terror as `` genocide.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said using the word `` genocide'' in conference texts allows <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to justify its invasion. The resistance claims there also are Vietnamese soldiers `` disguised'' in the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> military and up to 1 million Vietnamese `` colonizers'' who have settled in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s invasion and should be expelled <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s regime says there are less than 100,000. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is prepared to settle the issue outside the conference, according to members of his delegation, but the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> want to deal with it now. The issue is `` a bigger problem than it would have appeared a month ago,'' said the Western delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists Wednesday ordered workers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to join <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in boycotting their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest new rules that restrict movement of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents. A general strike shut stores, offices and schools in the territories for the second day, and at least 26 Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. The government announced that charges had been filed against an Israeli man for a traffic accident blamed for sparking the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising 20 months ago that has claimed 669 Palestinian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> lives. The strike call was made in slogans painted on walls in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and signed by the underground leadership of the uprising. The 50,000 Gaza Palestinians who hold jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were told to begin a two-week strike Friday, the day <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> begins enforcing a law that requires <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents to have computerized ID cards to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, underground leaders of the uprising ordered the 60,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to begin a weeklong boycott of their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest the cards. The protest could cost many Palestinians their jobs. Israeli employers have been under pressure from the government to replace their Arab workers with Israelis for security reasons and to lower the nation's rising unemployment rate. But leaflets ordering the strikes said Palestinians defying the call would be considered `` betrayers.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> who do not have the new magnetic-strip cards will be turned back at the crossing into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> starting Friday. However, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Arye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramot </PERSON>, head of the military government in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, said later Wednesday that some cards likely will be issued after the Friday deadline. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television report said 55,000 cards have been issued and estimated that 1,000 have been destroyed by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. The government began issuing the computerized cards two months ago to control the movement of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents. Cards are denied anyone with a criminal record or considered a security risk. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists have urged Gazans not to accept the cards and have entered towns and refugee camps to collect and destroy many cards already issued. Arab reporters said confrontations between soldiers and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on Wednesday were the most violent in recent weeks, but they gave no explanation for the upsurge. In the Askar refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers opened fire to disperse masked youths marching with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, the reporters said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, youths barricaded streets with rocks, burned tires and hurled stones at soldiers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Hospital officials said said eight Palestinians were wounded in <LOCATION> Askar </LOCATION>, seven in Jabaliya, and 11 elsewhere. The army confirmed five Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> area and said it was checking the other reports. At least 536 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and Jewish settlers since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. Another 95 Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israeli officials. Thirty-eight Israelis have died in the violence. <PERSON> Herzl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokovza </PERSON>, 29 was charged Tuesday with reckless driving and manslaughter in the deaths of four <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> in the incident that started the rebellion. Witnesses said <PERSON> Bokovza </PERSON>'s truck collided Dec. 8, 1987, with a car carrying four <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> laborers. The four Arabs were killed. Rumors spread that the driver had intentionally run over the workers to avenge the earlier stabbing death of a Jewish man, and rioting broke out. On Dec. 9, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets, burning tires and throwing stones at soldiers, as they have ever since. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Etty </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON> said the filing of charges was delayed by a long police investigation and crowded court calendars.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning for a Cuban-born congressional candidate, Wednesday declared that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> can not be normalized as long as <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> `` swims against the tide'' of political reform in closed societies. Making a 2,000-mile political detour on the way to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> for a three-week vacation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized the communist leader at a fund-raising luncheon for <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, who is seeking to win the seat held for 27 years by the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. `` As president, I will look for signs that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> wants to move away from subverting his neighbors, move toward more openness, more freedom for his own people. But until I see demonstrable change there will be no improvement in relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, to warm applause. `` It simply can not be.'' In a city where anti-Castro sentiment runs high among Cuban exiles, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> avoided any mention of a recent <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action ordering the deportation of a popular Cuban-born pediatrician accused of involvement in terrorist activities. Many local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officeholders and politicians, including Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, have called <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> a hero in a war against <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, 62, in custody here as an illegal alien since February 1988, has been linked to terrorist acts aimed at <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government, and to the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 people However, his supporters argue that he was acquitted of the plane bombing in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> told reporters she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed the <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> case on the way to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and he was `` very well-versed on it.'' `` It's not really a presidential matter, it's in the hands of ... the federal system,'' she said. However, she added that if a mid-September court hearing on <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s appeal does n't go his way, she planned to renew her appeal to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not comment on the matter because <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s case was under an appeal in federal court. The case puts the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in an awkward position, given <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> efforts to bring more Cuban-Americans into the Republican fold and the administration's strong condemnation of terrorism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped here to campaign for Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> _ whose campaign manager is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ on a roundabout route to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he will spend most of the next three weeks at his seaside compound in the resort town of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. `` It was right on the way,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked. He landed in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> late in the afternoon and went straight to the compound. The Republican state senator will face <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> in a special Aug. 29 election to replace the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was warmly received by the predominantly Cuban-American audience of about 600 people, who paid $ 1,000-a-couple for the luncheon. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, meanwhile, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 4, will address the nation on Sept. 5 on his new drug policy. It will be the president's first national address and will probably be an evening speech from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, although he said time and location had not been nailed down. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to unveil his plan for fighting drugs earlier the same day. `` The president felt it was a national strategy, an issue of concern for all Americans and it will call for sacrifices and hard work and he wanted to discuss it directly with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also discussed the war on drugs in Wednesday's political speech, saying `` the No. 1 issue in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the No. 1 issue indeed across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is drugs and the violent crime they spawn.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saved his sharpest comments for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` With <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> just 90 miles away, she -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> -RRB- understands the horrors of totalitarianism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments about <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> contrasted with his recent overtures to leaders in Communist-led countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In fact, he told his audience, `` We've seen how democracy is surging forward around the world and taking roots in outposts like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' `` Someday I'd like to see improved _ yes, normalized _ relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But that can not and it will not be as long as <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> violates the human rights of his own people; as long as he, almost alone in the entire world now, swims against the tide that is bringing sweeping change, democracy and freedom to closed societies around the world.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> picked up the tab for the political leg of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and then to <ORGANIZATION> Pease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, from where he was to take a helicopter to his vacation home on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience that `` with any luck and if the weather holds'' he planned to watch the lunar eclipse Wednesday night with family members in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, briefing reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on the way to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, dismissed a new <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC poll showing that 52 percent of those surveyed did not think Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to take over as president. `` We think the public does have confidence'' in <LOCATION> Quayle </LOCATION>, the White House spokesman said. `` We think the vice president is doing a splendid job.''

 Stockbrokers who peddle most low-priced but often risky `` penny stocks'' will have to obtain a new customer's written approval before buying the stock for him, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday The rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the fraudulent sale of penny stocks, which are usually not traded on exchanges or quoted on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> Dealers Automated Quotation -LRB- NASDAQ -RRB- System. Because most penny stocks, which usually sell for a few cents to a few dollars per share, are not listed with exchanges or NASDAQ, information about them is difficult to come by and fraudulent claims are difficult to dispute. Before the commission voted 5-0 to approve the rule, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the problem was of `` great concern'' to the agency. He and several other members of the commission noted, however, that most penny stocks and penny stock dealers are legitimate. Two weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with an alleged $ 10 million penny stock scam in which the companies' share prices were artificially raised before being sold at large profits. Last fall, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> created a <ORGANIZATION> Penny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which found that a key ingredient in penny stock fraud is the use of high-pressure sales tactics _ often over the telephone _ on small, unsophisticated investors. The problem, say industry officials, lies with unscrupulous salesmen who pressure investors to buy the high-risk stocks of new or small companies or, worse, with crooks peddling the stocks of sham companies. The `` rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse'' is `` the No. 1 threat'' facing small investors, according to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a state-level investment regulators group. In the first half of this fiscal year, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has received 2,462 complaints about penny stock frauds, compared to 1,510 for all of last year. `` This will help us in our investigations,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, head of the task force, said of the new rule. `` Here's something that will require writings to be made,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, who is also an associate director of enforcement with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The new rule will require brokers and dealers to obtain written purchase agreements from new customers before completing their first three transactions in stocks that are neither traded on stock exchanges nor through the NASDAQ system. The rule will apply to stocks selling at $ 4.99 or less per share or to stocks issued by companies with less than $ 2 million in tangible assets.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution Wednesday night calling for the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc, with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as prime minister. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, however, said early Thursday that `` I will not be prime minister. There are better people than <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'' for the job. But he added it was not his final decision. `` The final decision is will be when they nail up my coffin,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, was applauded loudly at the caucus of lawmakers from his independent Solidarity movement, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> before the vote. `` I never assumed that <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> could be prime minister and I do n't assume so now,'' said the shipyard electrician from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, who led the strike that created the independent union in August 1980. The post must be offered by President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. The two small parties were non-voting guests at the caucus. They have had a long alliance with the Communists, but agreed earlier in the day to form a coalition with Solidarity. In a show of hands from the Solidarity caucus, the indepedent movement's 161 <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> deputies and 98 senators endorsed a government formed by a coalition under <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s leadership. Only the five negative votes and 17 abstentions were counted. In a last-minute amendment, they altered the wording to leave open the possibility that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> could designate someone else to be prime minister. Asked who the coalition will propose for prime minister, Solidarity parliamentary leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will decide.'' He said it should be known by the end of the week. Before the vote, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> asked `` for a new coalition which will counteract monopoly.'' `` We came here to change <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. ... I am very grateful to our elder friends from the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for understanding my game. Together we will teach the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- pluralism, freedom and listening to others.'' The three parties represent 264 parliament votes, a majority in the 460-member <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, and theoretically enough to form a non-Communist government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is not a member of Parliament. Whether the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would turn over control of the government remained a question. In a separate meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers appointed a group to formulate a stand on the Solidarity resolution. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> proposed a meeting of all the country's main political leaders to find `` rational solutions'' to the governing crisis The resolution said, in part: `` We think that the parliamentary coalition of the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Solidarity is capable of forming a government of national responsibility under the leadership of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in which all political forces of our country could be represented, all forces which are determined to act in favor of political and economic reform.'' Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers met with their chairman, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, and said afterward that they `` fully support'' the proposal <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> originally made Aug. 7 for a Solidarity-led coalition with the Democrats and Peasants. The 27-member <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> caucus also met and voted for the Solidarity-led coalition, said its leader <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> on Monday announced in the face of opposition from Solidarity he was ready to step down and turn over his unsuccessful attempt to form a government to <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> has not accepted the proposal, and his party's legislators said they preferred joining with Solidarity The Communist Party chief described his party's situation as `` dangerous.'' `` We have entered a period of an open fight for power,'' party First Secretary <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told a closed meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers earlier in the day, according to the state's <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service. `` The situation is dangerous, but it is not time to put up our hands'' in surrender, said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. He alleged that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s power bid violated the `` round-table'' agreement reached in the spring between communist authorities and the opposition. Addressing the caucus on behalf of Solidarity lawmakers, Deputy <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON> called for intense reforms and a renegotiation of the round-table accords to bring about fully free elections in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in two years, instead of the promised four. A government headed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and `` spectacular quick decisions'' such as giving parliament control of state radio and television would help quell social impatience, <PERSON> Paczynski </PERSON> said. In a climate of economic deterioration and public discontent with the communist leadership, Solidarity has said only an opposition-led government will have enough support to carry out difficult decisions. The proposal has alarmed the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government of the neighboring <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has said the attempt to form the government could lead to the destabilization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and endanger the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance. To ease Soviet fears, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> promised Tuesday that in a Solidarity-led government, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would retain control of the `` sensitive'' ministries of defense and interior. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is `` very concerned'' about events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but he lauded as `` sensible'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s promise not to upset the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance. <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> added: `` We do n't interfere in the internal affairs of that country. The Polish people should decide themselves.'' Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiatr </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> newspaper, however, the the Communists `` will not take responsibility for the result'' if Solidarity forms a non-communist coalition government. More than four decades of government leadership by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> appeared shaky because of the governing crisis that stems from its crushing losses in the most democratic elections in the country since World War II.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s trade and industry minister, got an official invitation Wednesday to visit <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The radio said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> would travel to the southern Soviet republic in September or October, becoming the first Israeli minister to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> broke relations in 1967 over the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> war. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the invitation was extended by members of a Soviet Georgian trade delegation who arrived Tuesday for a 21-day visit aimed at promoting trade links between the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> republic and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There was no indication whether the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had a hand in the invitation, but it presumably has <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s approval. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s spokesman could not be reached for comment despite repeated telephone calls. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> delegation included <PERSON> Vazha </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingihadze </PERSON>, the republic's foreign trade minister, and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. It said the delegates were investigating possibilities of trade in the medical, agriculture and food processing areas. A delegation from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> that visited in April signed a cultural exchange agreement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There has been widespread speculation that the first minister to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> of the center-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister without portfolio. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> is considered a hawk even in Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. He was a hero of the 1973 war and, as defense minister, directed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> is known for dovish views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and agrees with the Soviet position that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should talk with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and trade territory for peace. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> severed diplomatic ties in 1967 to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of territories belonging to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. The two nations established interest offices in 1987-88, however, and cultural and tourism exchanges have expanded since. Analysts say Soviet republics appear to have greater flexibility in contacts with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> than does the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have no direct air links, for example, but an Israeli jetliner landed in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, in June to pick up 61 survivors of the December earthquake for treatment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> aircraft landed in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> again Tuesday, taking them home. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said recently that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should develop relations with each republic separately. Last week, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed on their first joint venture, to manufacture medical equipment. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement Saturday to create a joint agricultural company.

<HEAD>Jewish Group Applauds Pope's Statement on Covenant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Jewish group applauded Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s weekly talk on religious matters Wednesday, saying it had a different tone than two speeches earlier this month that the group had condemned. Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representative of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said the pope addressed the question of ancient Jews and their covenant with God `` in a manner that is consonant with post-conciliar documents and that is to be welcomed.'' His statement was released by the league office in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The group had protested following two general audiences in which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the Old Testament showed `` many instances of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s infidelity to God. The pope also said that God sent messengers to convert people and tell them of a new covenant to come. The Anti-Defamation League had said those remarks suggested the new covenant with Christianity had superseded the alliance with Jews. The organization had said it hoped the `` clock of Catholic-Jewish relations had not been tragically set back.'' But <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said Wednesday's remarks were in line with the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s 1965 document Nostra Aetate -LRB- In Our Times -RRB-, which officially dropped the accusation that Jews killed Christ. Following Wednesday's general audience, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said, `` It would seem that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is trying to clarify classical Christian theology in a manner that is consonant with post-conciliar documents and that is to be welcomed.'' He expressed hope that `` such clarifications may be the expression of an ongoing dialogue which is only to the advantage of the church, Jewish people and <LOCATION> humankind </LOCATION> as a whole.'' The pope spoke Wednesday about God's choice of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as his people, as expressed in the Old Testament, and the role of the Holy Spirit in the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The controversy over the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s remarks came at a time of tense relations between Catholics and Jews. A Polish cardinal recently suspended an agreement to move a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> convent at the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp, prompting protests from Jewish officials. Jewish groups said the convent and its Christian symbols offend the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died there.

<HEAD>China Fines Five Major Companies for Illegal Activities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government fined five state-owned companies millions of dollars for profiteering and tax evasion and urged officials to cooperate in its anti-corruption drive, official reports said Wednesday. Newspapers urged state employees engaged in embezzling, bribery and speculation to take advantage of a grace period that runs through Oct. 31 to turn themselves in. Those who turn over illicit earnings will be treated leniently, but those who try to conceal them will be severely punished, the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> has decided, major newspapers said. It was the latest move in an anti-corruption campaign launched this summer to counter charges of rampant abuse of official privilege _ a rallying cry of the pro-democracy movement crushed on June 3-4. After a 10-month audit, the government ordered the companies, including one linked to snior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s son, to pay $ 13.8 million in back taxes, penalties and restitution of illegally earned profits, Auditor-General <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Peijian </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet. Among the audited companies were two conglomerates closed by the Politburo last month in the crackdown on corruption _ the <ORGANIZATION> Kanghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Incomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Kanghua </PERSON>, under the auspices of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, was one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest foreign trade firms. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Pufang </PERSON>, runs the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Welfare Fund The other audited companies were <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's leading company for attracting foreign investment, the <ORGANIZATION> Everbright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> said officials responsible for illegal activities would be punished by state supervision and judicial action, according to <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> The report did not name the individuals and it was unclear who would be held accountable. All state industries will be subject to regular auditing and supervision from now on, he said. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pao </ORGANIZATION> reported that a <LOCATION> Kanghua </LOCATION> subsidiary in June 1988 signed a contract with an agency in <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province to buy 34,990 barrels of crude oil for $ 23 a barrel. The company earned about $ 74,000 when it resold the crude oil at a profit, the paper said. In another case, an Everbright subsidiary in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> purchased $ 7.2 million in the <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION> special economic zone, across the border from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, at a black market rate of about 6 yuan to the dollar, according to the paper. It then resold the money to the <ORGANIZATION> Ningpo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations at rates as high as 7.25 to $ 1, almost twice the official exchange rate, earning $ 516,000, the report said. The official exchange rate is 3.72 yuan to the dollar, but companies will pay much more for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Dollars, needed for foreign investment and to buy foreign technology and consumer goods. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said four of the five companies were involved in unauthorized foreign currency dealings. Meanwhile, the government announced Wednesday that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students, who for decades have enjoyed free schooling, will have to foot part of the bill for their college education. The new regulation, which goes into effect this fall, follows several new education measures designed to avoid student movements such as the spring pro-democracy protests. Those ended with the June military crackdown. The government has also cut this year's freshman class by 30,000, ordered the freshman class at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to undergo a year of military training, and ordered graduates to get work experience before starting graduate degree programs.

<TEXT>
 An 87-year-old blind woman who was mistaken for dead and nearly embalmed was released from a hospital Wednesday, giving no indication that she recalled the experience. As <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was transferred to a nursing home, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, in conjunction with other state and local agencies, said it had started legal action against the operator of two unlicensed nursing homes in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, including the one where Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> lived. Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> emerged from <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on a stretcher carried by two paramedics. She was quickly transported to the IOOF Odd <LOCATION> Fellow-Rebecca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where she was helped into a bed at the nursing home. Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> indicated she was unhappy at being moved. `` I just do n't appreciate going nowhere where I do n't know where I'm going,'' she said. `` I do n't feel good about where I'm going. Nobody told me nothing about it.'' Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> said the arrangements had been made and agreed to by family members, and that Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> had been told. `` I think this is the shock of having to change and be moved,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was brought to the hospital Aug. 5 after her murmurings startled a mortician who had been preparing to embalm her at the funeral home. The mortician, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, said he had been called to pick up Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> at a boarding home where she had been living at the time. When he arrived, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said, the woman was slumped in a chair and appeared to be dead. He said he placed Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> in a body pouch, zipped it up, and took her to his funeral home. As he was preparing to move her to the embalming table, he said, she uttered a sound and he immediately called an ambulance. Dr. <PERSON> Sajjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was stable and fully alert when she was brought to the hospital. `` She really did not know exactly what happened and how she was brought in,'' he said. <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> said medical tests failed to pinpoint what led to the condition that made Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> appear to be dead. He said he believes she may have suffered a temporary heart blockage that caused her to lose consciousness for several minutes. `` Being a blind person, she did n't know where she was. She has no idea exactly what happened,'' he said. <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> said he told Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> a few days after she was admitted to the hospital that she had been presumed dead and taken to a funeral home, but he said she had no real reaction. `` She said, ` Oh Lord, Oh Lord,' `` <PERSON> Siddiqi </PERSON> recalled. `` -LRB- But -RRB- she really had no emotional expression at all.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its action followed an investigation in which complaints were received about the facilities. The agency conducted unannounced inspections of both homes. The department said it: _ Asked Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s staff to seek legal action prohibiting <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, the operator of the nursing home where Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was found, from operating such homes without a license. _ Referred the incident involving Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> to <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>'s Medicaid Fraud Section for investigation of possible patient abuse or neglect. _ Asked that local officials file criminal charges against Ms. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> for operating unlicensed nursing homes. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but last week she told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that the nursing home had believed Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was dead because `` she had no pulse, no blood pressure, nothing. She was just gone.''

 The Christian commander welcomed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> call to halt fighting that has cost more than 700 lives, but there was no word Wednesday from the Syrians, who have ringed <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> territory with guns and armor. Shelling that has ravaged <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> became intermittent after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> issued its cease-fire appeal Tuesday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and allied Moslem militias brought up men, tanks and artillery to reinforce their siege of the Christian enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. An independent observer said privately the warring factions appeared to be observing a `` cease-fire of convenience. They are quietly bolstering their forces.'' Five months of artillery duels between the Syrians and Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s force of about 20,000 Christian army troops have killed 772 people and wounded more than 2,051, nearly all of them civilians. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Wednesday: `` The general unconditionally welcomes the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution. The resolution as we understand it is a package deal that involves not just a cease-fire, but also lifting of blockades and programming the Syrian military pullout from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls Syrian troops an occupation army and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an Arab League mandate granted in 1976, the year after the sectarian civil war began. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> made no immediate response to the truce resolution, which the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved during a meeting called by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. Earlier, Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> told Italian Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> he will try to `` silence the guns'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and promote a settlement among all factions in the country. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> did not elaborate in his reply to a recent message from <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> asking the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> leader to act `` in a decisive manner'' to end the fighting, the premier's officer said in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> read a statement that said, in part: `` The senseless bloodshed ... has gone on for far too long and it must cease. We urge in the strongest terms that all parties abide by the council's call for a total and immediate cease-fire.'' Syrian gunners shelled the Christian enclave Wednesday and the Christians responded by firing on residential areas of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Several apartment houses in the Moslem sector were set ablaze. Six people were wounded in Christian territory, police reported, but they said west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> suffered no casualties because `` most of the targeted apartments were evacuated'' during earlier shelling. Moslem security sources said the Moslem allies moved more tanks, troops and ammunition up to their positions along the 65-mile confrontation line with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s outnumbered forces. One said the Syrians deployed Soviet-designed T-62 tanks on the northern and eastern flanks of the 310-square-mile Christian zone and Druse chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> positioned scores of T-54 and T-55 tanks in the mountains to the south. The Christian area faces the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> on the west. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has informed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of `` red lines'' it can not cross during any military action, particularly in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, without inviting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> retaliation. Druse fighters, seen manning jeep-mounted machine guns and recoilless cannons, were seen in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for the first time since Syrian troops moved into the Moslem sector in February 1987 to stop factional war among militias. `` It seems we are heading for a new confrontation despite this cease-fire call; the militias are back,'' said <PERSON> Talal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosseini </PERSON>, watching his janitor fill plastic bags with sand to fortify the entrance of his apartment house. The Lebanese capital, divided into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors, has taken the brunt of battle. All but 150,000 of its 1.5 million people have left since the shelling began March 8. <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bader </PERSON>, a salesman, left more than a month ago for <LOCATION> Shehim </LOCATION> village southeast of the capital. He drove to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday to check his apartment in the <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haidar </LOCATION> district and found it shattered by a 155mm howitzer shell. `` The radio reported that our street was shelled. I came to find by apartment torn apart,'' <PERSON> Bader </PERSON> said, his eyes brimming with tears. The shell pierced a bedroom wall, blowing away his children's room and part of the living room. `` I'll move the fridge, the stove, the washing machine and the rest of the kitchen equipment to <LOCATION> Shehim </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It costs plenty of money to buy these things.'' Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, and Sunni religious leaders also embraced the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce appeal, which was broadcast by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lead competing Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinets formed during a government crisis in September 1988 that also led to a split of the army into <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem commands. The 22,000 poorly equipped Moslem soldiers, under Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, have stayed out of the current fighting. The artillery war began two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias that deprived the government of about $ 100 million a year in customs revenue.

 The leader of a Montana-based religious sect that is preparing for nuclear war said Wednesday she never urged members to purchase weapons, and denied that the church had been stockpiling assault rifles. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triumphant </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters after her 90-minute grand jury appearance that it is not the sect's policy to purchase or stockpile weapons. Mrs. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, her husband, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, and two other church employees appeared before a federal grand jury investigating alleged illegal weapons purchases by <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a 15-year staff member who handled security for the church. Mrs. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, known as `` Guru Ma'' or `` mother'' to followers of her Christian-New Age church, used the occasion to criticize the lack of a national civil defense policy. The church is building a large bomb shelter to house 754 people at its <LOCATION> Corwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, headquarters and members are required to build individual shelters beneath or near their homes, said <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON>, a church spokeswoman and the sect leader's daughter. The shelters are being built on the 12,000-acre <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in preparation for a possible nuclear confrontation between the superpowers, Mrs. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON> said. She contended the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is better prepared than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to defend its citizens and military personnel in the event of a nuclear attack. Even some members disagree with her prophecy predicting the start of a new period of nuclear tension beginning Oct. 2, the sect leader said. Church members are praying that such a confrontation will be avoided, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Prophet </PERSON> declined to discuss her testimony or <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s case, saying the proceedings were confidential and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s attorneys had asked her not to comment on the criminal `` I trust the legal process,'' she said. `` I want to give it an opportunity to work.'' Federal prosecutors said they can not discuss matters relating to the grand jury. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 42, was arrested in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> July 7 with documents concerning the purchases of $ 100,000 worth of weapons and ammunition. He was indicted July 25 on four counts of making false statements in the acquisition of a firearm. Church officials Wednesday continued to deny knowledge of the weapons purchases, which are legal, or <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s alleged use of fake names to buy them, which would be illegal. Documents found in the church-owned car driven by <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> indicated he was the church's chief of security and planned to buy enough weapons to outfit 200 people, federal authorities have said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> is staying at his parents' <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> home pending a Sept. 25 trial. A conviction carries a maximum five-year prison sentence and $ 250,000 fine. Among weapons confiscated by police were seven .50 - caliber <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> semi-automatic rifles that assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> characterized as `` capable of taking out an armored personnel carrier Other weapons included Korean assault rifles and Austrian sniper rifles and more than 120,000 rounds of armor-piercing and tracer ammunition.

<HEAD>Speed Limits Proposed To Curb Florida Boating Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> leads the nation in boating deaths and unless strict speed limits are set and enforced, the situation will soon become unmanageable, state officials said Wednesday. Department of Natural Resources officials opened three days of public hearings on proposed new boating regulations with statistics on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s exploding population of boaters and the casualties they cause among humans and the endangered manatee. Boaters killed 105 people in the state last year _ 2.5 times the national average _ and set a record in known manatee deaths with 29. That record has already been surpassed this year with 37 manatee deaths. The state has about 1 million registered and non-registered boats and 3.5 million to 4 million people operating them, he said. `` It's very congested out there now, and with 100 boats being added to the state total every day, we will double the number in the next 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellingson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION>'s director of the Division of Law Enforcement. `` Unless we find ways to deal with that congestion, we're going to have problems.'' A key issue is expected to be the state's proposal of a statewide speed limit of 30 mph on navigational channels in inland waterways. This would drop to 20 mph in 12 counties with large numbers of the sea cows. Except for a hodge-podge of local go-slow ordinances, there are no boating speed limits now. Local and county elected officials and regulatory agency staffers from <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suwannee </LOCATION> counties expresed support for the proposed rules, with some reservations and suggestions for fine-tuning. The 12 counties being considered for manatee-protecting speed limits are <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION>, Citrus, <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Duval </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION>. Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suwannee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said that while there was support for the DNR proposals, he suggested a maximum speed limit of 40 mph because of the importance of water skiing in the state. Skiers say it is impossible to carry out their maneuvers at 30 mph.

 The B-2 stealth bomber's second flight ended prematurely Wednesday when a low oil-pressure reading forced pilots to land the $ 530 million plane an hour after takeoff `` We do n't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with it and will have to check it out,'' said 1st Lt. <PERSON> Anu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> at 7:29 a.m. for a three - to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m. because `` there were some minor concerns with the oil pressure indicators,'' she said The two men aboard, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chief test pilot <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON>, were never in any danger, but they `` obviously would have liked to accomplish more,'' she said. `` We did achieve some of the things we set out to do, so we ca n't say it was n't a successful flight,'' <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON> said The B-2, a tailless flying wing, flew with its landing gear retracted for the first time, she said. <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON> also said the plane flew `` a little bit faster and a little bit higher'' than on the first B-2 flight in July. But <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> at the Pentagon later said the plane `` was flown to a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet and a maximum air speed of 180 knots.'' That is the same elevation and speed as during the July flight. The four-engine bomber, built with composite materials, is intended to carry nuclear bombs and, along with the conventional B-1, replace the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s aging B-52 fleet. It is under fire in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of its cost. Each of the B-2's four engines has an accessory drive. `` One out of the four drives indicated low oil pressure,'' <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON> said. Each accessory drive is like a transmission, connected to each engine by a shaft. The drives power air turbine starters and hydraulic systems, <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON> said. Air turbine starters are used to restart engines. The B-2's hydraulics apparently control its landing gear, but it is n't known if they are used to move flaps and other control surfaces, as is the case on many planes Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarius </PERSON> said there was no failure of the hydraulic system. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had planned to fly the plane shortly after dawn Tuesday, but the test was rescheduled for Wednesday because of delays caused by wind and a long list of preflight checks, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> tried to fly the B-2 for the first time on July 15, but the attempt was aborted by a low fuel pressure reading while the bomber revved its engines awaiting clearance for takeoff. After the flight was canceled, workers checked the aircraft and discovered a problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the bomber's fuel system. The problem was fixed, but no details were available. During the plane's July 17 maiden flight, <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> and Couch flew the B-2 for nearly two hours and reached an altitude of 10,000 feet. The government has already invested about $ 22.4 billion in the B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has balked at the thought of paying more than $ 500 million apiece for the 132 bombers the military wants. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed limits on the B-2 bomber despite fierce lobbying efforts by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to keep the program intact. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members are scheduled to meet in conference in early September to craft a final version of the defense authorization bill and settle their differences over B-2 funding.

 Port owners and longshoremen refused to unload Canadian toxic waste from a Soviet freighter Wednesday, but the British government insisted there was no danger. `` There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds these cargoes should not be handled,'' Environment Secretary <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> said. `` We have n't been and we're not going to be the dustbin of the world.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said later it would temporarily store the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> province.

Tilbury turned away the consignment, also from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, after protesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighter while television crews filmed from launches and helicopters. British newspapers have taken up the issue, with mass circulation dailies carrying such headlines as `` Ship of Shame.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Observer, usually sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, accused it this week of `` going overboard.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> is trying to block 15 consignments of PCBs from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that the British disposal company <ORGANIZATION> Rechem </ORGANIZATION> has contracted to handle at its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> plant in coming weeks. The company says it will `` defend its position.'' In <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s environment minister, <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, announced Wednesday evening that will be put in a <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION> storage facility in the province. She said the PCBs will be taken to <ORGANIZATION> Manic </ORGANIZATION> 2, a power generating station about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s hometown. `` This is a temporary solution as our goal is to dispose of the toxic wastes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> told a news conference. PCBs, which were used primarily to cool electrical transformers, have been banned in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of links with cancer. Government officials say <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has the techniques to dispose of the cargoes and has strict safety regulations for how they can be imported. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, waiting with 100 protesters when the freighter docked at <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seaforth </ORGANIZATION> container terminal Wednesday, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was `` encouraging the global toxic waste crisis'' by allowing the imports. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s only incinerator capable of handling PCBs is in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> and does not accept waste from other provinces.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to rally support for his battle plan against drug abuse on Sept. 5 in his first nationally televised speech as president, his spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has said he will announce a broad drug-fighting strategy on that date, `` wanted to discuss it directly with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The White House has not yet approached the television networks and thus has not set a time for the speech, he said. `` The president felt it was a national strategy, an issue of concern for all Americans and it will call for sacrifices and hard work for all Americans,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as the president flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president, in a meeting Tuesday with his <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and senior advisers, signed off on the broad planks of the strategy. But the spokesman added, without elaborating, `` There's still some outstanding specifics'' to be decided. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made up his mind on the controversial issue that had divided his advisers _ whether to withhold federal highway funds, criminal justice assistance and other aid from states that do not take steps such as revoking drug offenders' drivers' licenses and putting in place adequate drug prevention and education programs at schools, it was learned. However, it was not known which way the president had decided on that point. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to make the final decisions during his three-week vacation in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he headed after leaving <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Wednesday. The official said the anti-drug strategy envisions expanded use of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military to help combat drugs at the source in foreign countries, when those countries request assistance. He said that the price tag for what has been touted as a major cross-agency program is being closely held by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that he would not reveal the cost before Sept. 5 and that decisions were still being made on what programs elsewhere in government would have to be tightened to pay for an expanded war on drugs. He said his plan would require `` commitment and sacrifice and understanding `` by Americans. Nonetheless, there have been various reports of what the cost would be. An administation official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday night the cost would be `` roughly a billion'' dollars more than what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set down in his February budget proposal. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget called for $ 5.5 billion for anti-drug spending during the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, which would be a 21 percent increase from this year's spending. The administration official's report would imply spending of $ 6.5 billion, an increase of about 41 percent On Wednesday, at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> fund-raising lunch for congressional candidate <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The No. 1 issue in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and the No. 1 issue across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is drugs and the violent crime they spawn.'' `` A strong foreign policy, hopes and plans for our children and our elderly, all our dreams and best intentions will be for naught if we can not win the war against the thunder in the streets and the evil that men do,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, a Republican state senator, will face <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> in a special Aug. 29 election to replace the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. Drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, has called for a dramatic increase in drug treatment funds for 1990, according to a draft of his national drug strategy. The draft obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> revealed that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> wanted $ 925 million for drug treatment next year, a 49 percent increase over the $ 621 million in the current budget and a 26 percent increase over the $ 735 million that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sought in his budget request earlier this year. The draft also called for $ 1.2 billion for new prisons and the expansion of federal prison capacity by 85 percent, and for increases in most law enforcement efforts, including an additional $ 200 million for a total of $ 350 million for state and local enforcement efforts. In addition, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> sought $ 1.2 billion for prevention efforts, a 28 percent over current spending. The draft strategy also called for spending $ 50 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, $ 45 million of which would be used for security improvements.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> decided Wednesday to spare the life of condemned murderer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> although `` the evidence is persuasive to me that he is guilty.'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, 34, was to have died in the electric chair on Aug. 30 for the 1977 death of his landlady, <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who was stabbed repeatedly while her two children watched. They later testified that <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was the killer. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, labeled by his attorneys as borderline mentally retarded, had exhausted all appeals. He has insisted he is innocent for more than a decade. The commutation means that <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> must serve the rest of his life in prison without a chance for parole, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s decision came after private meetings with defense attorneys, prosecutors and with one of the victim's children, <PERSON> Theodise </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 24. Defense attorneys contended that <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was killed by an ex-boyfriend, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>. They say <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> admitted the murder in 1980 to a cellmate in a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> has a history of stabbing women and of intimidating witnesses, the defense said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> intimidated the <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> children so they would identify <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> as the killer. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, considering the defense claims last year, said there was no evidence to back up the allegations. The panel noted that <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> was given immunity and testified that while serving time in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for fatally stabbing his common-law wife he told a cellmate that <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> died in a similar fashion `` but he did not say or imply that he personally had any guilt in her -LRB- <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' -RRB- death.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> talked at length to Theodise Collins Wednesday about <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>. `` He asked me whether I was positive about the person who killed my mother,'' she told reporters later. `` My response was, of course, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. He asked if I had been mentally, physically or sexually abused by anyone -LRB- in connection with the case -RRB-, especially <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>. My reply, of course, was no.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he felt the two juries that tried <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> were wrong to give him the death sentence. `` The developments in this case have been several, which say that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> had no evidence of criminal activities, zero,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> had lived in that house next door for years with no violence. ... `` While there is guilt for <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, in an execution in this country, the test ought not be reasonable doubt. The test ought to be is there any doubt. ... He met the test for guilty but not execution.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> decided to stop the execution, she would not be angry, although she felt <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> should die. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> -RRB- has a job he has to do,'' she said. `` I do n't think the question is whether <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> is guilty or not. I think it's exactly what are we supposed to do with him now.

 Police on Wednesday said a West German free-lance photographer arrested under anti-terrorism laws has been charged with a weapons offense. A spokesman at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters said the photographer was charged Wednesday, but the spokesman would not specify the firearms offense or identify him by name. Sporadic rioting broke out in Roman Catholic areas of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Wednesday night, police reported. They said supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in isolated attacks threw gasoline bombs and rocks at security forces but that no injuries or arrests were reported. In <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, near the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blew up a Protestant-owned gas station with a car packed with explosives on Tuesday night. It said the bombing was punishment for supplying police vehicles. No one was injured. Earlier Wednesday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> deported <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, a leading American supporter of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, who was arrested in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Tuesday for defying an order banning him from British territory. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, publicity director for the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commiteee </ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION> Noraid </LOCATION>, was flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. News of the photographer's arrest broke amid complaints by officials that some foreign cameramen are provoking riots. Dozens of foreign television crews are in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to cover this week's 20th anniversiary of the deployment in British troops in the province, which is torn by Roman Catholic-Protestant strife. A police spokesman said the West German photographer was arrested early Tuesday in <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and is being held under <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prevention of Terrorism Act. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television report identified the photographer as <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>. Police refused to comment on British news reports that police found smoke bombs and other missiles in the trunk of his car. The spokesman said a French photographer was also arrested Tuesday but later released. Local news photographers supported charged the presence of foreign photographers has prolonged relatively routine stone-throwing in Roman Catholic areas. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said that in some cases cameramen actively encouraging youngsters to riot for the pictures. The <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, `` news does not need to be manufacturued.''

 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> was hospitalized for medical tests on Wednesday after complaining of fatigue, doctors said. Begin, who turned 76 on Saturday, was admitted to <LOCATION> Shaarei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tzedek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and will stay for `` a day or two,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON>, the hospital's director. `` He complained for the last few days about some fatigue, but nothing specific,'' <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON> said initial tests `` were negative, meaning nothing was found.'' `` I expect him to be released within a day or two,'' he said. Reports of Begin's hospitalization were carried on state television and radio newscasts. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio described him as `` walking around'' and `` in a good mood.'' Begin was admitted to the same hospital in April 1987 after complaining of weakness. He was discharged after 10 days of medical tests. Begin, the former leader of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, came to power in 1977. He resigned without warning in September 1983 and since has lived in seclusion in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. At the time, aides said Begin was depressed about the death of his wife and about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s protracted involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after its 1982 invasion of that country. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was widely criticized for the invasion and three-year occupation of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Begin suffered several heart attacks while prime minister and underwent prostate surgery in 1986. Begin seldom speaks in public. His last public statement was on July 9, when he condemned a Palestinian attack on an Israeli passenger bus that killed 16 people and injured 25. Most victims were Israelis.

 Two of the nation's four strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies held informal talks with telephone workers Wednesday, but both meetings ended with no progress reported in the 11-day-old walkout. The Communications Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> met at an undisclosed location in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area for the first time since picket lines went up Aug. 5in the dispute over wages and company plans to cut back health benefits. Wednesday's meeting ended in part because neither side would shift its position on whether workers should pay for part of their health insurance, officials said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said informal talks occurred between union officials and another regional telephone company, Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, but there was no progress to report. `` There's a lot of concern that the company has not moved yet,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said. `` The union would really like to see some movement from the company so we can get on with negotiations.'' <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said no further talks were planned. The companies affected by the strikes are: _ <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which serves about 50 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, a small part of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the five other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states Its companies have 60,000 workers on strike.

<TEXT>
 Cancer and lung disease, the legacies of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear tests carried out decades ago, are ravaging the reindeer herders who live across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> weekly reported Wednesday. The cancer rate among natives of the <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION> peninsula is 2-3 times higher than the national average, virtually the entire population suffers from tuberculosis and 90 percent from chronic lung disease, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the general radiation level on the peninsula was at least twice as high as normal and equal to the average dose received by people living in areas around the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. In part because of their drastically reduced immunity, the average lifespan of the natives, known as the <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION>, is only 45 years, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. The article attributed the unusual radiation to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. `` Peaceful hunters and reindeer herders who in no way participated in the conflict of the superpowers are now paying the most for big politics,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. The authors of the article, Dr. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupandin </PERSON> and historian <PERSON> Yevdokia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayer </PERSON>, said they visited one village on <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION> where they were told virtually every resident had cancer. Scientists measured up to 100 times the normal amount of some radioactive elements in some deer hunters, the article said. Infant mortality is also especially high among the natives, with up to 100 deaths per 1,000 infants, the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. The Chukchi, a Mongoloid people inhabiting the northeastern-most portion of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, traditionally settle in small groups and live off hunting and fishing. The article in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News was one of many to appear in the Soviet media recently denouncing the conditions in which the peoples of the Soviet Far North live.

<TEXT>
 The state's request for testimony on the destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> oil-spill records has been denied again, and the attorney general said Wednesday he will not pursue the dispute further. The dispute began in July when <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a fired computer operator for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, admitted he had accidentally destroyed the computerized records He said his superiors were negligent in protecting them. Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said then the destruction was `` potentially a loss of devastating proportions'' to the state's investigation of the nation's worst oil spill A judge last month granted the state a hearing to question <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> employees involved in the records destruction, but two days later he canceled the hearing and ordered <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to explain what happened in affidavits instead. Exxon officials said the destroyed records were on obsolete backup tapes and that other copies existed in computer archives. In court documents, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the backup tapes were routinely `` recycled.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> disputed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s version of the incident in an affidavit. The state also obtained an affidavit from a contract employee who had worked on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s computer system. The employee termed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s affidavits misleading, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Boness </PERSON>, an attorney for the state <PERSON> Baily </PERSON>, dissatisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s explanation, asked the court again to let the state take testimony from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> employees. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON> denied the request without comment in an order signed Friday. <PERSON> Shortell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> attorneys did not return phone calls for comment Wednesday. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said the state could have gained a more thorough understanding of the records incident if it had been allowed to question <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> employees under oath. `` I'm still reluctant to accept the representations of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The judge's decision effectively ends the dispute for now. The issue remains alive, however, in a lawsuit <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> filed last month against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, alleging the oil company wrongfully fired and slandered him. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said a pretrial hearing will be held within the next few weeks in the state's negligence lawsuit filed Tuesday against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and about 140 other lawsuits related to the March 24 oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. With the many lawyers involved, a large degree of cooperation will be necessary to prevent the process from getting bogged down, he said. The state's lawsuit, which also names the six other oil companies that own <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to bring in more attorneys. The state has had up to 25 lawyers working on its case, <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Three militants of the Marxist opposition party will stand trial in October for allegedly plotting a coup earlier this year. Senior High Court Magistrate <PERSON> Ramraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagnandan </PERSON> ruled Tuesday night that the three farmers from the country's eastern district of Demerara conspired to overthrow the government of President <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> by force. The announcement came after six weeks of hearings in which defense lawyers and the prosecution debated the admissibility of confession statements allegedly made by <PERSON> Bhokpertap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Karran </PERSON> <PERSON> Persaud </PERSON> <PERSON> Deokarran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Wordsworth </PERSON>. The defense alleged police had kidnapped the men from their homes in May, tortured them for a week, forced them to confess, then announced their detention publicly. The confession statements were accepted by the court, a decision criticized from opposition parties. The three militants of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are in prison awaiting trial. The government's case rests on allegations that the men conspired with others to train people to make explosives and use firearms. Their arrest in May came just a few days after <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> warned of a plot to topple his government. His People's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has ruled this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1966. The opposition has regularly accused it of rigging elections. In April and May, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> was rocked by a six-week strike, food riots and arson attacks on public buildings. The unrest was triggered by government austerity measures, including a devaluation of the <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> dollar, which prompted a 300 percent increase in food prices.

 A grenade exploded on a busy street Wednesday morning, injuring two people, police said. It was the latest in a series of terrorist attacks over the past two months. Bombings on Tuesday night damaged the headquarters of two human rights organizations. No organization has claimed reponsibility for any of the attacks, which have killed two people and injured dozens of others, but President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> recently blamed rightist forces. Right-wing political parties reject the assertion. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, a fire department spokesman, said that unidentified assailants threw a grenade on a busy street Wednesday morning, injuring two passers-by. Both were hit by flying fragments when the grenade went off, <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> said. He added that both were taken to a hospital for medical attention. The attack came after the headquarters of two human rights groups were bombed Tuesday night. At Brigades for Peace, none of the five people in the building at the time was injured, said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON>, who answered the phone at the office. He did not give his last name. Brigades for Peace, which has affiliated groups around the world, searches for peaceful solutions to conflicts. Another organization, <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, was bombed Tuesday night. It is made up of people whose family members have been kidnapped. <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <ORGANIZATION> Nineth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montenegro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garcia </ORGANIZATION>, said 15 young people were in the building when it was bombed, but they were not injured. The wave of bombings began June 19, when unidentified attackers bombed private television station Channel 7, killing a technician.

<HEAD>Abused Gorilla Babies Get Special Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Keepers at <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION> Zoo have been donning gorilla suits and expertly aping simian behavior in an effort to succor a couple of abused gorilla infants. The zoo's gorilla family has been in a turmoil since the reigning silverback male, <PERSON> Samson </PERSON>, died in March 1988, leaving the clan leaderless. His offspring, <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON>, a 16-month-old female, and <PERSON> Kwisha </PERSON>, a male about the same age, were injured when they were infants, then rejected by their mothers. As a result, keepers at the zoo southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were given the job of putting on a gorilla suit and spending countless hours acting as surrogate mothers to the battered infants. `` Zoo policy is to leave all babies with their mothers _ to let their mothers raise them,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the zoo's curator of primates. `` The past three months, we've been trying to reintroduce our two infant gorillas to their moms, after we had to take the babies away for their own safety,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. While abuse of the young is not ordinarily a problem in gorilla society, <PERSON> Kwisha </PERSON> got a broken arm in a tug of war between his mother and a childless female gorilla who tried to steal the infant. After a veterinary surgeon fixed the arm, the keepers tried to give <PERSON> Kwisha </PERSON> back to his mother. `` She picked him up, then put him back down and no longer would touch him,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` We kept trying, but she would n't pick him up.'' `` She was n't aggressive toward him. I suspect her refusal had something to do with his inability to cling. His one arm was functionless, and gorilla infants stay with their mothers by holding on very tightly to that fur.'' With <PERSON> Kwisha </PERSON> abandoned, the zoo staff had no choice but to raise the infant. <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON>'s story was a little different. She was injured somehow, perhaps by her mother, <PERSON> Babs </PERSON>, rolling over on her while sleeping, and sustained some slight brain damage. The youngster acted neurotic, sitting with her arms clenched to her chest and her thumbs held tightly in her fists. `` And every time her mother touched her, <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON> screamed,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON> was taken from her mom and treated for a fever. About a week later she was given back to <PERSON> Babs </PERSON>, who then ignored her. <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON> persisted in trying to cuddle up, but <PERSON> Babs </PERSON> finally had it and wheeled about and bit her daughter on the face and rump. Suddenly the the zoo had two baby gorillas they had to raise. One keeper suggested buying stuffed gorillas and putting them with the babies. This idea evolved into the gorilla suit. `` We were n't sure what they'd learn from all this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` But we wanted them to get used to the idea of something very large, black and hairy.'' Little by little, however, the young gorillas seem to be improving and gaining acceptance back with the clan. Last week, <PERSON> Kwisha </PERSON> spent his first night alone with his mom. And then a few days ago, <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON> felt brave enough to walk into her mother's cage, the keepers nervously standing by with fire hoses in case <PERSON> Babs </PERSON> attacked her daughter again. But all went well, and the next day <PERSON> Kwizera </PERSON> was seen riding on her mother's back.

<HEAD>Study Shows Treatment Prolongs Life Of Prostate Cancer Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new treatment can extend by 7.3 months the average life of victims of prostate cancer, the No. 1 male cancer in the nation, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> study has found. `` This -LRB- is -RRB- not a cure, not a quantum leap forward,'' said Dr. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, who coordinated the study of 617 patients at health centers around the nation. It is `` a step in the right direction and one that we feel is important,'' he said. The study was detailed in the Thursday issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, an associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the treatment is for what he called `` an ignored male disease.'' `` This year it surpassed lung cancer as the No. 1 cancer in men,'' he said. He said about 103,000 males in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> develop prostate cancer each year, and 28,000 die. `` We increased survival rates by patients 7.3 months or 27 percent,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. `` We did that without adding any extra toxicity.'' The current survival rate is about 2 -LCB- years. He said the cancer is curable if caught early enough, but most men do not see their physicians for checkups regularly enough to do so. The treatment in the study is for those who have the more advanced cancer, which spreads to other parts of the body, usually bones. `` Prostate cancer right now is where breast cancer was 10-15 years ago,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. At the advanced stage, it is not curable but is controllable, he said. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the treatment involves administering two drugs, both of which work on the level of the male hormone, testosterone, which is needed by the cancer cells to multiply. One drug, leuprolide, lowers the body's overall level of the hormone, while the second, fultamide, blocks the receptors of the cancer cells where testosterone connects, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. This was the `` first study in years to show a positive effect on survival rate,'' he said.

 The brother of a man identified by police as a suspect in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial murder investigation said Wednesday he has proof that his brother was on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> when the first victims disappeared. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said his brother, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is `` more a scapegoat than he is a suspect'' in the `` reckless'' investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe in my brother's innocence,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said at a news conference he held at a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> parish hall one block from his ailing father's home. He gave reporters a list of credit card charges and four photographs he said are from a month-long vacation when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and his parents visited him and his family in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in July 1982, during the time the first <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims disappeared. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he has given the information and photographs to <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Task </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> investigators, who interviewed him at his father's home Tuesday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 38, has not been charged in any of the 48 deaths or disappearances of women between 1982 and 1984 linked to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killer. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is completing a jail sentence in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for a 1979 burglary and 1981 escape from a work release center. `` The task force has been reckless in their investigation and have done nothing but harass my brother, family and friends,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, complaining that investigators waited more than seven months after <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' arrest in January to contact him for information about his brother's whereabouts during 1981-85. Task force officials did not return numerous phone calls Wednesday. Police last month searched two <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> residences where <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> lived while attending <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators carted away truckloads of materials, including a collection of police badges, videotapes and other paraphernalia. In a lengthy affidavit used to obtain a search warrant, authorities labeled <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> `` a viable suspect in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> homicides, and possibly others in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he only recently obtained a copy of the affidavit and spent two weeks compiling the information that he said clears his brother in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigation. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said his family had decided to hold a news conference before he was contacted by the task force Tuesday. He said he is researching more information that will prove his brother was not in the areas where other <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims disappeared at the time of those crimes. His brother also accompanied his parents on a trip to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, in late April 1984 around the time of another <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> disappearance, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 37, a senior chief petty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s submarine base at <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, is on temporary humanitarian leave to care for his father, who is recovering from surgery <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> walked away from a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> work release facility where he was completing a one-year sentence in 1981 for burglary of a police equipment store. Since then, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> used several aliases while living at <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, where he was in the fourth and final year of law school when re-arrested in January. His name was one of several that surfaced after the nationally syndicated show `` Manhunt'' television program aired Dec. 8 on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> slayings. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he knew his brother had been in jail but was unaware he was a fugitive when he drove his parents to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1982. The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigation takes its name from the river south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where the bodies of the first five victims were found in 1982. The killer is believed responsible for the deaths of at least 40 women and is suspected in the disappearances of eight others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1985.

 About 100 students blocked a street and hurled rocks and sticks at police Wednesday to protest the closing of three high schools where pupils demonstrated against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government. No injuries were reported. Witnesses said they saw armed men dressed in civilian clothes detain one student during the two-hour clash on a street between the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> and the Arts and <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Police fired tear gas to try to break up the protest. At least twice, the students, from 13 to 16 years old, picked up unexploded cannisters and tossed them back at police. Several policemen were visibly affected by the gas. A torrential rain ended the demonstration. Students said they blocked Bolivar Street to protest the indefinite closing of two high schools in <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION>, in the western part of the country, and one in Colon, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, after anti-government demonstrations last week. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has warned that it will close any school where there are disturbances in the weeks before the scheduled change of government Sept. 1. One student died and several others were injured at the university Aug. 3 when police fired birdshot to break up a demonstration. Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s term expires Sept. 1, but the lack of a successor threatens to create a vacuum in the government. International observers say the opposition defeated the government presidential candidate by a landslide in May 7 elections, which the government annulled. The opposition is demanding its victory be recognized so it can take power and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a post that makes him the country's de facto leader. Government and military representatives have refused both demands, but continued talks with the opposition on Wednesday. An Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mission that has been mediating the talks is to report on progress on Aug. 23. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking and money laundering charges.

 Many who lost loved ones in the nation's second-worst air disaster fear they'll relive the tragedy when liability suits come to trial in October, said a member of a support group for relatives of crash victims Northwest Flight 255 crashed at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport in suburban <PERSON> Romulus </PERSON> on the hot, humid night of Aug. 16, 1987, killing 154 people on board and two people on the ground. The jet failed to gain altitude during takeoff and slammed into an overpass on Interstate 94. The sole survivor was <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichan </PERSON>, then 4. The little girl is living with her aunt and uncle, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumpkin </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, shielded from media inquiries. She lost her mother, father and 6-year-old brother in the crash. About 300 people, family and friends of the dead, met on a grassy hillside overlooking <LOCATION> Middlebelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> at Interstate 94, where the jetliner broke apart in flames moments after takeoff. `` As long as some of us can manage to walk up that hill, we will be here,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, who heads a survivors' support group. The site has been decorated with wooden carvings of white-painted doves, each bearing a victim's name and arranged to form the number `` 255.'' For a second consecutive year, survivors who met at the hillside held small flashlights to illuminate the flight number at 8:46 p.m. EDT _ the time of the crash. `` All the people here _ they know what you've experienced. They know how you feel,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelhart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, whose sister, brother-in-law and two nephews died in the crash. The two years have n't erased the pain, she said. `` It's hard to get used to. You still expect to see them walk through the door,'' she said of <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Byelich </PERSON>, 48, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Byelich </PERSON>, 46, and their sons <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Brad </PERSON>, 14. `` I would say the first year was a breeze compared to the second year. It's like reality has set in,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Polec </PERSON>, an organizer of Flight 255: Their Spirit Lives On, a support group for those who lost relatives and friends in the crash. `` We have the memories of our loved ones, but they are so painful,'' she said. `` And it's getting closer to the trial and that's going to open up the wounds again.'' The liability trial is set for Oct. 2 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Northwest attorney <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubuc </PERSON> says it could take four to five months to settle the 102 suits pending against <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, which built the MD-80 plane that crashed. Forty-six suits have been settled, <PERSON> Dubuc </PERSON> said. Officials for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest airline, say the company has rebounded from the disaster. A record number of passengers are expected to fly Northwest this year. Record profits of $ 35.5 million were reported in 1988. `` The passage of time tends to make an event like that less vivid in the minds of traveler,'' <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. `` Most airlines that experience this sort of tragedy note a decline in passengers immediately after the accident, but normal levels return shortly thereafter.'' In May, the nation's fourth-largest airline launched a new corporate identity program, complete with a new logo, repainted jets and new uniforms for flight attendants. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> says the changes were made to spruce up the image of the expanding company and unrelated to the crash. At <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, emergency plans have been altered and fine-tuned as a result of the tragedy. Some of the lessons learned two years ago will be used during a mock disaster drill in September, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, director of the Emergency Management Division for the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The sheriff's department has arranged for a hotel to house families of passengers in the event of a plane crash, and a corps of multilingual chaplains of all denominations has been established to console families.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is engaging the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in a mild war of words over attempts by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity trade union to form a non-communist government in that Soviet bloc country. `` Questions involving the government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are properly an internal affair,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 Newspapers are being flooded with anonymous letters from an unusual source _ disgruntled gendarmes, the military corpsmen who make up almost half of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 200,000 police officers. Government officials have replied by saying reforms will be proposed this fall, and in the meantime the gendarmes should think about the soldier's duty not to air the military's dirty laundry in public. National and regional newspapers have received dozens of letters, each purporting to speak for a large number of gendarmes who are unhappy about pay scales, long hours and poor living conditions in barracks. The 90,000 gendarmes are responsible for police duties on most French highways and in rural areas, although they also sometimes patrol in cities. Special squads fight terrorism, monitor river traffic and patrol airports, among other tasks.

 When <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> first visited this community nestled in a lush <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> valley eight years ago, the country music entertainer could n't believe his eyes. Vehicles bearing license plates from nearly every state stretched bumper-to-bumper for miles on the winding main strip, creeping past miniature golf courses, go-cart rides, water slides and arts and crafts shops swarming with tourists. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> also noticed long lines of people waiting to get into country music theaters where local performers sang, put on skits and told corny jokes in a wholesome, family atmosphere. `` I was amazed. I said, ` What is this doing here in the middle of nowhere?''' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> says. The Grammy-winning guitarist and co-host of television's `` Hee Haw'' had stumbled on what local promoters call the country music show capital of the world. With about 20 glittery theaters lining <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> 76, better known as 76 Country Music Boulevard, <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> is also billed as the Las Vegas of country music _ but with an emphasis on family. `` You can see more <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> stars in <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> than you can in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> or anywhere else,'' boasts <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, executive manager of the local chamber of commerce. The list of performers appearing in <LOCATION> Branson </LOCATION> this summer reads like a Who's Who of country music: <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fricke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> <PERSON> Twitty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Gatlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Highway 101, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Milsap </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandy </PERSON>. City officials estimate that at least 3.25 million people saw country music shows in <LOCATION> Branson </LOCATION> last year during the peak June-August tourist season. Several theater owners say business is even better this year, and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> is considering staying open year-round instead of closing in the winter months. `` I found out after I became acquainted with <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> that everyone else in life knew about it but me,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` I run into people in almost every state who say they plan <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> every year as part of their vacation.'' <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> has a population of 2,500, but on a typical summer day tourists swell the southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> town to 30,000 or more. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> predicts that 5 million people will visit <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> this year, up 1 million from 1988. That's more people than annually visit Yellowstone Park or the Grand Canyon. Vacationers are drawn by the breathtaking mountain scenery, the camping, fishing and boating available at several huge lakes nearby, and two old-time theme parks, Silver Dollar City and Shepherd of the Hills. And, of course, they come to hear country music. From theaters seating a few hundred people to an outdoor ampitheater with a capacity of 15,000, <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> offers more than 40,000 seats for country music shows. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> liked what he saw in <LOCATION> Branson </LOCATION> and spent $ 12 million to build a 1,200-seat theater and a 191-room hotel and convention center featuring a smaller Las Vegas-style showroom. He was the first to regularly feature top-name entertainers. Soon <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fender </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boxcar </PERSON> <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brass </LOCATION> opened theaters along the heavily developed strip, where land is scarce and commands more than $ 2,000 a square foot. `` It's no longer possible for anyone to come in and start a theater on a shoestring,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> says. `` It's now become big business and big money.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who plays about 30 dates a year in his own club, compares <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> to the atmosphere that existed in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, the recording capital of country music, 50 years ago. `` Not to take away from <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> is commercial,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, relaxing in his plush travel bus after a matinee performance at his Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre. `` Here, the music industry is treated in its true art form. I've often said the most fun I've ever had in my life was when I played for free You're not performing, you're just playing country music. That's sort of the attitude of country music in <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>.'' Several of the shows are family operations. The <PERSON> Mabe </PERSON> family has run and starred in their Baldknobbers Hillbilly Jamboree for 30 years, initially starting with 25 folding chairs. Today the <ORGANIZATION> Baldknobbers </ORGANIZATION> play to packed audiences in a 1,700-seat theater. `` There was a lot of worry about the future of these family run theaters when the big-name stars came to the area,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilyeu </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Baldknobbers </ORGANIZATION>' show for the last 20 years. `` But the more shows that come in, the more our business grows.'' <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>'s country music success can be partly attributed to its central location. `` Our major market is the haven of country music, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` People from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> through the ages have been our big drawing cards.'' In addition, country and bluegrass music have flourished in these rugged Ozark hills for years. Many country stars got their start on `` Ozarks Jubilee,'' a live nationally televised show in the 1950s that originated in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> has his way, <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> will step further into the national country spotlight. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> says he's working to develop a television show such as `` Ozark Jubilee'' that would be based in <LOCATION> Branson </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, was the daughter of `` Jubilee'' host Red Foley. `` I think the time is right for it,'' he said.

<HEAD>City, Rural Budget Tradeoff Highlighted by Airline Subsidy Dispute</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's a tradeoff that helps to smooth the process of governing: while the big money goes to the cities, small town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> gets a piece of the federal budget for its cherished programs, even when they flunk efficiency formulas. That does n't cost a lot and it can oil the machinery of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where some of the power brokers of the appropriations process are veterans who come from rural districts. But the traditional bargain is running head-on into the federal budget crunch these days, with spending caught between an administration that vows no new taxes and a law that enforces decreasing ceilings on the federal budget deficit. That strain was showing as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> dealt with transportation appropriations just before its summer recess. The program at hand was a rural favorite called <ORGANIZATION> Essential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, under which airlines get subsidies for maintaining flights in and out of small cities. It was vital to the 1978 compromise in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to deregulate the airlines, giving them broad leeway to set their own routes and fares. The program has been extended at least through 1998, but not the money to fund it. Appropriations are handled year by year, and they have been shrinking. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted $ 25 million in subsidies for the current fiscal year; the bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cuts that by more than half for the next year. The administration wanted to do away with <ORGANIZATION> Essential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> subsidies entirely; its budget says that subsidies were costing up to $ 500 a passenger on flights in and out of some small airports, most of them serving only a handful of passengers each day. The House bill appropriates $ 12.4 million for the program in a bill that was designed to cut the number of communities getting air passenger subsidies from 110 to 48. That was going to be done by setting new rules to limit the subsidy to no more than $ 25 per passenger _ matching the estimated cost of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> rail subsidies _ and by denying air passenger payments to any community within 100 miles of an airport that does have service. That covered continental <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports; <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would not be affected. `` These criteria are reasonable and fair to rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' argued Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that shaped the bill The new formula made it through the appropriations committee by only one vote. On the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor it was erased by a point of order, because appropriations bills are supposed to deal only in dollars, not in legislating rules for the programs involved. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said that without the restrictions, the program includes abuses that make it indefensible. So the debate is sure to come around again, in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and in final House action. `` Over 45 percent, or 50 of the 110 communities in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> currently receiving subsidies emplane less than 5 passengers a day under this program,'' said <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>. ``... Can anyone explain why the taxpayers should be paying $ 245,000 a year to fly planes into <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, to haul an average of 0.6 passengers a day ... Or can anyone justify paying $ 270,000 per year to fly planes into <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to haul 0.9 passengers a day, especially when another airport is 35 miles away?'' But Rep. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Neb., said the appropriation cut is devastating to a program that already has been reformed She said earlier legislation `` eliminated the worse abuses'' by instituting a subsidy limit of $ 300 a passenger. Then she offered some numbers that may be even more telling: 39 states have communities getting <ORGANIZATION> Essential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> subsidies, and there are 68 congressional districts involved. Eleven cities and towns in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> are among them, and Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she wants her constituents `` and all rural taxpayers'' to know she is n't surrendering but will work to get the money restored. She said it would take another $ 19 million or $ 20 million, which amounts to .02 percent of the total transportation appropriation, to finance the rural air service subsidies. `` ... <LOCATION> Rural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, home to more than one-fourth of the country's population, receives only $ 1 in federal mass transportation funds for every $ 28 in mass transportation funds spent in urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she added.

<HEAD>Student Rabbis Serve Isolated Congregations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When rabbinical student <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> began serving a small <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congregation at age 23, she felt handicapped by her youth and inexperience. `` A woman came to me for counseling about a career change,'' she recalled. `` I've never even had a full-time job! And this women is asking me for advice.'' But after two years of handling Sabbath services, funerals, bar mitzvahs and assorted life crises, <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> is accustomed to her role as spiritual _ albeit youthful _ leader of her <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrington </LOCATION> flock. She is one of 90 rabbis-in-training from <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College-Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> who spend one or two weekends a month serving small Jewish communities around the nation. The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> school for rabbis from the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has campuses in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Aside from on-the-job training, the student pulpit program gives the novice rabbis `` a sense of service to the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> movement. In some of these places, our students are keeping these congregations alive,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, dean of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campus. The 35-family Congregation Gates of Prayer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, has been using <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> students since the 1940s. `` It's good for us and it's good for them,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahasky </PERSON>, congregation president. `` We give them all the consideration of a fully ordained rabbi. If we need counseling, a bar or bat mitzvah or the naming of a new baby, they're our rabbi.'' Many of the congregations that use student rabbis are too remote or too poor to attract full-time rabbis, who can earn $ 45,000 and up. The students are a bargain at $ 9,000, plus transportation and lodging. Some congregations even save on hotels by putting students up in private homes, an arrangement that lacks privacy but creates strong bonds. `` They want to talk to me about everything Jewish that they've ever heard of, and I want to be there for them,'' said <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, whose stays in congregants' homes have also included non-spiritual pursuits like helping out with gardening and teaching kids to play knock-hockey `` The old people think of me almost as a granddaughter,'' she said. `` The other side of it is I have a great connection with all the kids.'' Working in areas away from cities where Yiddish expressions and Jewish food are part of mainstream culture also gives the students `` a different perspective on Jewish communities and their needs,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who was ordained as a rabbi in June after serving the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> congregation, said `` getting to know Jews of the South'' was one of the best aspects of his <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> stint. `` They're not a part of a majority Jewish culture at all,'' he said. `` It's not like being in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They put a lot of effort into their community because they ca n't rely on big Jewish organizations'' to keep the religion alive. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaktman </PERSON>, 27, who served a Jupiter, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, congregation, agreed. `` One of the frustrations of the rabbinate in general is working with people who are apathetic and jaded,'' he said. `` One of the ironies of these pulpits is that even though they're often small, they really feel a certain mission about maintaining their religion.'' Assisting that mission can seem like an awesome responsibility. `` I'm the rabbi for a 25-mile radius and I'm not even a rabbi,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON>, 28, who served a 72-family congregation in <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` They're coming to me, expecting me to be the voice of knowledge and wisdom, when I have to learn from them and all of their traditions.'' <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> says he `` fudged'' his first funeral, `` probably very badly. The blessing of never having a death in my family, probably was a curse.'' He added, grinning: `` Then I had to do four funerals in one month. Now I know how to do it inside out.''

The manifesto, appproved near the close of the 10-day congress July 20, added, `` We wish to be sensitive to those of other faiths, and we reject any approach that seeks to force conversion on them.'' Repentance was expressed for past `` attitudes of ignorance, arrogance, disrespect and even hostility'' toward those of other faiths. But the manifesto rejects `` both the relativism that regards all religions and spiritualities as equally valid approaches to God and the syncretism that tries to mix faith in Christ with other faiths.'' Asserting the `` uniqueness of Christ,'' the manifesto says, `` There is only one Gospel because there is only one <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, who because of his death and resurrection is himself the only way to salvation.''

 Playwright <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says tickling the funny bone is a better way to reflect reality than drama. `` I do n't think about what I'm trying to reflect of the human condition,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who is honored on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` American Masters'' next Monday. `` I've found that comedy is the best way for me to reflect my own feelings. I think comedy can be more realistic than drama. But I do like the mixture of comedy and drama in a play.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the author of 25 plays, is perhaps the world's most successful playwright. Only one play, `` Actors and Actresses,'' was scrubbed in tryouts before it reached <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Many of them have been made into motion pictures, in addition to the stories he's written directly for the screen `` <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>: Not Just for Laughs'' examines his style of humor and offers a portrait of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> through interviews with actors, directors and producers and a conversation with the playwright. The program includes excerpts from the film versions of such plays as `` Barefoot in the Park,'' `` The Odd Couple,'' `` Plaza Suite,'' `` Chapter Two'' and `` The Sunshine Boys.'' The cameras followed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for five or six months: to a tribute to the playwright at the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>; to a comedy class he taught with his brother, writer <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>; and to theaters where he put together his latest play, `` Rumors.'' Many of his plays are inspired by aspects of his own life. Three plays, `` <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Memoirs,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Biloxi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Broadway Bound'' tell of an aspiring young playwright named <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>. `` Some plays deal with myself, some deal with friends of mine and some are just picked out of the air,'' he said. `` My plays are never autobiographical; otherwise, I would call the characters <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. They're fictionalized experiences you remember. `` <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> is essentially <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Essentially, yes. There is a catharsis in this. You do n't go into it without purpose. I think the most cathartic one was ` Broadway Bound.' It dealt with my relationship with my family in a more traumatic period. ` <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memoirs </ORGANIZATION>' was a sort of idealized version of that family life.'' His current play on Broadway, `` Rumors,'' is a farce and fast-paced comedy he wrote as a change of pace. Next up is `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>'s Women,'' which he said is a mixture of comedy and drama He also has written two movies for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Marrying Man'' and `` Heaven on Earth.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is a graduate of <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s 1950s television show, `` Your Show of Shows,'' a phenomenal breeding ground for comedy that also produced such writers as <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Afterward, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also wrote for `` Caesar's Hour.'' `` I was so lucky to be able to work at that time with the best performers and the best comedy writers,'' he said. `` That's what you go to college for and I was getting paid for it.'' Despite his success, or perhaps because of it, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has rarely been taken seriously by the critics. `` I think by and large I've had my fair shake from the critics,'' he said. `` You have to view it as a total. I think the very fact that they're doing a program about me indicates somebody is taking me seriously. When I say the critics are fair with me that includes the negative reviews because sometimes I agree with them.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1975, and since that time all of his plays except `` Broadway Bound'' have opened on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> before going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> audiences are more polite and generally arrive on time. `` I have an apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and do move back and forth,'' he said, `` but you reach a point in your life when you do n't need the energy of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to write. You take it with you in your head. I've never lost that sense of desire to write. If anything, out here it's increased.''

<HEAD>American Express Gives Western Union Run For Its Money</HEAD>

 A college student telephones his parents for cash to cover an overdrawn check. A friend arrested in the dead of night calls for help in scraping up bail money. Within minutes, if you're willing to pay the price, you can wire financial aid just as corporate dealmakers routinely transfer billions of dollars halfway around the world. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> remains the solid leader in this growing consumer money-transfer business, although rivals are giving it a run for the money. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, introduced its <ORGANIZATION> MoneyGram </ORGANIZATION> service about 1 -LCB- years ago. Smaller companies serve specific regions or groups ranging from gamblers to truckers. Commercial banks also wire money, and even the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is considering a high-speed money order service. `` It's the whole idea of speed. Consumers rely more and more on getting things done faster,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Giesen </PERSON>, a vice president of marketing at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` The consumer market has yet to be fully tapped.'' Trying to do just that, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> just began its first advertising blitz for the service recently. Like the company's pitch for traveler's checks, the <ORGANIZATION> Moneygram </ORGANIZATION> ads appeal to people's fears. One shows a broke American teen stranded on the steps of a European church on a cold, stormy night. Another shows an elderly couple evidently distraught over an unexpected financial hardship. A third shows a mother and daughter stuck at a remote bus station. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in the money-transfer business since 1871, is countering with a beefed-up ad campaign that includes a TV spot showing a succession of mothers complaining about their children's spending habits. The light-hearted ad includes a new toll-free number for sending money by phone. All that competition could spell good news for harried, bargain-hunting consumers who need to send or receive cash fast. The cheapest and easiest way to gain access to emergency cash is through the bank automated teller machine network, where fees on transactions range from 10 cents to $ 3. Many are free. But one major problem with this system is that daily cash withdrawals usually are limited to $ 200 to $ 500. Another drawback is that not everyone has an automated bank card. `` There are still many households in this country that do n't even have checking accounts,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechtel </PERSON>. For them, the main way to send fast emergency cash, albeit expensive, is via the transmission service. Many <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> agents are open 24 hours; their telephone numbers are available in the Yellow Pages. Only Western Union allows customers to send money over the telephone, although it tacks on an extra finance charge. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> says it has no finance charge, but all transactions must be done in person. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has a computerized network of 13,500 agents nationwide, including many all-night convenience stores, supermarkets, hardware stores and hotels. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> has nearly 7,000 agents. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says it wired around $ 3 billion last year, with the average transaction at $ 300. American Express does n't release these figures but says its volume has risen steadily. Both companies promise money will be available domestically at the receiving agent within 15 minutes. <ORGANIZATION> MoneyGram </ORGANIZATION>, however, claims to offer more flexibility about where the money can be picked up. For these conveniences you must pay the price. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> have graduated fee scales, where the more you send the less you pay percentage-wise. But be careful: In some cases if you send a penny over the limit you'll end up in the next bracket and pay a substantialy higher fee. For instance, it costs $ 12 to send up to $ 50 via <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, or 24 percent of the principal amount. The fee rises to $ 14 for sending $ 50.01 to $ 100; to $ 21 for $ 101.01 to $ 200; and to $ 27 for $ 300.01 to $ 400. The fee levels off at $ 3,000, costing $ 105, or 3.5 percent of the principal amount. Above that each additional $ 500 or fraction thereof costs $ 20. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says it does n't limit the amount of money that can be sent. For the <ORGANIZATION> MoneyGram </ORGANIZATION> service, fees range from $ 9 for sending up to $ 50, or 18 percent of the principal amount, to $ 330 for sending a maximum $ 10,000. Wiring money from bank to bank is often much cheaper, with the sending bank charging from $ 10 to $ 20, but this service is only available during banking hours. All fees are higher when wiring money internationally. It also takes longer and the pickup spots are more limited. At <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which is working to broaden its overseas network, it can take up to two days. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> says it can deliver in a matter of hours but only with traveler's checks.

<HEAD>Stocks Vs. Gambling: The Long-Term View</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> becomes more involved in betting, sweepstakes, lotteries and the like, participation in the stock market shrinks. It is a sign of the times. Make of it what you will. In gambling, the odds are overwhelmingly against you. In stocks, chosen wisely and held for the long term, the chances of winning rather than losing are heavily in your favor. It has been demonstrated again and again. Nevertheless, the stock market becomes increasingly unpopular, even as it makes more headlines. Based on the publicity, or notoriety, many people tend to think of themselves as the only ones not in the market. It is n't so. Since 1968, households have been net sellers of stock in all but one year. In that time the percentage of household financial assets held as stocks has fallen to 19.6 percent from 43.4 percent. Those are Federal Reserve figures. Why this should be so is n't clear, but the media's focus on spectacular, day-to-day price movements, rather than long-term results, has been cited. Some critics blame the brokerage industry, saying it fails to inspire trust. Many say the industry, including stock exchanges, has done a woeful selling job. Whatever the reason, a view of the equity market is that of a game people play, a trading game, a game in which money is made on tips, a game whose goal is outwitting the system for quick profits _ none of which involves investing. But as an investment vehicle, one in which millions of people have their choice of thousands of quality companies, the stock market has no equal. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>, which handles a $ 4 billion investment portfolio, concedes that the market can throw an investor for a short-term loss, but asks that they consider the long-term results. Over the past 15 years, he observes, equities have fluctuated, quivered and suffered, but when all was said and done a $ 1,000 investment made at the start of 1974 might have compounded to a total of $ 5,622 by the end of 1988. That total would have been achieved by a theoretical investment in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, which reflects a spectrum of the market that involves good performers and poor ones. Smart investors might have done better. What <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and others with the long-term view try to pound home is that results take time _ and compounding. Over relatively short periods of time the market rises and falls. In the long run, almost without exception, it rises. To emphasize that point, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> took perhaps the worst stock market period of all time, a 15-year span that encompassed the Great Depression of the 1930s. If you had invested $ 1,000 a year beginning in 1926 and continued the program through the grim days of stock market collapse and depression, your equity account would have grown to $ 19,700 by the end of 1940. If that does n't sound impressive you might consider that thousands of businesses collapsed during that time, unemployment rose to 25 percent, the economy shrank and fortunes were lost. Still not impressed? Then consider that during that time consumer prices actually declined more than 2 percent a year, meaning those dollars grew in purchasing power. Most people lost purchasing power in the Depression; many stock market investors gained power. Sure the market strikes out. Babe <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> did too. He hit only 714 home runs but he struck out 1,330 times. Says Tate: `` More Americans should come to recognize the quality of the stock market's longer term slugging percentage and quit being so focused on the occasional dramatic strikeout.'' It would be nice, he said, to see individuals begin to act less recklessly with their savings and put more of their long-term investment dollars into equities. Stocks beat most other forms of investment, including most bonds, he says. As for stocks vs. gambling, you can not even quote odds. It's no contest.

 For his part, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said in an interview that he believes morale is better than it was when he took over. But he added, `` There is a concern that we have people in an acting capacity, because it suggests that a lot of change that might otherwise occur ca n't occur. There is frustration among some staff people. It's in everyone's interest that the matter be resolved.'' Supporters of <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, speaking anonymously, maintain that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may favor <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a longtime political supporter and campaign activist for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, some advisers in the White House dislike <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s outspokeness on safety issues. These sources maintain that there has been extensive industry lobbying to keep <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, a former public relations vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, as chairman. Neither <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> has made any secret about wanting the charmanship. Some <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff members praise <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> as personable and competent. Private air safety consultant <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, once the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s director of accident investigtions, describes the acting chairman as a `` fine individual'' who recognizes his limitations. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, discussing the agency's woes, points to its tight $ 25.4 million budget and to staff and leadership problems that have plagued the board since it was separated from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. While the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has no regulatory power of its own, it is the government's primary accident investigation agency and makes recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, other agencies and transportation industries. Board members individually lead staff members in top investigations and then, in public sessions, vote on the probable cause and safety recommendations. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> have sharply different styles and are often at odds on safety issues. The former chairman is sometimes the only dissenter on the board; the acting chairman has been low key, rarely taking strong positions in open meetings. The other three <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> board members, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, have had no public comments on the standoff between <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. `` They're kind of hunkering down,'' said one source who has been keeping a close watch on the agency. Critics of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s recent actions, or lack of them, cite several incidents as evidence of problems: _ The board failed to investigate the complaint this spring of 60 air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> who signed a petition citing high-altitude `` air traffic chaos'' and calling for steps to alleviate the `` hazardous environment. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the acting managing director, headed off the petition before it reached the board, contending it would be a bad precedent to investigate what might be a labor-management problem. _ <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> was the board member assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill but did not go to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to head the investigation <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> answered that charge be saying that he has been very active in the inquiry and that he decided not to go because other high government officials were going and he did not see the need for `` sending another big name to the scene.'' _ While imposing a hiring freeze to meet its budget, the board held a meeting for top personnel in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the acting chairman made two official trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> meeting provided important dialogue with industry representatives and that the board had gotten `` a good deal'' on hotel accommodations and other expenses. He said both European trips were worthwhile and part of his official duties.

 A quarter-century ago, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> called the oppression of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women `` the problem that has no name.'' But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today has a name for <PERSON> Meiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON>'s problem: She's `` leftover Christmas cake.'' Miss <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON>, in other words, has grown a bit stale as a marriageable commodity _ at least that's what her mother complains. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where many marriages are still arranged, a woman is considered to have a shelf life of about 25 years. When <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON> was 28, she left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ alone. <PERSON> Sumiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morikawa </PERSON> sits next to the `` No Smoking'' sign in her <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> office and lights a cigarette. At 39, she says she's looking for a new man She is n't particular about his background _ as long as he is n't Japanese. `` Japanese men and women, they can not understand how to love,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Morikawa </PERSON>, the owner of a translating service. Three years ago, she ended a 16-year marriage undertaken to please her tradition-minded brother in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. No passion, she says. `` Japanese businessmen are very nice, but they are so totally quality-controlled. They see themselves as company men. And their wives also, they say, ` I'm a <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> wife.' It kills the individuality of people.'' It is 11:30 a.m. <PERSON> Renko </PERSON> <PERSON> Isowa </PERSON>, 42, pauses over a dish of vanilla ice cream as she cheerily recalls the strict training of her youth in the traditional female skills. `` I learned flower arrangement, tea ceremony and cooking for two years. I was totally dead,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Isowa </PERSON>, vice president of a television production company here. `` I wanted to start working. I wanted to be a member of real society.'' Twenty-six years after `` The Feminine Mystique,'' <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON>'s manifesto of women's rights, helped kindle feminism in the West, only a trickle of women in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are able or willing to live out its creed But many of those few come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to try. The three expatriates above may seem refreshingly liberated, but in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> many would consider them wild-eyed radicals. They insist on standing out in a society where wa, or group harmony, dictates `` the nail that stands out is hammered down.'' `` Japanese women have n't been raised to have aspirations,'' says <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, author of `` A Half-Step Behind: Japanese Women of the'80s.'' `` They're still facing boundaries we broke through 20 years ago.'' `` To be good American, you have to be an individual. To be a good Japanese, you'd better damn sight not be,'' says <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Fochios </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> psychiatrist who counsels many <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women. `` The women who ... come to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, then get into the machinery of the country, are able to enjoy the kinds of freedoms they had never dreamed of,'' he says. `` And these women are tough. They are tough.'' Miss <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON>'s family frets, to no avail. To her friends, she is an `` incredible oyahuko,'' a bad daughter. A few years ago, she moved into her own apartment in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, watching defiantly as the social pressures that mold a Japanese woman's life _ a cycle of temporary employment, marriage and child-raising _ claimed her schoolmates one by one. Her old friends `` spoke to me as if they were accusing me, criticizing me very severely,'' recalls the lithe, long-haired Miss Marimo, a free-lance writer. `` I did n't care at all. I do n't want to be involved in housekeeping. I smiled a Japanese smile'' _ and left. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, disaffected minorities organize, as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women did in the 1970s. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, it has always been easier to jump ship than to rock the boat. Until recently. Today, the glacial rigidity of Japanese society _ `` otoko no shakai,'' the man's world _ shows signs of thawing after more than a century of uneasy integration with the West. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant corporations, facing chronic worker shortages as the economy surges, are beginning to open management jobs to women. Traditionally they are hired as tea-pouring `` office ladies'' while pursuing their real vocation: marriage. Japanese women are even making an impact on politics. A record 22 women won seats in the July 23 elections for Parliament's upper house. Female voters had been angered by allegations that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s just-departed prime minister, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, kept paid mistresses The election also showed, however, that much has not changed. Many of the victorious female parliamentary candidates had portrayed themselves not as feminists but as simple housewives immune from corruption. Indeed, apart from the odd individualist who ventures abroad to live, few <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women want change. `` If you go to a party here and introduce yourself as a housewife, people will think you're strange. But in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> it's OK. Being a housewife does n't bother <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women, because they have a social position,'' says <PERSON> Kako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON>, the executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper published for Japanese in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I think in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> you have no secure place for women,'' she says. `` Here there are opportunities for women, so if you do n't try anthing hard, then you feel guilty. ... But in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> there are no opportunities so there's no such struggle. It's easy.'' `` When I go to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women I see are very content-looking, very happy,'' says <PERSON> Naoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a researcher for <ORGANIZATION> Sunstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese company with offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. When I come back to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I notice the women look very unhappy, frustrated.'' While women in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are largely blocked from positions of power, they provide a vital temporary worker base that absorbs economic downturns, allowing large Japanese companies to maintain their much-vaunted `` lifetime employment system'' for permanent workers. In addition, they are the linchpin of an economic system that allows men to spend long hours working and, as is expected, socializing afterward. With the men otherwise occupied, women often control family purse strings, and so completely control their children's destinies that surveys have shown the central relationship in a Japanese man's life is not between him and his wife but between him and his mother. So strong is such patterning of Japanese women, in fact, that leaving it behind sometimes causes deep emotional problems for expatriates, who must spurn what they have been taught since childhood and embrace alien values. `` Some of them say they feel guilty about being free as an American,'' says <PERSON> Fochios </PERSON>, the psychiatrist. `` They feel inferior to a Japanese woman because they do n't have the capacity to be a good Japanese wife.'' Some expatriate women, however, simply decide to ignore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values. `` Japanese women are better off. I do n't think I would like to marry an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> man,'' says <PERSON> Kiyomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koizumi </PERSON>, a 65-year-old neurophysiologist who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1949 and married a Japanese. `` I always say my husband is like air _ you would miss it if it's not there, I ca n't live without it, but you do n't feel it An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> man might be around me too much.''

 `` Extinction is Forever'' is the motto at naturalist <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>. Its symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> that became extinct in the 1690s. It's goal is to keep more of the world's animals from becoming extinct. The zoo boasts the world's most comprehensive collection of endangered species. It protects animals by breeding them in captivity and returning their offspring to the wild. On 25 beautifully landscaped acres of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the main island of the English Channel archipelago, the zoo tries to recreate natural settings for its charges. The trust also trains interns from all over the world to promote animal survival in their own countries. `` We are not trying to maintain a living museum,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Allchurch </PERSON>, the zoo's general administrator. `` We have a job to do. If it happens that the public is interested in what we're doing, that's great.'' Founded in 1959, the zoo started out as a place where <PERSON> Durrell </PERSON> kept the animals he collected during his expeditions. Four years later, he formed the trust as a registered charity. `` The release of animals back into their natural habitat is the ultimate goal for each of the species that we so carefully nurture,'' <PERSON> Durrell </PERSON> has said. The white-bearded, 64-year-old Briton lives in <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augres </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> on the zoo grounds with his American wife <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> but was traveling and unavailable to talk about his project with a visiting reporter. His books have been published in 26 languages. The best known is `` My Family and Other Animals,'' about his childhood on the Greek island of <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION>. He also has produced numerous television documentaries about animals. He is the younger brother of the famed novelist <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrell </PERSON>, author of the `` Alexandria Quartet'' and other works. The zoo concentrates on six major geographical areas: northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, southeastern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Mascarene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. It works closely with governments, wildlife groups, and other zoos, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` If we did n't work with government support and blessing, we would n't achieve half of what we do,'' <PERSON> Allchurch </PERSON> said. The first animals that the zoo returned to a natural habitat were 14 pink pigeons that were placed in a botanical garden in the Mascarene island of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> in 1984. Three years later, the zoo placed pink pigeons in an area of native forest that had n't been inhabited by these birds for 10 years. To date, 19 have been returned to the wilderness, and, significantly, two have been born there. `` We do n't befriend, socialize, train or handle animals, to enhance their chance of surviving the wild, if they ever get there,'' <PERSON> Allchurch </PERSON> said. The zoo also sent Jamaican hutias, large brown rodents, back to their island and is returning kestrels to <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. `` A lot of rare animals are dull and brown. But two dull brown parents with a baby are very exciting,'' <PERSON> Allchurch </PERSON> said. The zoo also has been a partner in programs to return golden lion tamarins to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION> starlings to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and thick-billed parrots to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. In 1978, the trust established its training program, which has educated some 250 trainees from more than 40 countries. Many already have had veterinary training, and they spend two to four months at the zoo. `` You learn a lot. It's a great place here,'' said <PERSON> Susana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringenbach </PERSON>, a 27-year-old trainee from <LOCATION> Tlalpan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. ` You can learn to educate the children not to go out and hunt.'' She said she was inspired by <PERSON> Durrell </PERSON>'s books and is particularly interested in helping jaguars and spider monkeys. The trust has annual income of $ 2.2 million, 60 percent of it from entrance fees. About 340,000 people visited the zoo last year. The remainder of the financing comes from private donations. Along with its sister trusts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, it has 20,000 members.

 At 23, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> seems too young to call an album `` Real Life Story.'' But it's not so unusual when one realizes that the drummer has been playing with some of the giants in jazz since she was 10 years old, and her own life story already surpasses many twice her age. She's on hiatus from `` The Arsenio Hall Show,'' where she's been drummer in the band since the late-night talk fest first aired. She's busy touring the country to promote `` Real Life Story,'' her debut LP with a major label on Verve-Forecast Records. She composed all but two songs on the album, co-produced it with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and sings on three tracks. It would seem to be a high point in an already illustrious career. But for <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, it's simply a turning point, part of a grand plan in which she moves from jazz prodigy to mainstream star. `` When I was 11 or 12, one side of me wanted to be a great drummer and the other side wanted to be <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>,'' she said. Now, it appears, both dreams may be realized. A pretty, serene young woman, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> is modest, almost blase, about her impressive past. She grew up an only child in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a working-class city outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where her father, <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, a saxophonist, introduced her to the sax when she was 5 years old. `` I asked him if I could play,'' she said. Her decision to switch to drums at age 7 was borne of necessity. `` My teeth fell out,'' she explained during a recent interview in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. By the age of 10, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> had begun to sit in with visiting musicians such as <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rahsaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. That same year, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, impressed with her ability, took her to the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> Jazz Festival. She met drummer <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> there, who then accompanied her on the television show `` To Tell the Truth.'' Two years later, she was awarded a special scholarship to the <ORGANIZATION> Berklee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> after the school's director heard her play with <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. During her time at <LOCATION> Berklee </LOCATION>, she took courses in piano, drums and vibes, along with harmony and composition. In 1981 she recorded an album, `` TLC and Friends,'' with <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. During this period, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> began to shape her career, shifting from a classical tradition to one that would bring her eventual commercial success. `` When I was 14, I had the potential; I strived to be one of the greatest drummers, period,'' she said. `` But something happened between the time I was 14 and 19. I decided I wanted to be an artist _ a singer, writer, producer.'' She graduated from high school at 16, and in 1983, moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and played with a variety of musicians such as <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Getz </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Her career, she said, has always snowballed. `` In this business, you work whenever you can.'' While in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> began to tire of acoustic jazz and decided to move into more contemporary music. She started playing with <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorter </PERSON>, co-founder of Weather Report, and last year toured with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said she rarely got nervous playing with such established musicians. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are among the musicians on her new album. `` I usually put more pressure on myself than they did,'' she said. `` I remember <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> would say, ` It's only music, relax.' That changed my outlook.'' After five years she began to dislike <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and recently moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. She lives in the suburb of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>. It reminds her more of the suburban neighborhood where she grew up. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the transformation from journeyman jazz musician to budding star is in full swing. `` The Arsenio Hall Show'' brought her national celebrity. Her circle of friends include actresses <PERSON> Dawnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of `` A Different World'' and <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON> of `` Night Court.'' Her next album will be mostly vocals, and she plans to try some acting. `` I'm one of those people who likes excitement, a certain kind of edge,'' she said. `` I like that place in between being in control and being safe. I like to be daring and take chances.''

 Fifteen years ago, an adolescent's spinning head terrified movie audiences throughout the world, as the ghastly specter of possession chillingly chiseled its way through `` The Exorcist.'' Well brace yourselves, horror movie fans, `` The Exorcist: 1990'' is on its way. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON>, who wrote the original from his novel of the same name, has written this third sequel, based on his 1983 novel, `` Legion,'' and is directing. Although `` Legion'' does not concern possession, <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> has added an exorcism to his script. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinderman </PERSON>, the rumpled police detective who had a role in `` The Exorcist,'' investigates a series of ritualistic murders in `` The Exorcist: 1990.'' <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> shot on location this summer in the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> area, where he once went to school and where much of the original 1974 film was also made. `` I would like it to be thought as the one and only sequel to ` The Exorcist,''' he said. <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> held all sequel rights to the original but allowed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, which released the first movie starring <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, to do `` Exorcist II: The Heretic.'' The sequel was written by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodhart </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON> and was both a critical and commercial failure. <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> won an Academy Award for `` The Exorcist,'' which also received six Oscar nominations including best picture and director -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedkin </PERSON> -RRB-. Locations for the new movie have included Holy Trinity Church and the original <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which will again be a hospital in the movie, although it is now a dormitory for male and female <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> students. <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> says there will also be a scene on the long stairway where Father <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> <PERSON> Karras </PERSON> tumbled to his death in one of the most hair-raising scenes of the original. Members of the cast include <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viveca </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindfors </PERSON>, as well as <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> students making their debut as extras and former Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> in a cameo appearance as himself. `` I think the occult is playing a larger and larger role in American society,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told publicists for the film in a video interview. `` I think there are some things about it that are hokey, but there is a very real satanic worshiping group of people in this country, and I have been involved in public health issues that deal with that three times in eight years. `` I think <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> was right when he said that we do n't know everything in earth and heaven. I'd say we only have a very small smattering of what's really yet to be known.'' In the movie, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who left office in July, has coffee with a priest in The Tombs, a restaurant near the campus. The bearded pediatrician said his literary agent called him and said the filmmakers were `` looking for someone recognizable because they wanted to authenticate a shot to make it look like <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with real people.'' The shooting came during the break between spring and summer terms, so disruption on the university campus was held to a minimum, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittleder </PERSON> of the school's public information office. `` Basically, other than when they have some filming going on and people are requested not to go into that area because of the filming, life continues as usual,'' she said. On one recent afternoon, <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON>, wearing jeans, sneakers and a <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> baseball cap, filmed a scene in which <PERSON> Lindfors </PERSON>, in a nurse's uniform, walks down the front steps of the hospital with a worn carpetbag in her hand. `` We want it to be an extaordinarily good film, and we want to scare the pants off the audience,'' he said. <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> thought the debacle of `` Exorcist II'' put a stigma on the current project. `` But if the film is good, it -LRB- the stigma -RRB- will vanish overnight,'' he said. The original `` Exorcist'' also received its share of brickbats from critics. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Illustrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It exploits the subject of diabolic possession without telling you anything about it.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, said, `` ` The Exorcist' makes no sense,'' although he conceded that `` if you want to be shaken, it will scare the hell out of you.'' Despite the mixed reviews, the film grossed a reported $ 160 million worldwide, a record at the time. The film told the story of a girl, played in both 1974 and 1977 by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who is possessed by the devil and causes several violent deaths. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, whose career plunged after the `` Exorcist'' movies, is not in the third film. Besides <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindfors </PERSON>, the cast also includes <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanders </PERSON> -LRB- `` St. Elsewhere'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON>. `` The story that I had constructed just did n't have any place for her,'' <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> said. `` Rather than taking a character I had to use and then trying to build a story around her, I thought the faithful thing to do was to create a great story and see who fits into it. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> did not, unfortunately.'' <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON> said the sequel will begin where `` The Exorcist'' ended and will follow the story of `` Legion'' except for `` a totally different ending.'' The story involves a friendship between a police lieutenant, played by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, and a priest, played by <PERSON> Flanders </PERSON>. `` There will be one, I hope breathaking moment at the end of the film, an effect that has never been seen before,'' the director said. `` I hope we can do it.'' But the film will not emphasize the spectacular special effects that helped make `` The Exorcist'' such a hit. `` This one does not rely upon spinning heads for shock,'' he said. `` The terror is in the shadows in the mind.'' `` There is almost no act of violence,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` I think it goes to a different level than your normal spooky picture.'' But do n't worry. It's going to be scary anyway, said <PERSON> Blatty </PERSON>. `` It is pure entertainment that uses theology only as it contributes to the excitement. `` I have independently counted 30 shocks, or little jumps out of the seat, some much higher than others.''

<HEAD>Noodles, Poetry and an Author Named Banana</HEAD>

 An author named Banana, a sentimental vignette about a bowl of noodles and a slim volume of poems that infuses an ancient form with a dash of Americana have Japanese readers enthralled. With 99 percent literacy and a mostly youthful reading public that bought 1.6 billion books last year, popular novels and short story and poetry anthologies can reach sales levels of which American publishers only dream. And in what could be called <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s version of the American `` literary brat pack,'' a few youthful writers are dominating this country's best-seller lists. `` ` One Bowl of Soba' Has Whole Nation Buying, Crying'' screamed a recent headline in a Japanese newspaper about a short story that traces the struggles of a young widow to feed her two children. It depicts the three sharing one bowl of soba, or Japanese noodles, as a New Year celebration. For leaving Japanese readers sobbing in their soba, author <PERSON> Ryohei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuri </PERSON>'s work has prompted scant literary praise but drawn accolades from other quarters for reawakening a sense of compassion for the underdog in this affluent country. And for exposing spiritual poverty in contemporary <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the story has made Kuri a rich and celebrated man. A magazine containing his story sold out 600,000 copies almost instantly. A book of Kuri's stories, including `` Soba,'' scored third on a June list of national best sellers, and a movie deal is in the making. Rising literary star <PERSON> Banana </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshimoto </PERSON>, 25, wrote three of the top 10 works of fiction on the same list, including the novel `` Tsugumi,'' which has been the No. 1 best seller for several weeks, and `` Kitchen,'' her first novel. The self-named daughter of a Marxist literary critic won the prestigious Kaien prize in 1987 for `` Kitchen,'' a 68-page book dashed off in three months while <PERSON> Yoshimoto </PERSON> worked as a waitress. The young heroine of `` Kitchen'' finds sanctuary at night when she drags her mattress into her kitchen to be lulled to sleep by the hum of the refrigerator. Later, she wins a man's heart with a dish of fried pork and rice. Critic <PERSON> Shinichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, who chose <PERSON> Yoshimoto </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> Kaien </LOCATION> prize, wrote that the author broke new ground by `` totally ignoring traditional literary accomplishment and describing feelings and senses freely. `` I felt a new literature came from this defiant attitude of keeping these things on the page whether or not they fit the old rules of literature.'' Another young woman who recently shook the literary establishment is <PERSON> Machi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON>, a 27-year-old doe-eyed poet whose `` Salad Anniversary'' made publishing history by selling nearly 3 million copies _ more than any other book of modern poetry. She startled practitioners of the 1,300-year-old native art of tanka poetry by using contemporary language, including over 150 borrowed Western words such as <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION> and valentine. <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON> is credited with revitalizing the tanka, a five-line poem that follows a strict 5-7-5-7-7 syllable count. `` I am using short poems to write about the small emotional epiphanies we make every day that usually go unnoticed,'' she said. `` Many people write to tell me they saw their own feelings expressed in my poetry.'' <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON>'s American translator, <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, says that although `` Salad Anniversary'' suggests <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickenson </PERSON> with touches of <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s humor, many Japanese critics have faulted her poetry as slight. The book will be published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in January by <ORGANIZATION> Kodansha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Perhaps the biggest sensation in Japanese publishing in recent years is <PERSON> Haruki </PERSON> <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON>'s novel, `` Norwegian Wood,'' whose title is taken from the Beatles song The book, published in two volumes by <ORGANIZATION> Kodansha </ORGANIZATION>, has sold more than 4 million copies since its release in 1987, and spent 21 months on best-seller lists. `` Norwegian Wood'' is a meandering tale of love and rootlessness among Japanese youth in the 1960s and'70s, and features a protagonist in his 20s who hangs out in coffee shops and jazz bars, reads `` The Great Gatsby'' and listens to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>. `` It's a kind of love story that Japanese have not been party to in the past in their popular literature,'' says Kodansha senior editor <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>. `` The characters flit in and out of meaningless relationships, but in the midst of all the wandering there is the will for affection.'' An earlier <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON> book, `` Wild Sheep Chase,'' will be published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kodansha </ORGANIZATION> in October. Many popular authors pump out 10 or more books a year to feed the appetite of a voracious reading public, and to keep the momentum going in what publisher <PERSON> Minato </PERSON> <PERSON> Asakawa </PERSON> calls the `` jitenshya sogyo,'' literally the `` bicycle operation.'' `` Japanese authors believe that when you stop peddling your bicycle will fall down. So to keep your life and career at the same pace you never stop peddling,'' said <PERSON> Asakawa </PERSON>, editorial director at <LOCATION> Kodansha </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Asakawa </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s literary `` brat pack'' can afford to pause on the literary treadmill because their works are selling in larger numbers than ever before.

<HEAD>Catholic Tactics On Abortion Adjusted After Court Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops see traces of anti-Catholicism and attempts to shut them up in opposing abortion. But they say they wo n't be stilled and are shaping new tactics in the struggle. They've put their present emphasis on short-term, partial measures, short of a total ban. The declaration by their anti-abortion committee came last week, laying out refashioned church strategies in light of the July 3 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision upholding some Missouri restrictions on abortion. The bishops saw `` cause for hope'' in the decision, saying it `` marks the begining of a new debate'' over the issue, but that conditions surrounding it remain confused and complicated. Some would `` exclude us'' from the debate, claiming `` our opposition to abortion is motivated soley by religious convictions,'' the bishops' committee said. But `` we do not intend to be ruled out of this or any social debate by spurious interpretations of the First Amendment. We must continue to speak for those who can not speak for themselves, our unborn sisters and brothers.'' Although not specifying who seeks to muzzle them, the bishops have been in a long legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobilization </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks removal of church tax exemption, alleging funding of anti-abortion political campaigns. `` We're not trying to silence anybody, although that's the impression the bishops try to give,'' said ARM's attorney, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Beil </PERSON>. `` Our suit is not to keep them quiet, but because they've violated the law by electioneering. However, he conceded the penalty sought _ lifting church tax exemption _ would, if imposed, would curb church anti-abortion activity. `` Further efforts would be limited,'' he said. With that lawsuit now tied up in a federal appeals court over whether <ORGANIZATION> ARM </ORGANIZATION> has standing to pursue it, the bishops sensed sharpened determination and feelings about abortion itself after the high court ruling. `` Anti-Catholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from the pro-abortion campaign, but abortion-rights advocates apparently seek to revivify it now that efforts of Catholics and other pro-life citizens have begun to bear fruit,'' the statement said. Again, the bishops did n't pinpoint any evidence of anti-Catholicism. But on that matter, <PERSON> Biel </PERSON> said `` we've worked very hard to remove any trace of anti-Catholicism'' from the suit. He said some plaintiffs were Catholics. The bishops' committee, in the remodeled planning, said the bishops seek `` protection for the unborn to the maximum degree possible, `` but short-term objectives were recommended as most feasible _ a pragmatism repudiated by conservative <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> critics. Although the bishops were early, key players in opposing abortion, the statement recognized that some Protestant denominations and others now were allies, and urged cooperation with them. Some want partial restrictions, not total. `` By working together with other concerned Americans we can bring about a change of heart and a change of policy in our society so that unborn children will enjoy the law's protection,'' the statement said. Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headed the bishops' committee that draw up the 2,000-word statement, called `` An Opportunity to Defend Life. Declaring that `` opportunities opened'' by the high court decision `` are limited and complex,'' the statement advocated legislative steps such as these: Limits on government funding of abortion, requirements of parental notification and consent on abortion for minors; safeguards against `` hasty or uninformed consent to abortion'' and restrictions on late-term abortions. Apparently because of past keen differences in <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> ranks over whether the church should press for partial or total restrictions on abortion, the bishops' committee urged a united front on practical possibilities, saying: `` Groups and individuals seeking new opportunities for protection of the unborn will best achieve their goal through mutual respect and cooperation. `` The movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its agenda; pro-life Americans must not give their adversaries an easy victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of political strategy.'' Urging that the tone be kept gentle and rational, the statement said: `` We must present reasons for our proposals which can be understood and appreciated by people of good will who may not share our convictions. `` Indeed we see respect for human life, born and unborn, as a demand which our common humanity makes on all of us, for other human goods lose their meaning when the value of life itself is demeaned or diminished.'' The statement said the `` humanity of the unborn child'' is being obscured by arguments over privacy and personal autonomy, adding that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> have just begun to see that a `` right to life'' precedes fetal viability. `` Prior to viability a child depends for survival on the protection of his or her mother's womb,'' the statement said. `` In other contexts, however, our society rightly sees dependency upon others as evidence of a need for more care and concern, not as a pretext for denying rights to the helpless.''

In a manifesto, the congress of about 4,000 evangelicals from around the globe declared: It `` would be a form of anti-Semitism, as well as being disloyal to Christ, to depart from the New Testament pattern of taking the Gospel to ` the Jew first.''' The manifesto, appproved near the close of the 10-day congress July 20, added, `` We wish to be sensitive to those of other faiths, and we reject any approach that seeks to force conversion on them.'' Repentance was expressed for past `` attitudes of ignorance, arrogance, disrespect and even hostility'' toward those of other faiths. But the manifesto rejects `` both the relativism that regards all religions and spiritualities as equally valid approaches to God and the syncretism that tries to mix faith in Christ with other faiths.'' Asserting the `` uniqueness of Christ,'' the manifesto says, `` There is only one Gospel because there is only one <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, who because of his death and resurrection is himself the only way to salvation.''

<TEXT>
 When he was young, <PERSON> Gendengun </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> would start his day galloping on horseback over the vast plains of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. These days, he starts his day poring over the real estate ads in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>'s first ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is looking for an embassy building and residence befitting his ancient nation, which gave rise to the 13th century warrior <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. His country, sandwiched between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has been synonymous with remoteness and isolation for hundreds of years. No more. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> is making its debut on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s diplomatic stage with an ambassador who is not your typical, `` stiff upper lip'' diplomat. When he went to present his credentials to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> three months ago, <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> took along his infant grandson. He and his wife care for the baby, `` and there was nowhere to leave him,'' <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> said in an interview. He drives his own car _ a chauffeur is not in the budget yet _ and lives in a <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoque </ORGANIZATION> apartment house that has seen better days. His deputy lives in an adjacent apartment, and the living quarters are also used as offices. But <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> is sufficiently savvy to have learned one of the first rules of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> success: a lobbyist is a virtual must. He has retained the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kloberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> to help him get settled, introduce him around town and promote investment in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. His English has the distinct rolling intonation of a Russian accent, the legacy of five years of university in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where he studied international law. The subject of his doctoral desertation was one he knows well: landlocked countries. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, once the seat of a warrior empire that extended to the shores of the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, established diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. `` It was high time,'' <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> said in an interview. About 100 other countries have diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, which became the world's second communist nation when it declared independence in 1924, but only about 20 maintain resident ambassadors there. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, works at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and occasionally travels to visit several junior American diplomats who brave the harsh climate and lack of Western comforts to live and work in <LOCATION> Ulan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bator </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> and his five brothers and sisters grew up on a farm in the western part of the country, which spans an area the size of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but whose population is only 2 million. `` I miss the rural life,'' said the 55-year-old envoy. `` We had five treasures: horses, cattle, camels, sheep and goats.'' In those days, it was easy for a bright youth to get a high school and university education, he said. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> had styled itself on the Soviet model of centralized economic planning and a free education for all. Nowadays, with 70 percent of the population under the age of 30 and shrinking Soviet aid, competition for university slots is tougher, <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> has its version of perestroika and glasnost, the Soviet policies of economic restructuring and political openness, but in <LOCATION> Ulan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bator </LOCATION> it's called `` shinechel'' or renewal. `` You can say we have more freedom than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now,'' <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> said with a laugh. The opening to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> paralleled improving relations between <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and its giant neighbor to the south, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Relations between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ulan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bator </ORGANIZATION> were ruptured in the late 1950s when <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> sided with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in its split with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But the recent thaw in Sino-Soviet relations encompassed the Mongolians, as well. In 1984, <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> was part of a <ORGANIZATION> Mongolian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> team that drafted an agreement with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to start normalizing relations. Here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he meets with his Chinese counterpart as well as with Ambassador <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who is also in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> office. Nyamdoo would like more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of his country, specifically through a meeting between his foreign minister and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` The level of diplomatic relations is too low now,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials characterize the relationship as modest but off to a good start. Trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> runs at about $ 3 million annually, mostly Mongolian exports of cashmere and wool. Hundreds of American hunters go on safaris to hunt rams in the frozen wastelands of the <LOCATION> Gobi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. Nyamdoo would like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, possibly in the form of joint ventures. Already a team representing petroleum companies visited <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> this summer to examine the prospects for oil exploration in the mineral-rich country, he said. But for Nyamdoo, the most pressing need is an embassy building. His efforts are complicated by a standoff with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over land for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chancery in Ulan Bator. In accordance with diplomatic practice, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> can not set up an embassy here until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gets the land for its chancery in <LOCATION> Ulan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bator </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has picked out a lot used by a Mongolian naturalist society and refuses to settle for another space, <PERSON> Nyamdoo </PERSON> said. `` I am stubborn, too. We will see,'' he said.

<HEAD>High Rollers in Hog Country? Gambling Moves Into the Heartland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The mighty <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> once carried cargo and cotton and damsels and dandies up and down the lazy river. Now Iowans are betting these waters will deliver them another precious commodity _ greenbacks. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, known more for hogs than high rollers, is moving to revive riverboat gambling, hoping the romance of the past will generate riches for the future _ and it's not alone. Across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland, several states are planning or considering gambling ventures to try to bring dollars, jobs and tourists into struggling industrial cities and small towns hit hard this decade by factory closings, the farm depression and the exodus of jobs and people. `` If we were still doing well and had not turned into the great Rust Belt, you would not see this great influx of gambling in the guise of economic development,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a key supporter of riverboat gambling in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` It's a nice stopgap until we can readjust ourselves and get back on two solid feet.'' Soon there will be wagers in the land of Wild <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>, the gold rush town of Deadwood, S.D. There's gambling talk, too, in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. That's not to suggest there are n't skeptics and critics. Some argue the stakes are too low to be an economic salvation, the sites too ho-hum or bleak for tourism. Others fear games of chance will erode the American Gothic ethic. `` When gambling comes in, all of the other social crimes increase,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Primavera </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION>. `` It increases loan sharking. It increases drug traffic ... -LRB- and -RRB- prostitution.'' Supporters insist they intend to create family entertainment. `` Those traditional <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> heartland values are ... still going to be there,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Davenport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The only change, proponents say, is the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> will being doing more to strut its stuff. `` The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is well known worldwide,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- It's -RRB- a gold mine in our backyard and we have n't taken advantage of it.'' `` It's all right to be homespun,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. `` That's part of the charm of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But it may be time we get a little more sophisticated.'' And gambling seems a logical step with the increasing popularity of bingo, lotteries and horse and dog tracks. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, for example, a record $ 205 million was wagered on games of chance last year, including pull tabs, blackjack and bingo. More than 30 states have lotteries and more than 40 have parimutuel betting, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> management and public administration professor and co-author of a book on casinos. There's more to come: _ In <LOCATION> Deadwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, there will be poker, blackjack and slot machines, probably in October. Voters this spring approved gambling. City proceeds will go to historic preservation in this once rip-roaring <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> town where <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>'s last poker game ended with a bullet in his head. `` What we're really doing is returning to our past and saying that's really our future,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, co-owner of a local hotel. _ In <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a struggling steel capital on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, voters will be asked in a non-binding November referendum whether they want resort hotels with casino gambling. Supporters of casino gambling in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, say they are not giving up despite failing to get enough signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. In 1988, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> rejected casinos for the third time in 12 years. _ In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, some lawmakers want to mimic <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and put riverboats and other floating casinos on parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and other waterways. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in June rejected such a plan but a task force has since been formed to study the issue so lawmakers can reconsider it in the fall. Many Illinois officials are eager to put paddlewheelers in the water before <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which does n't start riverboat gambling until April 1991. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> requires county referendums before gambling can begin in each local area. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> has proposed creating a regional agency to monitor riverboat gambling on the states' boundary waters. The lure of big tourist bucks is particularly appealing to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> towns in both states, which have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last decade. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has estimated gambling on its rivers and lakes could generate $ 1.7 billion in spinoffs from tourism and new business. There's concern, though, riverboats could cut into the bingo and racing profits. Further, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> said, `` At some point, you reach a saturation point. If <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has it, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> ... the impact of it for any individual state is going to be diluted.'' Some experts say <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s riverboat project already is in trouble because of a $ 5 limit per bet, $ 200 cap on nightly losses and 20 percent casino revenue tax that will make it harder to reap a profit. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> `` has produced an unworkable bill that will probably result in naught,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report. He added in a telephone interview: `` They're going to throw a party no one will go to.'' Especially, some say, if it's far away. `` People from around the country are not going to travel to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to spend $ 5 on riverboat gambling,'' said Professor <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` Everything that is good about it lends itself to being small ... -LRB- But -RRB- if it's small it's not going to add much to the economy.'' But local folks insist they're not expecting miracles. `` I do n't think anybody has touted riverboat gambling as the answer to their economic woes,'' <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said. `` It's like chicken soup. It ca n't hurt and it looks like it could help. ... It's just another piece of ammunition to lure people.'' That's also what Deadwood hopes to do. `` There's no other way we could think of to raise money,'' said <PERSON> Melodee </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, head of the Deadwood You Bet Committee. `` Deadwood is sitting 45 miles from a major airport, 15 miles from the interstate. No industry is going to come to Deadwood.'' But big cities that have industry and are looking for gambling to reverse their fortunes also face obstacles, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dombrink </PERSON>, associate social ecology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Irvine </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s co-author. `` It's kind of Pollyannish to think a blue-collar industrial city is somehow tailor-made for ... a tourist industry,'' he said. `` ` Tourism is not like a nose job, where one day you can wave a wand. ... It might take a long time for people's perceptions to change.'' But some in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, believe the scenic lakefront and proximity to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> will make the city an ideal casino site, despite its problems with shuttered stores, a bleak downtown and a shrinking workforce. `` I think it's <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s last shot at an economic development project that will deliver in the magnitude the steel mills once delivered on,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Earline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a supporter. `` Nothing else we've looked at will revitalize <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> in the same manner. If casino gambling ca n't do it, nothing can.''

 This town, population 945, will try for a riverboat gambling license. So will <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, with more than 60 times as many people. `` I think there's a possibility of us getting a license, but I think it's an uphill battle,'' said <ORGANIZATION> McGregor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahn </PERSON>. `` Personally speaking, I think it stinks.'' The northeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> communities, about 60 miles apart on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, are two of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> towns that plan to apply for licenses from the state <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> following approval of riverboat gambling in local referendums last week. There is no limit on the number of licenses that could be issued, but observers expect no more than three _ some say only one _ will be issued for the first year. On paper, <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> would appear to have an overwhelming edge. The city boasts many tourism attractions, highlighted by <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> boat tours and the first dog track granted a parimutuel license when gambling was legalized in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> four years ago. But <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> officials concede nothing. Their own attractions include a 970-acre park named for <PERSON> Zebulon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a series of 191 preserved prehistoric Indian burial grounds, and thousands of acres for hunting and camping. Officials felt confident enough of obtaining a riverboat gambling license to hire a contractor to build a boat dock for about $ 500,000. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> is a half-mile stretch of restaurants, antique shops, taverns and other stores nestled between forested bluffs overlooking the river. `` Being a smaller community, I think it's only fair that we should have an opportunity like this, rather than everything going to the big urban areas,'' said <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> City Clerk <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> has a different argument for the gaming commission. `` There is a point that's reached where there's too many people in too small a geographic region all trying to do the same thing. I think a full-fledged operation like we plan in <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> and a full-bore operation very close to us, such as <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, might be a little bit much,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Dubuque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the non-profit group seeking a license. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, also director of marketing and communications at <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greyhound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, said five dog tracks are due to open in neighboring <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, potentially cutting attendance and revenue in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` We're hoping to secure a riverboat gambling license to get a floating casino out on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> so we can have two major tourism draws that will allow us to bring back some of these people that we'll be losing to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.'' A floating casino could mean 300 jobs and an extra $ 100 million a year to the local economy, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. In <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, officials feel the state almost owes them a license to compensate for lost taxes on thousand of acres around town purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>'s never going to land the big industry, and the economics are such that we'll probably never see a dog track or horse track,'' Mayor <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON> said. `` We just never seem to get our fair share of what's going on.''

 The hot, crowded bus stopped at a dirt road. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, freshly deported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, stepped down and started walking the final, dusty mile to his parents' concrete-walled house. He did n't know how long it would be safe to stay. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 20, returned to civilian life this spring after four years in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s army. But the civil war followed him home, and guerrillas warned him to leave or his life would be in danger. `` I do n't know whether it is safe for me to return,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, looking at the mountain range just to the north, where combat recently had intensified between government troops and the leftist guerillas. `` I'll have to see how things are.'' The journey home is a familiar one lately in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Deportations of Salvadorans from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which increased dramatically after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crackdown designed to plug off a flood of Central Americans, totaled more than 1,100 in the first half of the year. On Feb. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> abruptly ended its policy of allowing Central Americans to travel beyond <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations for temporary residence. By January, new asylum applicants were pouring into southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at a rate of 500 a day. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> began ruling on applications the day they were filed. Those denied were held in detention camps until deportation. Only six Salvadorans were granted asylum in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from Feb. 21 to the end of July. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he did n't even bother to apply; people told him it would only mean longer detention before he was deported. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s homecoming prompted smiles from neighbors as he passed on a road lined with barbed wire and dotted with occasional piles of cattle dung. `` Todo tranquilo aqui -LRB- everything calm here -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilina </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> when he asked about any local fighting. Chickens scattered minutes later as he turned down a narrow path, stopped at a cinderblock house and shouted to a smiling woman who was hanging laundry on a rope. `` Hello. <PERSON> Lito </PERSON> is back, too,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lito </PERSON>'s mother. `` He will visit Sunday,'' after a reunion with his wife and newborn baby in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. <PERSON> Lito </PERSON>, his next-door neighbor and fellow ex-soldier, was deported on the same <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight that had carried <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> the day before. Out of work and threatened by the guerrillas, <PERSON> Lito </PERSON> had left for `` El Norte'' a few weeks before <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> made his trip in May. He and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> found each other at the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention camp northeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The food and the bed were better there -LRB- in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> detention -RRB- than I have at home, and it is air-conditioned,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` But I was a prisoner. It was my first time ever to be a prisoner.'' He left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on May 3 and slipped across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> on May 14. Four days later, he was in INS custody, having made the mistake of presenting himself to the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> to ask permission to stay and work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was held at the crowded <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention camp six weeks, wearing the standard orange jumpsuit and blue canvas slippers and playing soccer and basketball with other detainees. Many Salvadorans applying for asylum say they are fleeing `` la situacion'' _ a combination of civil war and unemployment exacerbated by war. The nine-year conflict has claimed 70,000 lives, mostly civilians, and displaced 500,000 to 1 million people. Those able to prove they are fleeing persecution get asylum and permission to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say most Central Americans come for economic reasons. Among Salvadorans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is not hard to find ex-soldiers who say they were threatened by guerillas. `` Immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has increased much by soldiers who have completed military service,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Segundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montes </PERSON>, a Jesuit priest and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` They do n't want to return to their houses or their towns because they are afraid.'' In conflict zones, guerillas might consider ex-soldiers, public officials and their families to be `` ears'' for the government and tell them to leave, <PERSON> Montes </PERSON> said. `` If they do not leave, there comes a time when they, as they say, ` bring them to justice.' They kill them,'' <PERSON> Montes </PERSON> said. That type of justice is still more typical of the army, he added, `` but the guerrillas, I believe, have increased a little this type of repression against the civilian population.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> spent a good part of the flight to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> quiet and absorbed in violent reports of the civil war in a Salvadoran newspaper left on the plane. He did not join in the idle clowning of some of the 59 Central American deportees taking up the rear half of the airliner, on seats for which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government paid $ 288 per one-way ticket. When he arrived at his rural home near the town of <LOCATION> Chapeltique </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorto </PERSON>, was cooking over a wood fire in the house's tiny, smoke-blackened kitchen. She stepped out to greet him with a grin of relief. `` Thank God, you returned,'' she said. `` It worries me when you are so far away.'' He took off his shirt and ate the small plate of eggs, rice and thick corn tortillas his mother served with a plastic tumbler of cool water from the well. His father, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, was bathing in the river down a hill behind the house. Towel slung over his shoulder, he returned as <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> ate and warmly greeted his son. The house has electricity but no running water. A tree trunk in the middle of the floor holds up a red clay roof. A hammock is the principal piece of furniture. On one concrete wall, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had written in chalk the date his son left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The father said things had been calm locally, but that the week before, in a battle 25 miles to the north, four of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>'s army buddies had been killed. The younger <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, stunned, pulled from a shelf a pile of photographs showing him in battle fatigues with two of the dead, drinking hot pepper sauce as part of `` toughness'' training. An hour later, several soldiers, fingers-on-triggers, marched by the house on patrol. The next morning, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he would try to get work at the jute farm where his father earns 10 colones -LRB- $ 2 -RRB- a day. `` If I had been able to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` I could have lived in a place with a bed and a mattress.'' Later, he added, `` Maybe I will return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Are 1990 Prices Scaring Buyers?</HEAD>

 A surge in early-August car and truck sales may be an indication that consumers are shying away from waiting for this fall's 1990 model cars and the higher prices they will be carrying. Figures released Tuesday by the eight major automakers with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants showed that car and truck sales during the Aug. 1-10 period rose 8.2 percent over the same period last year. Car sales were up 7.4 percent and truck sales rose 9.4 percent. Late 1989 model cars may be looking more attractive to consumers who have heard recent news of tentative price increases by the Big Three automakers ranging from 3.4 percent to 5 percent for 1990 models. The increased sales also may have been fueled by manufacturers' incentives, which have been around in some form since early April When asked if he thought some consumers planning to buy a 1990 car had decided to beat the price increases by purchasing a late 1989 model, analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said flatly, `` I hope so. `` I think in all probability there are people buying a little earlier than usual, but not many,'' said <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said that later this month and next month, as the 1989 model year draws to a close, more people may decide to buy now rather than wait for later. `` We have n't had any dealer advertisements yet saying ` Beat the price increase.' They should start soon,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its tentative prices will be about 3.4 percent above 1898 levels, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its prices will jump about 4.8 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 prices will be about 5 percent more than in 1989. The companies said some of the increases are due to governmental requirements that they install passive restraint systems _ air bags or automatic seat belts _ in 1990 model cars. `` Let's face it, the consumer wo n't pay for safety,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said. The wild card in late 1989 and early 1990 model year sales promises to be incentives. Automakers and some dealers would like to get rid of them, but consumers are used to being told how big a rebate they'll get if they drive away in a new car now. `` They -LRB- manufacturers -RRB- are filing for pretty big price increases,'' said analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But whether they will be real-world -LRB- prices -RRB- or just on paper to be superseded with rebates is a good question. `` I think they will wait for about 15 minutes, see that sales are slow and come out with rebates.'' The incentives are designed to give sales a boost, but they have n't done the kind of job this year as they have in the past. From Jan. 1 through Aug. 10, car and truck sales were 3.6 percent behind last year's pace, falling to an average daily rate of 38,063 from a rate of 39,500 in the year-ago period. Car sales were off 4.8 percent and truck sales were down 1.5 percent.

<HEAD>Video Retailer Challenges $100 Million Libel Award</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pitches cookware and jewelry to millions of TV viewers, but the video retailer's more important audience is a judge who will rule on its appeal of a $ 100 million libel award. The financially ailing company, which could be devastated by such a large forfeiture, is seeking to reverse or reduce the jury award granted <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. In an earlier lawsuit of its own, <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> had accused GTE of installing an inadequate telephone system at the retailer's <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> headquarters, which it blamed for missed calls from viewers and the loss of millions of dollars worth of sales But the case boomeranged on <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> successfully countersued, claiming that its reputation was smeared by <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s accusations, which it called false The <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> appeal awaiting state Circuit Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rives </PERSON> when he returns from vacation later this month alleges 336 faults in the six-week case, ranging from improper evidence to <PERSON> Rives </PERSON>' demeanor, described as grumpy. The Aug. 2 verdict `` was grossly excessive and was the product of prejudice, passion and gross confusion,'' said <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> in its appeal motions filed Monday. Much of the appeal focuses on <PERSON> Rives </PERSON>' decision to permit <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s libel counterclaim to be heard in the same trial as the $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> suit <PERSON> Rives </PERSON> also is accused of prejudicing jurors against <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> and its attorneys. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> declined to comment on the motions, but said the <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based telecommunications giant would answer the challenges in court. A hearing on the appeal before <PERSON> Rives </PERSON> has been set for Nov. 28. `` This promises to go on for months,'' said <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> spokewoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurado </PERSON>. `` We said all along we'll try to get this overturned.'' Nonetheless, some people familiar with the case speculate that <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> may be interested in settling the matter by working out a lower settlement with <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed it lost $ 500 million in sales when <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone system could not handle an increasing volume of calls in 1986 and 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> executives also were accused of trying to hide the problem from <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, which now uses <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> telephones. `` GTE is in a very strong bargaining position,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stork </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> firm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is really not a large amount of money for a company like <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>. They might just make some sort of deal to end it.'' In closing trial arguments, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said the company only wanted to clear its name and did not want to devastate <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> with a huge award. `` I did n't come down here to look for money,'' he told the jury. The judgement, one of the highest ever awarded in a libel case, struck the 7-year-old video retail pioneer at a bad time. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> reported slumping sales and a $ 5.9 million loss for the quarter ended May 31. For all of 1988, the company reported a profit of $ 18 million on sales of $ 730 million. Its stock, which surged to $ 47 a share in mid-1987, bottomed out at $ 3 a share hours after the jury verdict. Meanwhile, two of <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s principal competitors plan to merge next month. CVN Cos. of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> QVC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, say their combined sales will knock <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> from the top spot in video retailing for the first time. Some legal experts said <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s best option is to aggressively appeal the libel ruling. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a libel-law specialist, said he believed the facts of the case did not support the huge award. `` If there is no evidence that <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> suffered damages as the result of the libel, it will be difficult for the damage verdict to be sustained because of its elephantine nature,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> noted that the award _ even if knocked down _ could encourge more companies to file libel suits in cases of rumors or common corporate bad-mouthing in the hope that other juries are equally generous. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> admitted its representatives circulated false stories claiming that international banker <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Safra </PERSON>, an Amex competitor, was tied to money laundering. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> opted for an $ 8 million settlement rather that risk a possible libel battle in court.

<HEAD>Integrated To Sell Financial Services, Restructure Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the struggling financial concern, plans to sell its core assets in another restructuring effort to emerge from under a $ 1.75 billion mountain of debt. Integrated said Tuesday it was trying to sell key subsidiaries including its two life insurance companies, its investment products distributor and its asset management business to prevent the spread of its financial woes. `` We recognized that if we do n't do something to take the insurance companies and some of the other companies away from the problems of the parent company, we were going to have more deteriorations,'' Integrated's co-chief executive, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, said in an interview. Integrated, which in June halted payments on the short-term portion of its debt, projected a $ 600 million loss for the quarter ended June 30 and said that sales of its investment products have declined and withdrawals have increased. The latest restructuring proposal was greeted with no enthusiasm on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where Integrated stock lost 75 cents to close at $ 2 and some of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm's bonds fell sharply in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lowered Integrated's credit rating Tuesday, citing the second-quarter loss forecast and the firm's announcement that it would not be able to pay interest on 12 \ percent notes due Aug. S & amp; P also cast doubt on the new plan, saying that `` significant uncertainty exists with regard to the success of any restructuring plan.'' Some bondholders said the firm's reduced asset base after the subsidiary sales would lower its earnings ability. Integrated said it valued the financial services companies at $ 450 million to $ 525 million and that sale proceeds would be used to meet obligations to senior debt holders. It said the firm's total assets were worth $ 1.17 billion to $ 1.25 billion, compared with $ 1.75 billion in total debt. The latest restructuring replaces one announced in late June that included $ 300 million in financing from its long-time adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Integrated officials met with bondholders Tuesday to discuss the latest plan, which emerged after the firm decided it could n't support the debt level in the first refinancing Integrated's June default on $ 955 million in short-term commercial paper capped a steady demise for the once high-flying real estate and insurance concern, whose stock nosedived from much as $ 40 a share in 1986 and $ 16 a share in late May. After the spinoff of subsidiaries, Integrated's main businesses would be managementof existing public and private limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts. It says it wo n't sell any new products until at least next year Integrated's other co-chief executive, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinroth </PERSON>, on Monday took a leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, where he is managing director of corporate finance. <PERSON> Weinroth </PERSON> has been on Integrated's board since 1983 and was elected chairman Aug. 1 and co-chief executive Saturday Integrated said that if the sale of the subsidiaries falls through it will spin them off to its senior debt holders. The subsidiaries are <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, its principal investment products distributor; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and Financial Clearing Services.

<BYLINE>Choice Of Airline Sometimes Comes Down to Peanuts</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite the fare wars and safety fears, sometimes choosing which airline to fly boils down to the peanuts. Airline officials say amenities ranging from snack packs to full cans of soft drink are a top priority even in this age of cut-rate tickets and scaled-back service. `` If we ever run out of peanuts, they -LRB- passengers -RRB- are quite perturbed,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They expect a little munchie with their flight.'' And if the munchies run short? `` If they're very mad, the flight attendant may ask another passenger to voluntarily give their peanuts up,'' Ms. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. Although airline advertisements in this age of deregulation focus on low fares and convenient schedules, most fliers still apparently expect to get their freebies, which of course are not really free. Most amenities are built into the cost of a ticket. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Washington-based airline industry organization <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers expect to spend about $ 2 billion this year on food service. He said he was unsure how that would be divided between snacks and meals. The importance of snacks, drinks, magazines, toiletry kits and toy captain's wings for the kids was underscored earlier this month in the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> merger with <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> traditionally served passengers a full can of soda, while <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> provided only a cup of the drink. The merged airline decided to adopt the full-can practice to avoid miffed passengers. `` Let me put it this way,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colodny </PERSON>, chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There will be no complaints on the Coca-Cola service.'' <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> said complimentary service dates to the beginning of the commercial airline industry, when carriers would fill seats with their own employees to reduce anxiety among passengers afraid of the then-new form of travel. `` In the early days there was widespread fear of flying,'' <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> said. `` All kinds of inducements were offered.'' <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> said efforts to comfort passengers evolved into free snacks and cocktails and hit its heyday in the 1970s, when airline regulation standardized fares and the companies had to provide something to distinguish their service. Those were the days of piano bars, complimentary champagne and platters of roast beef sliced at your seat. <PERSON> Jackman </PERSON> said one airline hired an aerobics instructor to demonstrate exercises in the aisle. `` In the days prior to deregulation, when everything -LRB- fares -RRB- was the same, you had to differentiate by on-board service. They'd go to great lengths to describe their food,'' he said. One of the best-known children of deregulation that tried to make it without freebies, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, failed after a few years. In-flight goodies vary among airlines and are more extensive as the passenger class rises. The most common items are soft drinks and peanuts. Pan American's business class passengers get a mixed snack pack including nuts, pretzels and sesame sticks instead of just peanuts, said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They also receive complimentary cocktails or wine and an `` amenities kit,'' containing toothpaste, hand lotion and other toiletries. On dinner flights, frequent fliers get to choose meals from a menu of about nine items, Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. `` Certainly, in first class or business class that does make a difference,'' she said of the complimentary items. `` I think it's part of the decision -LRB- of which airline to fly -RRB-. Advances in technology and changing social customs also have influenced airline handouts. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, said many airlines used to distribute complimentary mini-packs of cigarettes and matches to passengers. That stopped when smoking became less acceptable. In the old days before cabins were pressurized, the airlines gave passengers a stick of chewing gum to help equalize the pressure in their ears. Those seemingly little things make a strong impression on consumers, said <PERSON> Naresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Malhotra </PERSON>, professor and coordinator of marketing and management science at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The consumer is buying a bundle of benefits, rather than just the basic transportation,'' <PERSON> Malhotra </PERSON> said. `` There's symbolic value, in that the consumer feels he's being treated in the right manner. And, on longer flights, it becomes necessary. You've got to have something to eat. You've got to have something to drink,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to market a lead-free gasoline for older cars and trucks that use leaded gas and said the new fuel could cut pollution from such vehicles by up to 15 percent. The gasoline will go on sale next month at 750 Arco stations in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for about the same price as leaded regular gasoline, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The announcement came the same day the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> unanimously adopted a sweeping 20-year plan to clean <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s air, the nation's dirtiest. It will transform the way Californians work and play. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s new gasoline was created to reduce pollution caused by the estimated 1.2 million worst-polluting vehicles in the region _ cars made before 1975 and trucks built before 1980. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s refinery in <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> will produce the gasoline, which is called EC-1 for Emission Control-1 and cost about $ 20 million to develop. `` We're making this heavy investment because we believe the dominant fuel of the future will be gasoline, rather than the alternatives you've been hearing about,'' said <PERSON> Lodwrick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. Those alternatives include methanol and natural gas. `` What we hope to demonstrate today is that we can clean up gasoline,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The fuel has an octane level of 88 and contains methyl tertiary butyl ether, which <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> described as an oxygenated additive. `` The MTBE is what makes up for the loss of octane by eliminating the lead,'' he said. `` It's something that's on the market that was n't available a few years ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> officials said the fuel reduces chemical components that cause smog by about one-third, and benzene, a cancer-causing pollutant, by half. The fuel-sulfur content was reduced by 80 percent. `` We're pleased that <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> has taken the initiative in developing a new gasoline that is more environmentally acceptable and which reflects the direction of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s future regulation,'' said board Chairwoman <PERSON> Jananne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON>. The board Tuesday voted 8-0 to adopt the smog-control plan despite industry objections the plan will strangle the region's economy It will target emissions from everything from motor vehicles, factories and auto paint to dry cleaners, bakeries, aerosol cans and backyard grills. The plan embraces land-use planning, transportation programs and stricter industry standards. It was completed in March by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>. Regional air quality officials estimate that the plan will cost $ 2.6 billion a year. Business interests say annual costs will reach $ 12 billion. Enactment was hailed as a `` leap into a ` Brave New World''' by <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieder </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor on the nine-member air resources board. The plan was branded `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> justice'' by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, a developer leading a coalition of business and labor interests fighting to revise the plane. `` They're acting as their own judge, jury and executioner,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> is working on another blend that will be sold elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the company said. Arco stations are in five Western states: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. When asked if <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> was pushed, or jumped, to develop the alternative to leaded fuel, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said, `` A little of both ... but if there are cleaner fuels to be burned, we'll be producing those too.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has told its <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> members they have difficult choices ahead amid reports the union and the carrier are considering plans including an employee-owned stake in the company. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON> said in a letter to union members Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ which has received a $ 5.4 billion, $ 240-a-share takeover proposal from investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> _ undoubtedly will be bought out by somebody. `` In fact, whether you like it or not, you and all the other employees are going to help pay for it,'' <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON> said. `` The only choice is whether we buy it for someone else or ourselves.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots may have to `` act rapidly, decisively and conclusively to assure our survival and prosperity,'' noting acquisition by an outsider likely would mean a leveraged buyout that could saddle the company with loads of new debt. `` We must watch this situation very closely, insuring that we have all the information we need to make the difficult choices that are inevitable,'' <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock closed $ 4.25 lower at $ 254.25 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Several news reports indicated <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> officials met during the weekend to discuss a plans for either a management-employee buyout or recapitalization that would put a big enough block of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock in an employee stock ownership plan to help block any hostile takeover attempt. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment Tuesday on whether meetings were held during the weekend or on reports of the purported plans. `` There's nothing out there to make me feel tremendously uncomfortable,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the reported discussions on a buyout plan. `` We're sitting here watching it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union represents mechanics at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and other airlines. The third union representing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, did not return phone calls seeking comment. <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON> said in his letter that the level of contribution to any <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> plan by the pilots would depend on the number of employees and employee groups participating. `` Depending on the declared interest of the other employees, we may need a great level of participation or a slight level,'' his letter read. `` It would make good sense for you to be financially prepared for the worst.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying the company, and in 1987 proposed a $ 4.5 billion plan to buy the airline from its then-parent <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Last week <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said its advisers were being consulted about the Davis bid In addition to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has expressed interest in a possible merger with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said a deal involving <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management and its employees would eliminate fears in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> that the airline would be stripped of valuable assets, as might happen with a leveraged buyout. A leveraged buyout is an acquisition financed mainly by borrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. `` With that kind of plan, you would assure continuation of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> as a strong airline,'' he said, referring to a management-labor buyout. `` It would create labor peace, which would be pretty important in the future.''

 Gaming analysts believe <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will have to make a dramatic move to pull out of its financial slump. On Tuesday, one day after Resorts posted a large second-quarter loss, the conclusions were near unanimous: `` They have got to recapitalize in some way, shape or form,'' said <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a Los Angeles-based analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Horwath </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2 percent in July, but the factory operating rate remained flat, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said today in a report that indicated further easing of inflationary pressures. Factory use held steady at 83.6 percent last month after declining 0.3 percentage point in June, the central bank said. The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last December. Last month's operating rate was down from 83.7 percent a year earlier The closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of inflationary pressures. The central bank has been straddling a fine line of keeping interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. It began letting rates drop in June as inflation seemed to lessen. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index in July stood at 141.7 percent of its 1977 base, up from 141.4 percent in June. The 0.2 percent increase last month came after revised 0.1 percent drops in both May and June. Those were the first downturns since the index fell 0.2 percent in February, which had been the first drop in a year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of raw materials and continued strength in business equipment excluding autos. `` In contract, automoobile and truck production fell sharply, and output of construction supplies, on balance, remained weak,'' it said. Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent. Output was up 0.3 percent at mines and oil wells and 0.8 percent at utilities. The factory operating rate dipped 0.1 percentage point to 83.9 percent at manufacturing plants, down from June's revised 84 percent. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ fell 0.3 percentage point from 82.6 percent in June. The rate at factories producing nondurable goods rose to 86.2 percent, from 86.1 percent in June.

 The stock market opened broadly higher today, shaking off its latest doldrums. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 13.28 points to 2,701.06 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT. Advancing issues outpaced declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 647 issues up, 308 down and 500 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 24.89 million shares. Analysts said the market could break out of its recent sluggish mood after having digested interest-rate worries that helped depress bond prices lately. Wall Street analysts said earlier this week that the markets were adjusting to the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might not lower interest rates after government statistics in recent weeks showed a moderately expanding economy. `` The market looks like it wants to move ahead on a fairly broad front,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report this morning that new housing starts rose 0.8 percent last month had little impact on the market so far, traders said New homes and apartments were built in July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million units, up from 1.42 million units in June, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.65 to 192.73. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index had gained 1.06 to 380.88. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.86 points to finish at 2,687.78 in sluggish trading. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 809 issues up, 689 down and 501 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 148.77 million shares, up from 142.01 million in the previous session.

 <ORGANIZATION> K-H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it failed to meet the terms of the merger agreement it expected to complete next month with Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. K-H, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday it notified <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> a day earlier that it had not realized enough money from the July 14 sale of its trailer and maritime operations to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to meet the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> agreed in March to sell the operations to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 233 million. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> has 15 days to decide whether to go ahead with the merger, K-H spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> wrote Tuesday to K-H, estimating that K-H's shortfall was $ 25 million to $ 30 million and questioning how its earlier figure `` could be regarded even as a reasonable or good faith estimate.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> would continue studying the matter. `` That's really all we're going to say, what's in the letter,'' <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said today <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> changed its name Aug. 4 to <ORGANIZATION> K-H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, after the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> K-H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siefert </PERSON> said then the acquisition of K-H by <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> should be completed next month K-H said Tuesday the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> contributed to a $ 18.2 million loss in the second quarter. The company lost $ 10.8 million in the second quarter of 1988. The company said its revenue was $ 333.8 million for the quarter, up from $ 286.5 million in the year-earlier period. For the first six months of the year, K-H reported a loss of $ 259.9 million on revenue of $ 669.1 million, compared with a loss of $ 27.1 million on revenue of $ 549.4 million in the first half of 1988. K-H said $ 13.5 million of its $ 18.2 million second-quarter loss was attributable to sales of the trailer and maritime operations to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Fruehauf had battled heavy indebtedness and weak earnings since 1986 when its managers avoided a hostile takeover by acquiring control in a debt-financed buyout The sale of the truck-trailer and maritime operations to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> left <ORGANIZATION> Kelsey-Hayes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of aluminum wheels and anti-lock braking systems, as <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s major business. The trailer business continues as <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trailer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, while <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> changed its name to K-H.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to improve its servicing of planes at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport, a ministry official said The ministry urged <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to improve its maintenance because the airline's planes have been involved in many of the flight irregularities at <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> in recent months, the official said. `` A large number of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flights have had to return to the airport or be diverted because of technical problems, including engine malfunctions,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Northwest officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> could not be reached for comment immediately. At the airline's <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, headquarters, spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said officials there had not heard anything of the reported request and therefore could not comment in detail. <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said he was trying to reach <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but had been unsuccessful because it was late at night there. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> officials as saying <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> planes were involved in 16 of the 43 cases, or 38 percent, of flight irregularities at the airport so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the 16 Northwest irregularities this year included 12 in which planes were forced to return to <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> after takeoff and four in which planes were diverted, mainly because of engine problems. <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said he could not say if those numbers were correct. `` But we do have 22 departures a day from <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, so we're talking nearly 5,300 departures so far this year and it would be a fraction of a percentage -LRB- involving problems -RRB-, if those numbers are right,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> had five flight irregularities, the second largest number, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> quoted the officials as saying. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said he could not immediately confirm that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> had five flight irregularities this year at <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>.

 A new agreement has been reached between the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and its creditor banks, the second under the debt-reduction proposals of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, an international monetary source said today. The source said the accord would both reduce the country's $ 28 billion debt and add new loans to it. In last month's agreement on the $ 108 billion debt of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a choice was given to creditor banks: loan reductions, interest reductions or new loans. Whether <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s total debt will be larger or smaller remains to be worked out. The source said the new agreement was reached in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between representatives of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government and a committee of banks led by <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> last May offered the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> about $ 206 million in loans that the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could use for debt relief. In the present state of the market, the government can settle old loans for about 50 cents on the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the debt agreement, cited <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials and bankers saying they do n't consider the accord a break with the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan because it envisions that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will try to reduce its indebtedness. Additional money for debt relief is expected from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the fund's sister organization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The money could also be used to reduce interest rates on the old loans. The burden of interest payments is the heaviest part of the Third World's $ 1.3 trillion debt. Recent reports have said that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was less interested in reduction of its debts to the commercial banks, than in new loans from them. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> central bank, has been reported seeking $ 1.8 to $ 4 billion. Of the $ 28 billion the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> already owes, the bulk is held by governments and intergovernment bodies like the fund and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which have not permitted any reductions.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, trying to recover from a crippling strike and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, hopes to win back passengers by expanding its schedule and cutting fares. But a union leader said Tuesday the newly announced fare reductions by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors, including <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, would hurt <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to rebuild. The carrier on Tuesday increased from 350 to 390 its daily flights by adding 40 flights connecting <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and destinations mostly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and said it would fly 600 daily flights as of Sept. 7. Eastern's rebuilding plan calls for 800 daily flights by year's end, leaving the airline at about two-thirds its size before its machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked off the job and the carrier entered bankruptcy court proceedings in March Eastern also announced discounted fares beginning Sept. 7, including fares of $ 79 one-way between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and $ 129 one-way between <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The airline said the fares have fewer restrictions than the reduced fares announced this week by other major carriers and allow full refunds on unused tickets. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing, said the airline already planned new discounts before the other carriers and that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fall promotion offers tickets that `` are much easier to use and a much better value in most cases.'' Eastern will require three - to-seven-day advance purchase and its rates are available nearly every day and carry no restrictive penalties The fares are available to all domestic markets, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said. While <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> says it has hired enough pilots and is keeping up with maintenance despite its strike, it has been leasing five planes and crews from its affiliated carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said more planes and crews will be temporarily leased from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are both subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern union leaders said the airline's claims to be coming back are misleading because their low fares make it impossible to make money Machinists District 100 President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said Tuesday passengers are going to fly on other airlines because `` they are very reliable, first-line carriers. They're not having phantom flights and people do n't have to worry about losing their money. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> tries to go even lower than the rest of the carriers, that's just going to compound their problems. It's going to doom the rebuilding plan, which was already doomed,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. Eastern before the March 4 strike usually had $ 1 billion in revenue per quarter. In the second quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reported revenue of $ 89.6 million. Management hurdled a major barrier to its rebuilding efforts last week when a split in pilots union ranks resulted in at least 250 more pilots returning to work, boosting to 650 the number of union members that have crossed picket lines. Eastern said that with its own recruitment and training program it now has the 1,700 pilots needed for its rebuilding plan.

 Grain futures opened lower and soybean futures were mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The weak opening caught analysts by surprise because of expectations that yesterday's rebound in prices would carry over into today's trading. The buying of soybean futures could be restricted because of the uncertain weather outlook, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Earlier this week, forecasts called for a relatively dry weekend in major crop producing states. Now more rain is being forecast. Wheat futures are expected to be pressured by reports that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s bid for 250,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under the export bonus program has been rejected. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.98 \ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to \ cent higher with September at $ 3.34 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with September at $ 1.39 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to 6 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 6.29 a bushel Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market retraced some earlier gains in moderate trading today as players remained in a cautious mode. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 6.64 points at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 7.21 points higher an hour earlier. Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 3 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 759 issues up, 493 down and 577 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 76.48 million shares. Analysts said activity had picked up slightly from the previous two days but buyers remained cautious. A lack of strength in some blue-chip stocks, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, was hindering the market, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is still looking for a base of support following the decline that began last week,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell nearly 29 points on Friday after bonds skidded on new government data that showed the economy was not as weak as previously thought. The report diminished hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would lower interest rates. Government reports this morning on July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production and capacity utilization and housing starts appeared to be in line with expectations and had little impact on the market, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that new housing starts rose 0.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.43 million units from 1.42 million units in June. Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2 percent in July, but the operating rate for the nation's factories remained flat, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said, suggesting a further easing of inflation.

 Negotiators representing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the country's major bank creditors today announced a tentative agreement on a package of debt reduction, the second pact to be reached under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's to new initiative. <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who led his country's negotiating team, said the tentative deal met the guidelines established by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> in March. `` There is no question that we must reduce the country's existing stock of commercial bank debt if we are to sustain the country's economic growth,'' he said `` At the same time new commerical bank financing is critical for our program as the combined effect of our debt reduction initiatives and our improving economy work to bring about the end of the debt problem for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' Officials said the new accord would reduce the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' $ 28 billion debt and also provide new loans, the two elements the country's negotiators had considered critical to keeping the Philippine economy expanding. The new debt package was the second agreement achieved under the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> debt plan, which is seeking to get commercial banks to forgive a portion of their Third World loans in exchange for guarantees of repayment of the remaining debt. Last month, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the developing world's second largest debtor with $ 108 billion owed, reach an accord following the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan's guidelines In the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> agreement, creditor banks were given a choice of loan reductions, interest reductions or providing new money. The Philippine agreement was reached in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between representatives of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government and a committee of banks led by <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> last May offered the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> about $ 206 million in loans that the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could use for debt relief In the present state of the market, the government can settle old loans for about 50 cents on the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the debt agreement, cited <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials and bankers saying they do n't consider the accord a break with the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan because it envisions that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will try to reduce its indebtedness. Additional money for debt relief is expected from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the fund's sister organization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The money could also be used to reduce interest rates on the old loans. The burden of interest payments is the heaviest part of the Third World's $ 1.3 trillion debt. Recent reports have said that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was less interested in reduction of its debts to the commercial banks, than in new loans from them. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> has been reported seeking $ 1.8 to $ 4 billion. Of the $ 28 billion the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> already owes, the bulk is held by governments and intergovernment bodies like the fund and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which have not permitted any reductions.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, stung by the indictment of 46 futures traders in the city, has created a permanent panel to monitor trading practices at the exchange. The Committee on Ethics and Integrity will examine all aspects of exchange trading practices `` to ensure the utmost of integrity and ethical conduct,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in a statement. It said the committee was created by the unanimous vote of the exchange's board of directors. In addition to creating the committee, the board also added its fourth outside director who is not a member of the exchange. This will bring the board's membership to 25. `` Integrity is the No. 1 priority of this exchange,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>. `` We feel that the addition of another non-member director and the establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> is a natural outgrowth of this commitment.'' A federal grand jury has indicted 46 traders at the Board of Trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, accusing them of cheating their customers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has developed a prototype version of an inexpensive sensor for leaks from underground fuel tanks. Leaking fuel can contaminate wells and reservoirs, and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> recently required that all underground fuel storage tanks be monitored for leaks by the end of 1993. <ORGANIZATION> Bellcore </ORGANIZATION> said its sensor is made of a material that stops conducting electricity when it absorbs fuel. When the electricity shuts off an alarm is triggered above ground. <ORGANIZATION> Bellcore </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is the research arm of the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies as well as <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>. It developed the sensor for manholes because fuel leaking into them can endanger workers and damage cables. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates there are leaks in more than 10 percent of the 3 million to 5 million underground storage tanks for gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil and other hydrocarbon fuels across the country. <ORGANIZATION> Bellcore </ORGANIZATION> said it has applied for a patent and plans to license the technology by the end of the year to other companies, including ones that could manufacture the sensors.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been awarded a contract valued at more than $ 150 million to make and install video hardware needed for <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>' advertising-financed daily TV news program that debuts in schools next spring, the companies announced today The contract calls for <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> to design, manufacture and install the communications systems needed for delivery of the Channel One news service and other educational programming that Whittle plans to make available to schools across the country beginning next March. Whittle has ordered about 300,000 television sets, 15,000 videocassette recorders and 8,000 satellite dishes as part of its contract with <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>. Whittle plans to give dozens of sets, two VCRs and a satellite dish to each school that agrees to run the Channel One news show with ads every day. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> also is headquartered, said the order was the largest single order of satellite broadcasting systems it ever has received. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidary of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, produces about 2.5 million televisions a year. `` We wanted this system to be designed and manufactured by the best in the business. We've got that,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to start building the 19-inch color <ORGANIZATION> Magnavox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> sets specified in the contract at its <LOCATION> Greeneville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, plant in late 1989. It expects to add more than 200 manufacturing employees at the facility. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> has contracted with RSI-SatCom Technologies Division of <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to manufacture the satellite dishes and install and service the TV sets, VCRs and satellite systems in the schools. Whittle hopes to have 1,000 schools hooked up at the national launch of Channel One in March 1990 and 8,000 schools by the end of 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> was one of three companies that Whittle previously said were under consideration for the technology contract. The other contenders were <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Videostar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connections </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Atlanta-based <PERSON> Videostar </PERSON> had supplied, installed and serviced the hardware for Whittle's seven-week test of the Channel One service in six schools last spring Awarding the technology contract would enable Whittle to reaffirm its proposed spring 1990 launch of Channel One even as some advertising executives privately speculate that <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION> is having trouble lining up sponsors and schools. Whittle executives have insisted their rollout plans are on schedule and are confident they will have a full lineup of sponsors and the 1,000 schools signed by the spring startup. The media concern plans to pay for producing the Channel One news show and the equipment for schools by selling two minutes of advertising time on each 12-minute program. Several national educational groups have decried allowing advertisers to pitch products to students while they are in class. State education officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have banned Channel One from public schools and the top education official in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has said he will reduce state aid to public schools there that air it during the school day. Just this week, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stepped up the pressure on Channel One by launching its own daily commercial-free news show designed for use in the classroom. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s project, however, does not include the donations of video gear planned by Channel One.

 Prices rallied strongly on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, boosted by a reluctance to sell stock, renewed speculative interest and an upward move on Wall Street.

 The biggest computer failure in at least 12 years delayed most trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for three hours Wednesday. Exchange officials said they suspected the problem originated in the cables feeding the system rather than a software failure. `` All we know at the moment is that right at opening there was no information on the screens to work with,'' exchange president <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said in a telephone interview shortly after the failure. Trading resumed shortly after 12:30 p.m. EDT. Because of a lack of stock price information no floor trading could take place. Trading was not interrupted on a computerized system for smaller-company stocks, which account for about 20 percent of the exchange's volume.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was mixed against other major currencies in European trading on Wednesday.

 Housing starts, driven down for four months by high mortgage rates, rose for the second straight month in July, the government reported Wednesday, and analysts said single-family construction should continue at a moderate pace the rest of the year. `` The interest rate drops in June definitely have begun to hit the market,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, who predicted further interest rate declines will keep housing activity strong in the months ahead. `` The consumer is coming off the sidelines'' as mortgage rates fall, commented <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing starts were up 0.8 percent last month, following an 8.5 percent hike in June. New homes and apartments were started in July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million, up from 1.42 million in June. Starts had fallen for four consecutive months through May as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> drove up interest rates to slow the economy and curb inflation. That was the longest string of declines since housing activity slowed for five months in February-June 1987. But as economic growth moderated, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began nudging rates downward. Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages fell from 11.22 percent in March to 9.96 percent last Friday, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the overall rebound, analysts saw problems in the multi-family component of the housing starts report. While the single-family sector posted a 6.3 percent increase to 1.04 million units annually in July, apartment starts were off 1.2 percent to 389,000 units. Part of the decline in apartment starts was attributed to a heady 32.9 percent increase in June, which chief economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said `` was unsustainable in view of the high vacancy rates.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said high rents and the elimination of tax incentives by the 1986 tax reform added to the weak multi-family pace. And housing economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON> said the 15.4 percent drop in apartment building-permit applications `` tells me that starts are going to decline sharply in the fall.'' Building permits are seen as a barometer of future multi-family housing activity. Single-family starts had risen 0.2 percent in June after falling 5.1 percent in May and 4.7 percent in April. Apartment starts had increased 5.4 percent in May after falling 26.6 percent in April. The Northeast paced overall housing construction with a 16 percent jump last month as starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 196,000 units. Starts were up 11 percent to 272,000 units in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> but fell 4.3 percent to 530,000 units in the South and fell 4.2 percent to 432,000 units in the West. Applications for building permits for both single-family houses and apartments were down 3.1 percent in July, following a drop of 2.9 percent in June. They had risen 1 percent in May and 8.5 percent in April after three consecutive monthly declines.

 A shipping company and a tanker captain pleaded guilty today to federal charges of causing a 300,000-gallon oil spill off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on June 23 and agreed to pay fines totaling $ 510,000. <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Liberian-registered company operating in <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, agreed to pay $ 500,000 to the state for environmental research. The captain, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, a 43-year-old Greek citizen, agreed to a $ 10,000 fine. Each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the federal Clean Water Act. Nearly 300,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> when the tanker World Prodigy ran aground. If convicted, the captain could have received a year in jail and a penalty equal to twice the amount of damage. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the cleanup cost alone at $ 2 million. The shipping company was also liable for twice the damage. The captain also is under indictment on state charges carrying up to a year and a month in jail and fines of $ 20,000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said he did not press for harsher penalties because the spill resulted from simple negligence. `` The captain became distracted and was also doing computations to double check'' estimates involving the unloading of the oil, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said. `` We believe it was about a six - or seven-minute lapse and there was nothing in advance of that that was not done properly. `` He was simply trying to handle more than one person could handle at one time,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiase </PERSON>, <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>' attorney. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, who had no comment after today's federal court hearing, previously told the governor and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials that he failed to turn the vessel in time to avoid the reef. He also admitted no harbor pilot was on board to take the tanker into port. Officials are investigating whether the vessel had passed the point at which one was required. <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said he felt it was more appropriate to give the money to the state, rather than to the federal government, because state beaches and wildlife sustained the most damage.

 She got caught in a blizzard in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> mountains while searching for a rugged outdoorswoman for MJB Coffee commercials. She toured the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sewer system, sang off-key for strangers in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and prowled the docks before dawn at <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> _ all in pursuit of average folks for television commercials. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, 41, is founder and president of <ORGANIZATION> Faces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Places </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> casting agency that finds `` real people'' for advertising. That task often requires the resourcefulness of a detective, the perseverance of an athlete and a talent for setting strangers at ease. Twenty people on average are interviewed for every one that winds up in an ad. `` It's a lot of work doing that,'' said <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, head of casting for the advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mather. `` There is a special talent to stopping people cold and getting them to talk.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said the key is in being a good listener. `` You have to listen for that clue to what they are hiding,'' she said. `` A man comes in saying ` I do n't know what you are interested in me for.' To get that person talking and animated is a real challenge to me.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said using such characters adds credibility to the sales pitch because `` there is a genuine quality to real people that actors ca n't give you.'' She would n't discuss what she charges clients for the far-flung talent hunts, but said the work keeps her on the road most of the year. Even when she's back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said, she's never really off the job. Take her assignment from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lottery </LOCATION>, for instance. Lottery officials, trying to refute criticism that the game preys on poor people, wanted advertising that demonstrated it appeals to rich people too. Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> staked out Wall Street and high-brow stores like <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and came up with dozens of people who got to dream aloud about what they would do with the money if they were to win the lottery. But walking home one night, she found a uniformed doorman who wound up in one ad saying that since his father liked to fish, he'd buy him a lake Asked to find an authority on the perennial `` alligators in the sewers'' rumors for an ad about a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> radio station, Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> interviewed sewer workers and said they insisted on showing her their slimy abode. No alligators showed up. But most of her work takes her outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She went to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, for instance, in search of people who would sing a jingle for Kit <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> candy bars. She crooned for some candidates to set them at ease and see if they could hold a tune. Her search for the MJB Coffee woman took her through a blizzard in the mountain passes in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before she found the right one near <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. For a <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s Fried Chicken dinner commercial, Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> and her assistants fanned out from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, searching the parks, supermarkets, financial districts, restaurants and movie waiting lines She spent days on the docks before dawn in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, seeking fishermen heading to sea who used <PERSON> Alka </PERSON> <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON> Plus for tough colds. The <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alka </PERSON> <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON> ads featured people saying why they use a specific brand. The so-called testimonial approach requires special precautions. To protect the credibility of the people chosen for such ads, Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> makes sure candidates never suspect they are under consideration for starring in a commercial. She and her assistants, describing themselves as market researchers, often stop people by asking if they would like to participate in a consumer survey. The questions are designed to determine if interviewees use a specific brand that will be advertised, without letting them know what the product is or that the admakers are seeking people for a commercial. Those who qualify are invited to another question-and-answer session, which is videotaped. The tape serves as the legal record that they volunteered they use a specific brand. Television networks, which try to guard against deceptive advertising, often demand proof that interviewees were n't coached. As an added safeguard against deception, Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said many people are n't told until after the ad has been shot that they were filmed for a commercial and will be paid for it. Those who do n't want to participate are dropped Pay varies depending on the role. Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said people in a principal role usually get a one-time fee and extra payments based on how often and how widely the ad runs. Faces and Places goes to extraordinary lengths to find credible people, but it is n't the only agency specializing in seeking non-professionals for commercial roles. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Slutsky </PERSON>, for instance, has run the New York-based PeopleFinders agency for 15 years. Among her recent finds have been several families for Surf detergent commercials and autoworkers who describe the pride they feel in their jobs in a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ad campaign. She also worked on <PERSON> Alka </PERSON> <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON> Plus commercials, persuading 30 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers to travel up to 100 miles in the dead of winter to discuss their colds with her on videotape at a Helena hotel. Eight of them made the commercial. But sometimes hard work does n't pay off. Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said she interviewed 300 people a day for a week in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, for a Slice soft drink commercial, but could n't find people who pronounced the drink's name without a Southern lilt. She said the admaker eventually flew in outsiders to appear in the ads. `` It's an exhausting process,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Hal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> ad agency that worked with Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> MJB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s dinner ads. Ms. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said she figures her work is helping people partly fulfill artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s prophecy that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. She helps them get there for about 30 seconds.

<HEAD>Customers Lose In Profit Struggle Between Dealers And Wholesalers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The sultry summer is especially sweaty this year for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> station operator <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON>, and it's not from the heat. Because his supplier is his chief competitor, <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON> says he walks a pricing tightrope. Wholesale gasoline prices have been falling, but <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON> says he ca n't pass along the savings to customers because his supplier could get mad and drive him out of business. His predicament illustrates what gasoline market experts call a nationwide problem that is hurting retail gasoline sellers and motorists alike. While wholesale prices have dropped as much as 28 cents since mid-May because of an oversupply and sluggish demand, retail prices have fallen only about 6 cents. `` It's a wholesaler's market right now,'' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kloza </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an industry newsletter. `` Distributors are wallowing like pigs in slop.'' Service station dealers blame oil companies and suppliers for keeping gasoline prices high when they should be lower. Suppliers claim tighter government regulations and higher insurance rates have raised costs. Oil companies are reluctant to talk about prices but say they're set by the market. Nonetheless, the market laws of supply and demand do n't necessarily hold in what dealers call the dog-eat-dog world of peddling gasoline `` The problem here is that some of the dogs are much bigger than others and some ca n't bite back,'' says <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON>, who operates a station outside <LOCATION> Sante </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, N.M. In rural areas like that, the distributor _ or middleman between the refiner and dealer _ often controls prices. In big cities, dealers often buy directly from the refiner. In both situations, dealers claim they do n't get the benefit of cheaper prices because they have little influence over the supply, controlled by oil companies, their refiners and distribution networks. `` In some cases, they do have a lock on the market,'' concedes <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 10,000 wholesalers and retailers nationwide. But <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> says this year's erratic price shifts are unusual and do n't reflect the broader forces shaping the price of gasoline. `` A lot of what they have in inventory they bought at higher prices and they want to go through that inventory first before they pass on the prices,'' he says. `` Ultimately competition will return.'' Gasoline prices soared after the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> due partly to concerns that there would n't be enough fuel to meet the predicted strong summer demand. Refiners rushed to produce more gasoline and by May wholesale prices were falling rapidly, but motorists did n't see much change. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, says his dealers face a problem similar to <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON>'s, but in their case the bad guys are the big oil refineries. `` The majors have created an artificial profit by keeping prices high to the dealer,'' <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON> says. `` They got prices up there and they left them up there.'' Most major oil companies decline to comment on pricing practices. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, `` We monitor our markets daily closely and we set our prices to be competitive. So it's purely and simply a response to market conditions. <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON> says his biggest complaint is that his supplier can control prices and make big profits at the same time. The supplier, for example, buys unleaded gasoline for 93.5 cents a gallon from the refiner, sells it to Rodar for $ 1.05 and charges $ 1.21 at his own pump, the same as <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON>. That means the supplier makes 27.5 cents a gallon in profit vs. 16 cents for <LOCATION> Rodar </LOCATION>. `` I hate to lead the market in any direction because he has the ability to price discipline me,'' says <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON>. `` He could sell it for what I pay for it and literally drive me out of the market.'' <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON>'s supplier, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Berridge </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Berridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, says he is `` not in business as a charitable organization. <PERSON> Berridge </PERSON> defends his prices by saying the costs of business have rocketed because of new pollution regulations requiring station owners to upgrade equipment and increase insurance coverage. <PERSON> Berridge </PERSON>, who supplies 17 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> dealers including himself, says his insurance premiums have soared to $ 204,000 a year from $ 12,000 and his cost of installing new equipment is about $ 135,000 per station. `` If you think we can stay in this business and make a profit then you do n't know this business,'' <PERSON> Berridge </PERSON> says. Prices elsewhere show the evident disadvantage dealers face in competing with oil company refiners and suppliers that also sell directly to the public. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, for example, the gap between what refiners charge suppliers and what they charge dealers was 16.35 cents as of early this month, the biggest gap this year, <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON> says. The normal gap is 1 -LCB- to 4 cents. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the average cost to wholesalers was 59.6 cents a gallon vs. 77.6 cents to dealers in late July, and in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> it was 56 cents to wholesalers vs. 69.5 cents to dealers, <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> figures show. <PERSON> Rodar </PERSON> claims he ca n't go elsewhere to get gasoline because other <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> distributors wo n't sell to him. `` We have people who want to go to these -LRB- suppliers -RRB- and buy for less but the refiner in most cases has put pressure on the wholesaler to not sell to so-called captive customers,'' says <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON>. A few states, including <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, have attempted to deal with the problem by banning oil companies from selling gasoline at the retail level, says <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Konitshek </PERSON>, a Denver-based dealer lobbyist. <PERSON> Konitshek </PERSON> says he believes pricing practices by refiners and distributors have helped drive dealers out of business. The number of dealers has fallen from 330,000 in 1972 to 108,000 today, he says. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> dealers several years ago sued major oil companies under antitrust laws, <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON> says. `` Prices dropped dramatically practically overnight'' and the dealers dropped the suit, he says. A lawsuit filed in state district court in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> last April against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> by 19 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> dealers accuses the oil company of 15 violations of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> anti-trust and deceptive trade practice laws. The counts include profiteering from dealers, saddling consumers with high fuel costs and interfering with their ability to buy cheaper gasoline elsewhere. The suit, which seeks more than $ 5 million in damages, is pending. Five similar suits are pending in other states, <PERSON> Konitshek </PERSON> says.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> moved to drop another subsidiary as it announced plans Wednesday to sell <ORGANIZATION> Bumble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Unicord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for $ 269 million in cash The deal is unusual in that the buyer is from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, a poor Southeast Asian nation that is trying to catch up with the surging <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` The acquisition of Bumble Bee marks the first time that a Thai company has purchased an American concern of this magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Dumri </PERSON> <PERSON> Konuntakiet </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Unicord </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer and controlling shareholder. `` We are particularly pleased to be acquiring a company as well-managed as Bumble Bee, with a strong brand name in the important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market,'' he said. `` We plan to continue to expand our company's food-related activities on a global scale.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> bought Bumble Bee, then privately held, for $ 242 million in July 1988. But officials said Wednesday that holding on to Bumble Bee does n't fit with the long-term strategies of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, which has been streamlining since its $ 5.7 billion acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in January. Just last week, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> announced that it will sell its <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kamp </ORGANIZATION>'s frozen seafoods division to Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 140 million in cash. `` Bumble Bee, like <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s, is an exceptionally strong company. However, it does not fit with <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s long-range strategy for its core businesses,'' <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement.

 An airplane parts distributor and its president pleaded guilty today to selling thousands of used nuts and bolts as new to several airlines and aerospace contractors. <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hauppauge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> and its president, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 42, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud. The fasteners hold together everything from wings to engines and were distributed widely in the aerospace industry from 1977 through 1988, mostly in the early 1980s, authorities said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said federal investigators have not directly linked the parts to any aircraft crashes. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said Rice Aircraft had the parts secretly stripped and replated or relubricated, and then sold them as new. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> could receive up to five years in prison, fines of $ 500,000 and court costs of $ 250,000 at sentencing Feb. 16. The company faces fines up to $ 50,000 and will share with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> in possible restitution up to $ 1 million. The guilty pleas came as the government charged three more defendants with paying kickbacks and conspiring to underbid on airplane parts contracts. Court documents indicate the recycled parts were sold to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, the Israeli government, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION>, Sikorsky, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the Brazilian airline <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. Some parts were purchased for military aircraft, including the F-111, the B-1B bomber and F-14 fighters, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's also office filed charges against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohlman </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Viejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, accusing him of acting as a middleman who conspired with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> to pay kickbacks in 1982 to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Surplus personnel. The kickbacks were paid to help <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> sell the recycled parts to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surplus </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. In exchange for the kickbacks, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Ohlman </PERSON> was given the `` last look'' at competitors' secret bids. Unrelated charges also were filed against former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Surplus employees <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They were accused of conspiring with <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connectors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to provide <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> with the `` last look'' at competitors' bids submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Surplus.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Manager Charged With Stealing $3.47 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> savings and loan branch manager has been charged with embezzling $ 3.47 million from customers' deposits over more than four years, authorities said Wednesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON>, 30, was arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday at his home in the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community of Rancho, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Russoniello </PERSON>. He released a 29-count indictment against <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON> that was returned Friday by a federal grand jury. <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON> managed a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan from 1985 to April 1989, when he was fired for reasons unrelated to the embezzlement investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. He could be sentenced to 145 years in prison and fined $ 7.25 million if convicted of all charges, <PERSON> Russoniello </PERSON> said. The problem came to light two days after <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON> was fired, when a customer asked about the $ 100,000 certificate of deposit she had taken out with <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> the previous September and was told there was no record of her account, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> in a sworn statement. She said an investigation showed that <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON> took certificate of deposit checks that were placed with him and put much of the money in a personal account, while setting aside the rest to repay earlier depositors and avoid discovery. <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>'s statement listed eight customers who were verified as having deposited money that was not in their accounts and another six who had been identified by <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, and said the list may grow. The indictment states 29 instances of embezzlement, of amounts ranging up to $ 400,000, between February 1985 and April 1989. Agents seized over $ 639,000 from accounts controlled by <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON> at seven institutions on May 9, <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> said. Court documents did not mention the recovery of any of the other allegedly embezzled funds. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanides </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mariucci </PERSON> may have put some of the money into real estate.

 The stock market rose in lackluster trading today but closed below session peaks. The market opened strong, bounced off the 2,700 mark then drifted sideways during most of the session. A brief spark in the bond market late in the day pushed stocks higher in the final hour of trading before settling back again. Analysts said investors were remaining cautious after the market's recent rally. `` It's summer caution,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, an equities analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Randall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` As the market goes up there's selling pressure and it keeps the market weak.'' Technology stocks, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, lagged during most of the session but cyclical stocks such as autos kept that sector firm, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is still looking for a base of support following the decline that began last week,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell nearly 29 points on Friday after bonds skidded following new government data that showed the economy was not as weak as thought. The report diminished hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would lower interest rates. Government reports this morning on July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production and capacity utilization and housing starts appeared to be in line with expectations and had little impact on the market, analysts said. Traders said the market could get a boost from more economic data due out Thursday and Friday on merchandise trade and consumer prices.

<HEAD>$12.1 Million Settlement for Store Applicants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has approved a $ 12.1 million settlement for job applicants at The Federated retail electronics stores who were required to take lie-detector tests. The settlement was reached just before a trial was to begin on a suit by four employees who said the tests violated the right to privacy and a state law forbidding mandatory polygraph testing by private employers. A recent federal law also bans the practice. It is the nation's largest settlement in a lie-detector case, said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON>, a lawyer for the employees. Under the agreement approved Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Agretelis </PERSON>, the four plaintiffs will get $ 22,500 each, and about $ 11 million will be put into a fund for job applicants at Federated stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from 1983 to November 1987, when the suit was filed. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> must also pay for a campaign to reach the 8,000 or more job applicants and employees at its stores who are potentially eligible for payments. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, based in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, has been bought by <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man who posed as a financial consultant and immigration lawyer avoided prison Wednesday by agreeing to a plea deal to repay more than $ 80,000 he admitted stealing from clients. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to 19 counts of an indictment that charged him with grand larceny, forgery, scheme to defraud and criminal possession of stolen property. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> bilked at least 13 people between December 1985 and July 1988 by promising services such as getting mortgages and loans, buying and leasing office space, and investing. <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> also posed as an immigration lawyer and told illegal aliens he could help them get `` green cards'' _ permanent residency cards.

According to the plea deal, if <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> repays the $ 80,950.75 that he kept, he will not go jail. There was no mention of probation or community service. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> could have gotten up to 15 years in prison on the top count, second-degree grand larceny.

<TEXT>
 The list of potential buyers for six theme parks owned by <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been narrowed to six, and analysts expect a selection may come within a month, according to a published report Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the St. Louis-based beer-maker and owner of Busch Gardens theme parks, including one in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, is the front-runner and most likely buyer, a source close to the negotiations told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> Others on the list reportedly include <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Potential buyers are being escorted this week and next through the theme parks and have received a detailed package of financial information, the Sentinel reported. `` I think they are getting much closer to making a transaction on the parks,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazzano </PERSON>, an analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage, told the newspaper. `` I think they will certainly have an announcement within a month or so.'' A call for comment on the report was placed to <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> but it was not returned. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evanson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for parks, has previously said the sale would be announced by Sept. 30, the end of <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s third fiscal quarter. Spokesmen for Anheueser-Busch and Disney each said they do not comment on speculation about acquisitions. Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> announced in June the parks would be sold to pay down some of the debt incurred two years ago defending itself against a hostile takeover attempt by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. Industry analysts estimate the parks will garner at least $ 1.3 billion.

<HEAD>Farm Credit Second-Quarter Earnings Drop 6.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Farm Credit System on Wednesday reported its second-quarter net income was down 6.5 percent from the same period last year and warned that. The system, the nation's biggest lender to agriculture, said it earned $ 159 million for the quarter ended June 30 compared with $ 170 million in the 1988 period. For the first six months of the year, the system showed profits of $ 317 million, down 5.7 percent from $ 336 million in the first half of 1988. Although overall net income declined during the quarter, net interest income rose by $ 42 million to $ 256 million. The improvement stemmed from continued improvement in the system's loan credit quality and its interest margin, the difference between its borrowing costs and interest on loans it makes, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the credit system's financing arm. `` The system's second-quarter results indicate a continued strengthening of the system's overall financial condition,'' said <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>. For the first half, net interest income was $ 496 million, up from $ 360 million in 1988. <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> also said the system was aided by repurchases by some system banks of portions of their higher-cost debt and retirement of some other higher-cost debt that matured in the last year. But the system said in a statement that `` certain system banks remain in a weakened financial condition'' and that drought conditions persist in scattered regions. It said it believes adequate allowances for loan losses are being maintained to cover credit risks from possible drought-related losses. <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> projections for the system's net cash income for 1989 remain just slightly under last year's `` This should mean stronger financial positions for system borrowers, resulting in continued improvement in the credit quality of the system's loan portfolio,'' he said. Nonaccrual loans declined to $ 2.87 billion as of June 30 from $ 3.3 billion on Dec. 31, 1988. Loans considered `` high-risk,'' excluding non-accruing loans, rose to $ 4.58 billion as of June 30 from $ 4.56 billion six months earlier, mainly due to a $ 194 million increase in the amount of restructured loans. The allowance for loan losses was $ 1.72 billion as of June 30, up from $ 1.86 billion at year-end 1988. During the second quarter, the system took an $ 80 million negative provision for loan losses, compared with $ 181 million in the 1988 quarter. The Farm Credit System is a nationwide system of federally chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers. The system took several steps last year to streamline its structure following 1987 bailout legislation that included the issuance of up to $ 4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans.

<TEXT>
 The dollar drifted mostly lower Wednesday against major foreign currencies after a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices also fell in domestic trading but made strong gains in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed off $ 2.50 at $ 368.20 a troy ounce. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 366.50 an ounce, down from $ 368.50 Monday. Currency traders said the dollar started out strong but slipped on rumors of dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and on internal market influences. `` A lot of people were squaring their positions ahead of Thursday's trade report,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutnick </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release figures on the merchandise trade deficit for June, and some traders are predicting a shortfall of around $ 9.5 billion. They said the dollar is likely to rally if the gap falls below $ 9 billion but decline should it exceed $ 10 billion. A low trade deficit is seen as positive for the dollar because it means the currency probably wo n't have to decline any further to help improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade picture. A weak dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports more attractive. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Lutnick </PERSON> said the currency market largely ignored the economic figures released Wednesday, showing industrial production rising for the first time in three months during July and housing starts continuing to rebound that month. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 141.80 yen. It traded at 142.45 yen late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 142.185 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 142.15 yen Tuesday. The dollar rose against the British pound in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and fell in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It cost $ 1.5725 to buy one pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, cheaper than $ 1.5735 late Tuesday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5805 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.5768. Other dollar rates at Wednesday's close compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.9420 West German marks, up from 1.9437; 1.67155 Swiss francs, down from 1.6748; 1.17775 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18025; 6.5615 French francs, down from 6.5780; and 1,395.00 Italian lire, down from 1,395.50. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday: 1.9470 West German marks, down from 1.9500; 1.6775 Swiss francs, down from 1.6790; 6.5700 French francs, down from 6.5835; 2.1925 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1905; 1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1822; and 1,397.75 Italian lire, up from 1,397.50. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 368.75 an ounce from Tuesday's $ 365.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 368.50 an ounce, up from $ 366.25. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 3.12 to close at $ 368.84 an ounce. Silver prices were mixed. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 5.186 a troy ounce from $ 5.242 late Tuesday.

The entertainment trade daily quoted an unidentified source Monday as saying the value of the deal could exceed $ 100 million. The Wall Street Journal carried a similar story Wednesday but said it had been unable to determine a price. Disney spokesman <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> declined to comment, but analysts said the <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> characters Miss Piggy, <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> the Frog and the other Muppets, stars of several movies as well as TV, would fit in perfectly with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and his cohorts. The Muppets are probably second only to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s characters in worldwide recognition, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Crowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weedon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Obviously it's a franchise that extends <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s already deep penetration into the children's market, if it turns out to be true,'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said. `` It makes a lot of sense in terms of both companies,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Disney could use the extra characters and could merchandise them more effectively than anyone else, and <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> has a lot of overhead,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. `` Disney's distribution network would be especially helpful for them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Henson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, includes <ORGANIZATION> Henson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which controls rights to `` The Muppet Show,'' a videocassette label, and merchandising, licensing and publishing divisions. Besides `` The Muppet Show,'' the company has produced and distributed such programs as `` Fraggle Rock,'' `` The Storyteller'' and `` Muppet Babies,'' all successful internationally. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> has distributed such shows as `` The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin'' on behalf of others, and last year, `` The Jim Henson Hour'' was broadcast briefly on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, but was pulled before the end of its run. The Muppets would join quite a menagerie of characters <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> has introduced over the past two years: <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON> and the fall release `` The Little Mermaid'' in animated movies; the top-rated `` Duck Tales'' and coming out this fall, `` Chip & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>'' on afternoon TV. There's all kinds of combinations you could extend,'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> mused. `` The Little Mermaid dates Kermit the Frog. ...

 Energy futures prices advanced modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following the release of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> figures showing a drop in petroleum stocks. On other markets, soybean futures dropped sharply and grain futures were mixed, precious metals prices retreated, copper continued its advances, and livestock and pork futures were mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents to 39 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 18.97 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent to .95 cent higher with September at 51.15 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .84 cent to 90 cent higher with September at 52.93 cents a gallon. The API weekly data indicated that gasoline stocks declined 3.5 million barrels in the latest week, while crude oil stocks were down 2.75 million barrels. Traders looked upon the data as slightly bullish, prompting the run-up in prices. `` The figures indicate lower-than-anticipated stocks,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area oil distributor. `` The street was looking for only a 1 million barrel drop in supplies.'' The strength in demand for oil products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and market strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also helped boost energy futures, analysts said. Soybean futures were off sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> because of an uncertain weather outlook, analysts said. Earlier this week, forecasts called for a relatively dry weekend, but updated forecasts now call for moderate rain over wide areas of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, which triggered commercial selling, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouba </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Corn futures ended the day higher despite forecasts of weekend precipitation. Giving support to the market were reports that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will bid this week for 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will bid for 150,000 metric tons. Wheat futures, which closed mixed, were pressured by reports that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s bid for 250,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under the export bonus program was rejected. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> rebid for 100,000 metric tons of wheat. Wheat was \ cent lower to 4 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 3.99 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 1 -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents lower with September at $ 1.38 a bushel; soybeans were 13 \ cents lower to 1 cent higher with August at $ 6.23 -LCB- a Copper prices edged up on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> despite reports the miner's strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> appears to be losing steam. The continuing strike at <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Copper </LOCATION> mine and the shutdown of mines in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> helped to support the market. Copper was .35 cent to 1.10 cent higher with August at $ 1.222 a pound. Precious metals prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, losing all the gains made in Tuesday's trading. `` This was another in a series of failed rallies,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There was little impact on the market by outside fundamentals. The market's movement was mostly technically oriented.'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the weakness in precious metal prices continues to be based on the strong dollar and weak. A weak dollar and strong inflation draws investors to gold and silver. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> also noted that stocks of gold and silver remain high. Gold settled $ 2.50 to $ 3.20 lower with August at $ 368.20 a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 6.1 cent lower with August at $ 5.186 a troy ounce. Livestock futures were lower and pork futures higher in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork futures were supported by indications that prices in the cash market will firm, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Technical factors also supported the market, as the rise in prices triggered additional buying by commission houses Livestock futures were pushed lower by <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> reports of lower prices in the cash market. Live cattle were .03 cent to .55 cent lower with August at 74.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August at 84.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .52 cent higher with August at 47.15 a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.92 cents to 2 cents higher with August at 26.82 cents a pound.

 Stocks faltered Wednesday after a strong opening rally fizzled, but the market still finished with a small gain. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.51 points to close at 2,693.29 after bouncing over the 2,700 mark shortly after the opening bell. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 819 issues up, 662 down and 512 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 150.06 million shares, up from 148.77 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 179.47 million shares. The market opened strong in what some Wall Street analysts predicted would be the launching pad for a new rally. But the market failed to sustain the momentum and began to drift. `` I'm perplexed about the action; the action is odd,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. `` You know in the movies how they say ` it's too quiet?' I expected more activity.'' New government reports on July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production and capacity utilization and housing starts were in line with expectations and had little impact on the market, analysts said. Nevertheless, the reports helped ease some market concerns that the economy is starting to heat up again, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that new housing starts rose 0.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.43 million units from 1.42 million units in June. Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2 percent in July, but the operating rate for the nation's factories remained flat, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said, suggesting a further easing of inflation. Technology stocks slumped after <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced that it expected a decline in third-quarter earnings due to a ` change in the company's product mix.' <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 -RRB- to 28 ~ on the over-the-counter market But analysts predicted the market could improve later this week with the release of the June merchandise trade and July consumer price reports on Thursday and Friday. `` Technically, the stock market is in a positive mode. The upturn is still intact,'' said <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The market is expecting a narrowing in the trade deficit to about $ 9.4 billion from $ 10.24 billion in June and a moderate gain of 0.2 percent in consumer prices, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market advanced $ 9.036 billion, or 0.27 percent, in value from Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.56 to 192.64. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 45 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> gained ~ to 51 ~ and <ORGANIZATION> Tandem </ORGANIZATION> advanced 1 -LRB- to 23 <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> closed at 115 \, down 1, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> lost -LCB- to 51 and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fell -RCB- to 44 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 395.73, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.67 to 321.81 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 0.12 to 460.79.

<HEAD>Wang Says It Will Suspend Some Debt Payments While Negotiations Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will suspend payments on $ 208.6 million in institutional debts, an apparent step to give it a stronger hand in negotiations with its bank lenders. The cash-short computer giant has been trying to negotiate a new line of credit with a group of eight banks, led by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, to replace a $ 300 million credit line that expires Sept. 30. By suspending payments on the $ 208.6 million in commercial paper and bank notes, it is putting more pressure on the eight bank lenders, since those banks also hold some of the securities in question. `` I think it's fairly straightforward that they're calling the bluff of their banks, playing hardball,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harkness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> reported a $ 424.3 million loss for the fiscal year that ended June 30, and had speeded up plans to lay off more than 2,200 workers by Sept. 30. <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, the founder, chief executive and chairman, has recently undergone treatment for cancer. Last week, in an unexpected move, his son and heir apparent, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, stepped down as president and chief operating officer. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has $ 962 million in short - and long-term debt altogether and is trying to restructure all of it <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stock fell 50 cents a share to $ 6 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Company Chairman <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said in a terse statement that the company would suspend principal and interest payments on certain institutional debts. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON>, director of investor relations, said later the freeze would apply to $ 125 million of commercial paper, as well as $ 83.6 million in notes payable to banks. <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> said the negotiations had been `` long and difficult and arduous and complex.'' `` When you're dealing with a consortium of eight banks ... getting nine parties to come to an agreement gets complex,'' he said. <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> stressed that the move applied only to institutional debts, and said the company intended to remain current on all other obligations, including trade credits, operating costs, vendor bills, customer service, and overseas operations, while negotiations continue. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said despite those woes <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s balance sheet at year-end was `` a fairly strong one.'' `` That, particularly as modern balance sheets go, is a pretty bankable situation,'' he said. `` It does n't reflect tremendously well on the banking group if, with that balance sheet, they ca n't put together a lending agreement and a loan. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> added, `` They sure have cast down the gauntlet.'' Another analyst said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s action was unusual but not unprecedented. `` They're saying well, we do n't like the new terms and we do n't have the funds to pay you under the old terms,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastore </PERSON>, vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> But he added, `` Certainly if a company ca n't pay its bills and meet the terms of its original obligation to the banks, that does n't look good.''

 Oil futures prices rose Wednesday in light trading, boosted by new industry statistics showing a sharp reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline supplies. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unleaded regular gasoline for September delivery jumped 0.87 cent to 52.93 cents a gallon. Most contracts for later delivery showed similar increases. The September-delivery contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed 29 cents higher at $ 18.97 per 42-gallon barrel. Contract months for later delivery posted smaller advances. Heating oil futures, which led the market higher last week, also posted gains. The September contract rose 0.87 cent to finish at 51.15 cents a gallon. Market participants said prices were lifted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s latest weekly report, released Tuesday after the close of trading. The report showed a drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline stocks of around 3.5 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 11, to 222.93 million barrels.

<HEAD>Report: Jets Have Experienced 16 Serious Engine Failures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some airline safety experts say they're surprised at figures showing that wide-body jets have experienced at least 288 instances of engine trouble in the past six years, including 16 serious incidents that could have led to a crash. The figures were obtained from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> records and reported in an article in Wednesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's certainly of concern,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> of the 110,000-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously any time you have an uncontained engine explosion, you've opened the door to catastrophe.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nance </PERSON>, a pilot and air safety analyst who generally defends the safety of airlines, said, `` It is higher than I would have expected.'' The 16 serious incidents occurred when engine parts tore into the engine casing or hurtled out of the engine, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records. It is believed that debris thrown from a failed engine severed hydraulic lines on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that crashed in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, on July 19. The crash, which killed more than 100 people, remains under investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> numbers are based on the agency's service difficulty reports since 1983 for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CF6 </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whitney JT9 engines, the ones used on the most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wide-body jets. The figures exclude smaller aircraft that are far more numerous in airline fleets. The number of incidents detailed in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records is surprising to some, the newspaper said, because after the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crash the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said there have been only 12 other `` uncontained'' engine failures on any type of commercial jetliner since 1982. But that counts only incidents in which there was injury, death or what the agency regards as an immediate threat to safety. Engine makers and airlines, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, stress that serious engine breakups are still rare. Blades and other parts breaking away from engines are a fact of life, since the blades often spin at over 10,000 revolutions per minute and are weakened by birds, stress and ice. But such incidents rarely result in accidents because the parts usually are contained in the engine casing or spit out in the engine's exhaust. Engine designs use the best available technology, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, an engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, `` but just like anything else in this world, there are times when all that does n't come to fruition. Said <PERSON> Nance </PERSON>: `` The problem is not that the engines are going to come apart. The problem is trying to contain them when they do.'' Of the 288 instances of engine trouble on wide-body jets, at least 94 occurred when blades broke from compressors and turbines and seriously damaged engines but did n't spew parts out of the engine casing. In 58 more cases, records are n't conclusive on whether the blades simply cracked or broke off, but they indicate the engines often were seriously damaged. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records often are n't clear about the severity of the damage in the 16 cases of `` engine case penetration.'' Reports in four of the incidents note the case was violated but do n't detail the damage. Two say parts protruded from or were embedded in the casing.

 A computer equipment failure at the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> halted most trading for three hours Wednesday, making it the exchange's longest technically related halt since computers went into use 26 years ago. The shortened trading day did n't harm the market. The exchange's composite index rose 11.27 points to close at 4,013.36 in a moderately active trading of 32.5 million shares Trading stopped 11 minutes after the market opened at 9:30 a.m. and did n't resume again until 12:31 p.m. It closed at its usual time of 4 p.m. Trading continued on the exchange's CATS system _ computer assisted trading system _ where the exchange's smaller companies are handled. But only about 20 per cent of the exchange's trading occurs on CATS.

 Some countries are lowering barriers to foreign ownership of their oil and other resources, but many governments hold on to restrictions that give their own citizens an advantage, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. `` To the extent that a local industry has raw material or other production cost advantages due to a government program, the products of the industry obtain an advantage in world markets,'' it said.

In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, production costs are as much as 19.25 percent lower than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> due to savings from lower priced resources. The report added that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports increased because of these price advantages. The report, made at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, concentrated on investment in the oil industry. It found wide variation in the effects of other governments' policies on foreigners <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, for example, has recently permitted companies to be treated like those locally owned as long as 51 percent of the stock is held by <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> nationals. But foreigners are still limited to a minority interest. Until recently, only companies completely owned by <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> citizens were allowed to distribute goods. Though the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is now permitting foreigners to hold a majority of the stock in some joint ventures, they are limited to a minority holding in energy and the major industries that consume it. The Communist government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> started encouraging foreign investors much earlier than the Soviets but still subjects them to a long bureaucratic approval process, the report said. A new law in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> this year automatically approves companies owned by foreigners if the investment is less than $ 100 million. But the foreign share in a telecommunications firm is stil limited to 49 percent and needs the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The Mexican government continues to hold exclusive rights to explore and develop oil and natural gas, and to produce basic petrochemicals, radioactive material and energy. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> insists on 50 percent ownership by its nationals before issuing licenses to exploit natural resources in frontier areas. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> keeps exclusive control of minerals, except for oil and natural gas. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> controls the domestic oil industry through the state-owned Petroleos de <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Most members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expoprting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- control their domestic energy industries.

 Stock brokers who deal in low-priced, often risky securities known as `` penny stocks'' must obtain a new customer's written approval before completing a sale, under a rule adopted Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The new rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the fraudulent sale of penny stocks, which are usually not traded on exchanges or quoted on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> Dealers Automated Quotation -LRB- NASDAQ -RRB- System, commonly known as the national over-the-counter market. The new rule will take effect Jan. 1, 1990. In other matters, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> voted to seek comment on: revised rule proposals for disclosure of securities trades by corporate officers and other insiders; a proposal to raise the minimum net capital required of registered broker dealers to as much as $ 250,000 depending on the ther method of computing net capital. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also was supposed to consider new rules on information to be disclosed during takeover battles, but those proposals have been shelved until early September to give the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> more time to consider the issue. Because most penny stocks, usually selling for a few cents to a few dollars per share, are not listed nationally information about them is hard to come by and fraudulent claims are difficult to dispute. Before the commission voted unanimously 5-to-0 to approve the rule, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the problem was of `` great concern'' to the agency. But he and several other members of the commission also noted most penny stocks and penny stock dealers are legitimate. Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he was distressed that because of bad publicity, `` penny stock is almost becoming synonymous with fraud and manipulative practices.'' Two weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with an alleged $ 10 million penny stock scam in which the companies' share prices were artificially raised and the shares then sold at large profits. Last fall, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> created a <ORGANIZATION> Penny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> that found a key element of penny stock fraud was high-pressure sales tactics _ often over the telephone _ on small, unsophisticated investors. Industry officials say the problem lies with unscrupulous salesmen who pressure investors to buy the high-risk stocks of new or small companies, or with crooks peddling the stocks of sham companies. The `` rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse'' is `` the No. 1 threat'' facing small investors, according to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a state-level investment regulators group. In the first half of the current fiscal year, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has received 2,462 complaints about penny stock fraud compared to 1,510 for all of last year. `` This will help us in our investigations,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, head of the task force, said of the new rule. `` Here's something that will require writings to be made,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, who is also an associate director of enforcement with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The new rule, first proposed in February, will require brokers and dealers to obtain written purchase agreements from new customers before completing their first three transactions in stocks that are neither traded on stock exchanges nor through the NASDAQ system. The rule would apply to stocks selling at $ 4.99 or less per share or to stocks issued by companies with less than $ 2 million in tangible assets. Broker-dealers also would have to obtain financial information from the customer such as income, investment experience and investment objectives; determine whether the transaction is suitable for the customer's needs and write down the basis for that determination. Securities issued by some companies and sales to certain investors would be exempt from the ` put it in writing' requirements.

<TEXT>
 Those exceptions include initial public offerings that are scheduled to be listed with NASDAQ or a stock exchange and customers who have dealt with the broker previously.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has refused to take action against the chairman of a major grain company in response to member complaints that his comments about the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> have damaged the exchange, officials said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said in a notice to members that to punish <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> for his comments about the exchange would be inappropriate because <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> is not a Board of Trade member. Last month, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Archer-Daniels-Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after the exchange ordered traders to reduce their holdings in the July soybean futures contract to 1 million bushels. The July 11 order was apparently made to break up an alleged attempt by the Italian grain merchant <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> SpA to corner the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean market. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has denied making such an attempt. After the order was issued, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> has exposed itself to cornering attempts because it has fallen behind the times. He said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> had become `` more of a gambling institution than a hedging center.'' A petition circulated by members of the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> contended that <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON>' comments constitute actions detrimental to the welfare of the CBOT. The petition, signed by more than 100 members, asked the exchange's board of directors to suspend the clearing privileges of <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Archer-Daniels-Midland </ORGANIZATION>'s CBOT clearing affiliate. In a letter dated Aug. 14, <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> that as chairman of a member firm, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> is obligated to present information to the exchange on any member in violation of the exchange's rules. `` Accordingly, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> remains open to receiving any information which your firm wishes to provide in evidence of possible rule violations under the Exchange's purview,'' <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> wrote.

<TEXT>
 American-owned assembly plants refuse to sign with a `` corrupt'' union leader in order to end a 23-day-old labor dispute because giving in would be `` like spreading a cancer'' throughout the industry, a spokesman said Wednesday. `` Nobody is understanding the real issue here; the obvious and blatant corruption in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kezsbom </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures soft luggage. The corporation's assembly plant in this northern border city is one of 15 companies involved in a union power struggle with a local leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, or CTM. The <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> put up strike flags and closed the gates of the plants July 25 after <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the union leader representing the workers, withdrew from the CTM. The strike is costing the plants about $ 500,000 a day in lost production and at least two have threatened to pull out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> argued that because the plants had no <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> union leader, he had the right to declare himself in charge, said managers who have spoken to him. The <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> is the most powerful labor union in <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state and few dare to challenge its authority. So it was a rare show of force when about 900 out of some 2,000 plant workers affected by the strike ripped down <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> strike flags Tuesday, locked themselves in their plants and returned to work. The workers have vowed to remain inside the plants until the dispute is solved. `` The important thing is that we're at our jobs. We do n't want these plants to close,'' said <PERSON> Gustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, a worker at <LOCATION> Invamex </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of the <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION>, Ohio-based <ORGANIZATION> Invacare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wheelchair manufacturer. The strike flags were replaced early Wednesday by the local labor arbitration board and <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON>. Groups of about a dozen of <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>' men stood outside the plants with orders `` not to let anybody in or out,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivo </PERSON>, a laborer at a plant unionized under <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. The labor board, controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION>, has authorized <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> as union leader but the plants are arguing against that decision in federal court and with top federal authorities. <PERSON> Kezsbom </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, that the companies have decided to stand firm against <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> because he is known as a `` corrupt individual.'' He said that giving in would be `` like spreading a cancer'' throughout the industry. <PERSON> Kezsbom </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> forces companies to allow his union to control trucking contracts, transportation of waste and even food coupons so that workers have to buy food from stores he controls. There is no way to control business costs when dealing with a union head whose demands escalate each day, he said. Reporters have been unable to locate <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> for several days at his headquarters, his home or the places he is known to frequent. <PERSON> Kezbom </PERSON>, meanwhile, denounced <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON>'s `` gangster-type tactics'' in dealing with workers in the middle of the night. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON> toured most of the plants about 1 a.m. and told workers locked inside that they should leave peacefully or the police would take them out, workers interviewed said. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he recommended the workers leave to `` prevent confrontations'' that might occurr. But <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, Wis.-based West Bend plant, said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lira </PERSON> `` harassed employees and intimidated them try to get them to leave.'' The workers say they have no obligation under Mexican labor law to sign with the <ORGANIZATION> CTM </ORGANIZATION> and, in fact, are happy with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> no matter whom he represents.

 Investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Wednesday increased his bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to $ 6.2 billion and set the stage for a proxy battle for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the price could go higher after a review of the company's internal data. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offered $ 240 a share, or $ 5.4 billion, earlier this month, revitalizing interest in buying Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. His latest offer is $ 275 a share. The stock closed Wednesday at $ 251.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down $ 2.50. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' new bid was revealed after the market closed. Last weekend, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> officials reportedly met with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to discuss a possible management-employee buyout or recapitalization to put a large chunk of shares into an employee stock ownership plan as a means of blocking any hostile takeover. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> emphasized that he does not want to be regarded as an unfriendly suitor. `` Our continuing desire -LRB- is -RRB- to proceed on a friendly basis,'' said spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON>. Meanwhile Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> said it had been served with a stockholder consent form from <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> asking shareholders to remove all members of the company's board of directors except Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, reduce the board's membership to five from 16 and elect a new slate headed by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Eastern Settles Pension Payment Suit With Pilots Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to pay more than $ 32 million into the pension fund of striking pilots to settle a 2-year-old suit against the financially troubled carrier. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, predicted the payment will be approved in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has supervised <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s finances since the carrier filed for Chapter 11 protection five days after the March 4 strike by pilots, flight attendants and machinists. The settlement sets a Sept. 15 deadline for the payment of the $ 32 million, which represents regular company payments into the fund and interest from 1985 to 1988, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said. A 1987 <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, claimed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> violated federal law by failing to make scheduled pension payments. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> does not approve the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said it would file another suit. Eastern, which was reportedly losing $ 1 million a day before the strike, was granted two waivers by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> since 1985 to withhold some pension payments, said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Miami-based carrier. Since the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to rebound as a smaller airline. The company has stated its goal of rebuilding to two-thirds of its 1,040 pre-strike flight schedule. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owes a total of about $ 98 million in outstanding payments and interest to its seven employee pension funds. He was unaware of any other employee legal action similar to the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> suit. Part of the carrier's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 include on-time payment to its pension plans. Eastern announced in June it plans to pay about $ 100 million into various pension plans by Sept. 15. On June 1, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 3.1 million to several benefit plans to settle a case in which the government alleged the carrier illegally tapped employee funds to pay corporate expenses. Eastern entered into the agreement without admitting or denying it violated federal pension laws.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was trading higher against the Japanese yen Thursday morning on expectations of an improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell back. The dollar opened at 142.25 yen, up 0.45 yen from Wednesday's close of 141.80 yen In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight it had closed at 142.20 yen. During the morning trading session, the dollar moved in a range of 142.20 to 142.45 yen, closing the session at 142.26 yen. An exchange dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday's announcements of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> housing starts and industrial capacity utilization rates had little effect on the market. `` The upper end -LRB- of this morning's range -RRB- is restrained by central bank intervention, and at the lower end buyers appear,'' the dealer added, speaking anonymously. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> reported that housing starts had increased 0.8 percent in July, while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> announced that factory capacity utilization had risen marginally to 83.6 percent. Rather than concentrating on these figures, dealers were anticipating an improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade statistics for June, to be announced later Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the dealer said. Other dealers said the market lacked direction as it waited for the trade figures. But most participants expected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for June to show an improvement. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which reached a record-high Wednesday by gaining 273.46 points, lost 79.65 points, or 0.22 percent, to close the morning session at 35,004.50. Traders reported a shift of buying interest from high-priced issues, which were mainly purchased for quick profit-taking, to shares with lower price-earnings ratios.
